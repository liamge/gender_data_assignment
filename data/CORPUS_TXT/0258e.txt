<heading>PART 1: EVALUATION</heading><heading>Limitation of an expert evaluation with other user evaluation. </heading>There are always few limitations in the evaluation done by expert and evaluation by a general user. An expert user requires a wide range of facilities and finer more precise tools then a less knowledgeable person. The evaluation of system depends upon many factors such as memory load, time, and accuracy. The expert user can tolerate a much higher memory load with apparent less prompting which might not be the case with general user. Indeed, evidence indicates that a system design that works well for the inexperienced user can be slow, crude for the expert. Hence there is a limitation on the evaluation done by expert is because of different level of understanding and requirement in comparison with general evaluation. <heading>Strengths of the existing Programmer:</heading>The programmer provides an impressive digital display about time, temperature and other information about boiler, water and heating on button. The programmer model doesn't hold extra buttons .The system is compact and provides enough information for the user to operate things like changing the temperature or time. The information provider button is also one of the strength of the existing programmer, which is important for any model, as user might need information at any point during operating the device. The model shows good mapping at many points in the design as use of water tap to show water and bag for holiday are good examples to give user the quick idea for the button use. <heading>Weaknesses of the existing Programmer:</heading>An effective interaction design is one in which a user carries out his work with minimal conscious attention to his tools and maximal effectiveness. The existing programmer model holds weaknesses, which might lead to inaccuracy, and more time spent by user. The following weaknesses are encountered in the model: The user of sliders for hot water and heating doesn't provide enough information for using it by the user. The existing programmer model doesn't have any sound effect or flashing effect, which can prompt the user of running of programming or error in its use. The placement of buttons/switches on the model is not very well done, as the buttons for the hot water and the hot water slider should be placed closed to each other in order to show relationship between them and that might reduce the short term memory load of the user. The central heating system programmer model doesn't hold any display of the progress of the user or eventual success of finishing the task .As the setting of water or heating consist of few steps and if some kind of information be provided to user by either flashing LED's or sound could bring accuracy in the use of the programmer model. <heading>PART 3: HIGH-LEVEL USABILITY IMPROVEMENTS</heading>The quality of an interaction design is determined by the combination of three factors: Time, Accuracy and Pleasure. The new central Heating Programmer designed takes these factors into consideration before re-designing, which will help in improving the learning about the device for the user. Using a Temperature Knob gives the user easy and quick idea of its use. This reduces the time the user might take in understanding things with which he might not be very familiar, using things or devices which the user is familiar reduces the time it takes in learning about the device working. The use of LED button for different setting makes it easy for the user as the flashing of the LED gives the user indication of his progress and placing the panel close to each other because of their link makes it easier for the user to handle and it reduces the short term memory load. The use of signs around the buttons reduces the perceptual learning time, which is the time it takes for the user to learn the pattern to be used as signature for the elementary figure. The sound effect produced in the model when the user does the changes and user pressed the run programme button gives the user the indication of the eventual success. <heading>Memory:</heading>The new programmer design tries to balance out both the long term and short-term memory load. The user of patterns to techniques and prompting the action is useful in reducing the long-term memory load. The light buttons provided above the heater and water setting flashes and prompts the user when the user presses the change setting button on the left panel of buttons. The use of flashing LED Button for Run Programme reduces the long term load as the user don't really have to remember much amount of information as the Led keeps flashing until the user presses the run programme button so it provides the user a prompting action during the time. The use of same signs for water and heating in the programmer model reduces the short term load as the eye catching signs will prompt the user of their link with each other during the use of system. <heading>Ergonomic Quality:</heading>An effective design is one in which a user carries out the work with minimal attention and maximal effectiveness. More learning time and recall time are the problems which might the user face during the use of the programmer. The problem are tried to be solved by using familiar patterns and prompting the user for the next step and prompting it for the final achievement by the use of green LED light buttons and sound in the new system design. They programmer model is tried to have no unrealistic and uncertainty in small amount of memory load which is present .The problem of errors and fatigue is tried to be over ridden by making a user friendly model and the model which provide a bit of pleasure to the user. <heading>PART 4: LOW-LEVEL USABILITY IMPROVEMENTS</heading>In the new designed model the feedback is provided to the user by the digital display screen where the screen is updated simultaneously with the changes and also producing sound effect and flashing LED, which prompts the user about his or her action. The Yellow LED provided above the setting buttons provides the user with feedback when one of the setting buttons pressed. The cancel button introduced in the new model offers forgiveness to the user .As the user might want to return to the last settings of the system, which could be achieved by just pressing the cancel button .The cancel buttons cancel all the last changes made to the setting and bring back the system to the original position. The design also covers the concept of mapping where the use of color and pictures next to the buttons provides the user quick and easy way of understanding the functionality of different types. As for example the use of tap and the holiday picture near the button give the user quick idea of its use at the first glance. And the use of colored LED gives an eye-catching signal to users progress. The Affordance, which is the physical properties, that determines how a control can be used is also available by the use of temperature knob and different LED switches which are used in the system in order to make it more user friendly. The consistency is achieved in the model by using same type of buttons in the whole system which doesn't confuses the user .The use of three panels for setting of heating and water seems to be consistent with the model and provide user with good information of its pattern and links to use. The constrain is added in the new design which prompts the user with a buzz sound if the user tries to change the temperature to a very high degree or for other some illogical error. Progressive disclosure is the single best strategy to resolve the paradox of technology. Before re-designing the model I took into consideration the different level of users for the programmer. Designer must understand who the user will be and what task they will do .In the Heating Programmer System the user is supposed to be people of all age groups above 18.This idea helped to hide few minute information to give on the system, without the idea of the user the designer is always uncertain about many issues. <heading>PART 2: THE IMPROVED DESIGN ID: </heading><heading>CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEM PROGRAMMER</heading>The central heating system programmer is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for the user so that the user gets the result in minimum time with high degree of accuracy. The System is provided with the different set of buttons and switches with brief description as follows: Temperature Knob: The temperature knob provides the user facility to change the temperature for the heating and water temperature with high accuracy. Setting Touch buttons: The Light emitting switches are used for changing different modes for different setting on the board. Two colored buttons are provided on the interface, which prompts the user about his action and next steps required for the updating. The system is designed to make it eye catching for the user and pleasure which are very important for the design of the system. The cancel button used on the interface provides the user with the facility to cancel the changes and bring back to the last state of the system. The sound button provided on the interface provides the user with the indication for the successful updating of the system by giving a buzz sound at the end of the run programme. The functioning of the interface is tried to be made easier by using mapping and patterns familiar to the user. <picture/>
