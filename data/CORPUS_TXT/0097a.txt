<abstract><heading>Abstract</heading>Maternal effect genes are genes expressed during oogenesis in order to produce mRNAs or proteins required for early development. These genes play a vital role in producing asymmetrical divisions, cell-cell interactions and determining cell fates in the early embryo. Such genes include the par genes, which are required to produce an asymmetrical first cleavage, and to allow for asymmetrical distributions of cell fate determinants. Maternal effect genes are involved in the early specification of cell fates, for example skn-1 encodes a transcription factor to determine EMS cell fate, and pie-1 determines germline cell fate through transcriptional repression. Early cell-cell signalling requires the glp-1 and apx-1 genes to act as ligand and receptor, in order to specify conditional cell fates. The maternal effect genes encode a variety of different proteins which together initiate complex patterns of differentiation required for C. elegans to develop into a complete organism. </abstract><heading>1. Introduction </heading>Caenorhabditis elegans is a small soil nematode, used as a model organism in the study of development for many reasons, but one clear advantage is its invariant lineage. Cell divisions occur at the same time, in the same place in each organism, so that each cell, at each stage of development will always assume the same fate. This allows the same patterns of development to be studied in numerous individuals. The early lineages that shall be discussed in this essay can be seen in figure 1. <figure/>C. elegans is hermaphrodite, and fertilisation occurs in a sperm storage organ. Fertilization triggers several important events, including the completion of meiosis in the oocyte arrested in prophase of meiosis I, and the production of a protective chitin eggshell, which gives the embryo an oval shape. The two pronuclei then fuse, and the mitotic apparatus for the first division develops along the long axis of the egg, which becomes the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. However, the spindle becomes displaced towards the posterior pole resulting in an asymmetrical division, that gives rise to the larger anterior AB blastomere, and smaller P 1 blastomere. This asymmetric division is vital in the development of the C. elegans embryo as it means that the daughter cells will contain differing amounts of cell fate determinants. Early developmental patterning involves both asymmetric divisions and cell-cell interactions in order to correctly determine cell fates, and this not only occurs in C. elegans development, but in the development of most organisms.&  <enote>Gotta, M. and Ahnringer, J.

These genes play a vital role in producing asymmetrical divisions, cell-cell interactions and determining cell fates in the early embryo. Maternal effect genes are commonly studied by looking at the development of an embryo from a mother carrying a mutation in one such gene. These mutations are known as 'maternal effect mutations,' and in this essay these embryos shall be termed 'mutant embryos,' although it is the mother who actually carries the mutation. <heading>2. The par genes and setting up the initial asymmetries in the embryo</heading>The par genes, named for partitioning defective, are important in setting up the initial asymmetries in the embryo, leading to the asymmetrical first division. They are maternal effect genes, whose role is to provide polarity information during the first cell cycle in order for the correct asymmetrical localisation of cell fate determinants.3 As the oocyte enters the spermathecum, the sperm storage organ, the pronucleus moves away from the pole of entry, and the sperm fertilises the egg at the opposite pole. As well as triggering completion of meiosis and eggshell production, sperm entry specifies the A-P axis. The entry point of the sperm and the associated centrosome it brings to the oocyte, determines the posterior pole.2 The sperm pronucleus directs cytoplasmic streaming, with internal cytoplasm directed towards the posterior and cortical cytoplasm directed away to the anterior. This causes a deep invagination of the membrane, called a pseudocleavage furrow. The maternal pronucleus migrates towards the paternal pronucleus, and then together they migrate towards the centre, so that the first mitotic spindle forms along the A-P axis. However, the spindle becomes displaced towards the posterior pole, and this requires the PAR proteins. <enote>Cuenca, A. A., Schetter, A., Aceto, D., Kemphues, K. and Seydoux G. Polarization of the  C. elegans zygote preceeds via distinct establishment and maintenance phases 2003 Development 130:1255-1265 </enote>Following sperm entry, PAR-1 and PAR-2 localise to the posterior cortex, and PAR-3 and PAR-6 localise to the anterior cortex. PAR-4 and PAR-5 are enriched in the cortex, but are not polarised. The sperm's ability to affect PAR distribution has been found to be dependant upon an intact actin cytoskeleton, as when this is disrupted with cytochalasin D, the first division is no longer asymmetric.2&4 The anterior PAR-3 and PAR-6 forms a complex with a protein kinase C, PKC-3, which in par-2 mutants becomes delocalised and found throughout the cortex. Oppositely PAR-2 is no longer restricted to the posterior in par-3, par-6 and pkc-3 mutants. Cuenca et al 5 used GFP fusions to study the localisation patterns of the PAR proteins and proposed a model based upon two distinct phases, establishment and maintenance, involved in polarising the cortex. During establishment it is proposed that signalling events occur between the sperm asters and the actin cytoskeleton to displace the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 complex to the anterior cortex, which allows PAR-2 to accumulate in the posterior cortex. The maintenance phase then involves PAR-2 preventing the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 complex returning to the posterior domain. The displacement of the first mitotic spindle requires a greater pulling force at the posterior aster than the anterior. It has been found that in par-2 mutant embryos, PAR-3 expands to the posterior and exerts a low force. In par-3 mutants, PAR-2 expands to the posterior and exerts a low force. In each case, the result is that the spindle remains central.1&2 This implicates the par-2 and par-3 genes, and the correct localisation of their gene products, in having direct effect on spindle displacement. LET-99 is a protein that requires the par genes for its correct localisation at the cortex, within a band positioned slightly posteriorly, as seen in figure 2. In let-99 mutant embryos, the displacement of the spindle is defective. It has therefore been suggested that cortical forces on microtubules are lowest where LET-99 is highest, allowing the stronger posterior forces to displace the spindle.2 This process can be seen in figure 2. <figure/>The PAR proteins are vital in displacement of the first mitotic division spindle, and are also required for the asymmetrical localisation of cell fate determinants into P 1 and AB. PAR-1 for example, restricts MEX-5 and MEX-6 to the anterior somatic blastomeres, which in turn helps to restrict PIE-1, MEX-1 and POS-1 to the posterior germ line blastomeres.4& Overall, sperm entry causes polarisation of the PAR proteins in the cortex, and this in then converted into cytoplasmic polarity.2 <enote>Spike, C.A. and Strome, S.

Bowerman et al  screened for mutants lacking pharyngeal cells, and found such mutants were defective in a gene called skn-1. Normal sperm could not rescue embryos whose mothers were homozygous mutants, therefore it is the maternal expression of the gene that is required, so skn-1 is a maternal effect gene. The role of the skn-1 gene is to determine EMS cell fate. <enote>Bowerman, B., Eaton, B. A. and Priess, J. R. skn-1, a maternally expressed gene required to specify the fate of ventral blastomeres in the early C. elegans embryo 1992 Cell 68:1061-1075 </enote><figure/>Immunofluorescence spectroscopy shows that skn-1 mutants have less intestinal tissue when compared to the wild-type, as well as lacking both EMS and ABa derived pharyngeal cell types.6 It was also found that skn-1 mutants had extra hypodermal cells where the pharynx and intestine would be. Through laser ablation, where a laser microbeam was used to destroy all but the EMS blastomere, it was determined that the EMS blastomere produced hypodermal and body wall muscle cells in skn-1 mutants. This therefore shows that skn-1 is required to specify EMS to produce both pharyngeal and intestinal cell fates. The skn-1 gene was isolated and cloned by Bowerman et al. 6 The gene was found to encode a protein with a twenty-five amino acid region with similarity to the DNA binding domain of the 'bZIP' family of transcription factors. SKN-1 however lacks a leucine zipper required for the dimerisation which permits DNA binding in bZIP transcription factors. Evidence suggests that SKN-1 has an alternative DNA binding domain termed the 'SKN domain,' and that it binds to DNA as a monomer. This indicates that skn-1 may direct the fate of EMS through activating embryonic transcription of genes required for pharyngeal and intestinal fate. Figure 4, shows that SKN-1 localises to the nucleus, further supporting the idea of SKN-1 being involved in the regulation of embryonic transcription. Since EMS cell fates appear to be specified autonomously,6 the localisation of a transcription factor could explain this. <enote>Blackwell, K. T., Bowerman, B., Priess, J. R., Weintraub, H. Formation of a monomeric DNA binding domain by SKN-1 bZIP and homeodomain elements 1994 Science 266:621-628 </enote>Staining for the SKN-1 protein shows there is an unequal distribution of SKN-1 from the 2-cell stage, as seen in figure 4. P 1 contains much higher levels of the SKN-1 protein than AB in the wild-type embryo. The levels in AB could be assumed to be too low to induce pharyngeal cell fates. When P 1 divides however, it is found that SKN-1 is equally distributed in P 2 and EMS. This would suggest that other factors prevent P 2 from responding to SKN-1, as P 2 does not produce pharyngeal cells in the wild-type embryo. <picture/>It has been found that mutations in the maternal effect gene mex-1 cause both AB and P 1 to produce MS-like descendants, which have the intrinsic ability to produce pharyngeal cells, as discussed above. It therefore appears that MEX-1 activity is required for the restriction of SKN-1 activity to P 1 at the first division. In par-1 mutants, where there is a deficiency in A-P axis establishment, AB descendants also acquire a SKN-1 dependant ability to produce pharyngeal cells, however in this case all 4 blastomeres at the 4-cell stage may produce pharyngeal cells. This indicates PAR-1's more general role in the distribution of cell fate determinants. However in both par-1 and mex-1 mutants intestinal cells are not produced.8 This indicates that another factor may interact with SKN-1 to produce intestinal cells from E. When the maternal effect gene pie-1 is mutant, P 2 acquires the ability to produce pharyngeal cells. This suggests that PIE-1 is required to restrict skn-1 activity to EMS at the second cleavage. A simple diagram demonstrating these conclusions is represented in figure 5. <enote>Bowerman, B., Draper, B. W., Mello, C. C. and Priess, J. R. The maternal gene skn-1 encodes a protein that is distributed unequally in early C. elegans embryos 1993 Cell 74:443-452 </enote><figure/><heading>4. pie-1 and mex-1 genes in germline development and transcriptional silencing</heading>We have seen that P 2, a germline blastomere, contains the somatic differentiation factor SKN-1. pie-1 is a maternal effect gene, and its role appears to be directing differences between EMS and P 2 as seen in figure 5, and it perhaps does so through preventing a germline response to SKN-1.8& The pie-1 mRNA appears to be found in all blastomeres until the 4-cell stage, where it is degraded in somatic blastomeres, whilst being maintained in the germline blastomeres. The PIE-1 protein is first detectable at low levels in the posterior cytoplasm of P 0, and following division it is then present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of P 1, but at low or undetectable levels in AB.9 PIE-1 is then localised to the germline blastomere in each of the cleavages that follow, and is detected in the nuclei of Z2 and Z3. The asymmetrical distribution is achieved by PIE-1 accumulating equally at each centrosome of a dividing germline blastomere, but following rotation of the mitotic spindle levels decrease rapidly at one of the centrosomes, so that only the germline daughter cell contains PIE-1 at its centrosome.8 The asymmetrical distribution of PIE-1 explains how it can prevent SKN-1 activity in P 2 and not EMS. <enote>Mello, C. et al. The PIE-1 protein and germline specification in  C. elegans embryos 1996 Nature 382:710-712 </enote>The pie-1 gene has been cloned, and found to encode a novel nuclear protein, PIE-1, which contains two zinc-finger motifs.9 PIE-1 in the cytoplasm is associated via its second zinc finger to P granules,5 germline associated particles found only in germline blastomeres.9 The first zinc finger has been proposed to function in meditating PIE-1's own degradation in somatic blastomeres. ZF1 of PIE-1 (as well as MEX-1, POS-1 and MEX-5) interacts with a protein that forms part of a ubiquitin ligase, which targets proteins for degradation in a proteasome.5 This is thought to be a mechanism of preventing the accumulation of germ plasm components in somatic blastomeres. Through monitoring the transcription of a chromosomally integrated transgene it has been found that embryonically transcribed RNAs can be detected in somatic blastomeres from the 3-cell stage, but are not detected in the germline blastomeres. This is depedant on PIE-1, indicating it acts as a repressor of differentiated cell fates in the germline blastomeres, through general repression of transcription.9- Staining for an epitope of RNA polymerase II characteristic only when it is active, is not found in germline blastomeres, suggesting the mechanism of transcriptional repression by PIE-1 is to inhibit transcription directly.11 However, since PIE-1 is also found in the cytoplasm, it may play other roles. <enote>Seydoux, G. et al.

Launching the germline in  Caenorhabditis elegans: regulation of gene expression in early germ cells 1999 Development 126:3275-3283 </enote>The role of PIE-1 in the cytoplasm has been suggested as ensuring efficient expression of NOS-2. nos-2 is also a maternal effect gene. Its mRNA is degraded in somatic blastomeres, while being maintained in germline blastomeres, and it is involved in ensuring the primordial germ cells associate with the somatic gonad. PIE-1 is required to maintain nos-2, and several other maternal mRNAs in the germline. PIE-1 is also implicated in functioning to promote NOS-2 protein expression.12 The dual functioning of PIE-1 can be seen in figure 6. <enote>Tenenhaus, C., Subramaniam, K., Dunn, M. A. and Seydoux, G. PIE-1 is a bifunction protein that regulates maternal and zygotic gene expression in the embryonic germ line of  Caenorhabditic elegans 2003  Genes and Development 15:1031-1040 </enote><figure/>As discussed in section 3, mex-1 mutants produce excess pharyngeal cells, in a SKN-1 dependant manner. In these mutants, all the anterior blastomeres adopt an altered cell fate, and the only change to the posterior blastomeres is failure to produce germ cells, as P blastomeres differentiate into muscle cells. P granules are also gradually lost from the germline, indicating MEX-1 is critical for their correct segregation. Cloning of the mex-1 gene revealed that the structure of MEX-1 is similar to that of PIE-1, in that it contains two zinc finger domains.14 Like PIE-1 it was also found to associate to P granules, however it is a cytoplasmic protein, and does not have a nuclear localisation sequence.14 It appears that MEX-1 is required to restrict PIE-1 activity to the germline, and functions in both somatic and germline differentation.13&  <enote>Mello, C. et al.

The glp-1 and apx-1 genes in cell-cell interactions </heading>The maternal effect gene glp-1 encodes a Notch homologue, GLP-1, which has been identified as vital for two cell-cell interactions that help specify cell fates in early development. Temperature shift experiments show that glp-1 activity is required between the 4- and 12-cell stages, in order for ABp to adopt different fates from ABa. Figure 7 shows the localisation of both glp-1 mRNA and the GLP-1 protein in the early embryo. <enote>Evans, T.C., Crittenden, S. L., Kodotanni, V., Kimble, J. Translational control of maternal  glp-1 mRNA establishes asymmetry in the C.elegans embryo 1994 Cell 77:183-194 </enote><picture/>The expression of the glp-1 mRNA appears to be spatially regulated, as there is asymmetrical localisation of the GLP-1 protein, but not the mRNA in the early stages as seen in figure 7. Indeed it has been found that the 3' UTR of the glp-1 mRNA is required for translational repression, in order to restrict translation to the anterior descendants of the 2- to 28-cell stage embryo.15 Using reporter RNA experiments Evans et al. found that the 3' UTR contained a 125 nucleotide region required to repress translation from the 2- to 4-cell stage, and a 61 nucleotide region required for repression of translation in the P 2 dedendants.15 This combination of temporal and spatial control is required for the correct pattern of GLP-1 expression. The spatial control of GLP-1 expression has been shown to be dependant upon two other maternal effect genes, pos-1 and spn-4. A model for this mechanism of control can be seen in figure 8. <enote>Ogura, K., Kishimoto, N., Mitani, S., Gengyo-Ando, K. and Kohara, Y.

When EMS or P2 is removed by a laser microbeam, the AB blastomeres do not develop normally, suggesting a role for these cells in specifying the AB fates.17 In a wild-type 4-cell stage embryo both ABa and ABp contact EMS, however only ABp contacts P 2. It has been shown that P 2 is required to contact ABp in order for it to adopt a different cell fate to ABa.17 This indicates a signalling occurs between ABp and P 2. This signalling is dependant upon glp-1 and apx-1, in a C. elegans equivalent of the Drosophila Notch system. <enote>Mello, C. C., Draper, B. W. and Priess, J. R.

An inductive interaction in 4-cell stage embryos involves APX-1 expression in the signalling cell 1996  Development 122:1791-1798 Word Count = 2976 </enote>As we have seen GLP-1, the receptor, is localised at the membranes as in figure 7. In a 4-cell stage embryo the mRNA of apx-1, the ligand, is found in all four blastomeres, but the protein is only expressed in P 2 as shown in figure 8. This confirms that P 2 is the signalling cell. The asymmetric APX-1 distribution, despite equal mRNA distribution like GLP-1 implies regulation perhaps by translation control, or protein stability. POS-1 seems to be involved in its regulation of expression.16 The signalling of P 2 to ABp, via APX-1 and GLP-1 means that ABp will adopt different cell fates to ABa. <picture/>As previously discussed EMS contains determinants for autonomous development of pharyngeal and intestinal cell fates. Some ABa descendants also have a pharyngeal cell fate, however these fates do not develop autonomously, but require cell-cell signalling. It is found that pharyngeal induction does not occur if MS is destroyed, indicating that this is the signalling cell.17 This interaction is also dependant upon glp-1, as in glp-1 mutants, no pharyngeal tissue is produced by ABa descendants. Two ABa descendants contact MS, and the signalling event occurs to induce pharyngeal cell fates in these descendants. As in the 4-cell interaction, GLP-1 is the receptor, however in this case APX-1 does not appear to be the ligand, as it is not found in the 12-cell stage signalling cell MS.18 However, the interaction has been reproduced in vitro, and P 2 has been shown as capable of initiating the required response in the ABa descendants. 19 This shows that the identity of the signalling cell or the ligand is not important. It is the stage of development that the ABa descendants are at, and the consequent factors present at this time, that produce the required outcome.19 The ligand involved in this signalling is proposed as embryonically transcribed, since it is dependant on the SKN-1 transcription factor.17&19 <heading>6. Conclusion</heading>In conclusion, maternal effect genes play vital roles in determining the early development of the C. elegans embryo. This is evident from the detrimental effects in the development of an embryo whose mother if mutant in a maternal effect gene. Proteins and mRNAs from maternal effect genes, such as the par genes are present in the early embryo, and cause an asymmetrical first division, and localisation of cell fate determinants. Localised determinants such as those from the skn-1, pie-1 and mex-1 genes, as well as genes involved in early cell-cell signalling such as glp-1 and apx-1, initiate the complex patterns of cell differentiation required to produce a correctly developed C. elegans organism. <heading>7.
