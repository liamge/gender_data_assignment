This Project involves a study of the aerodynamics of a car designed using solidworks and tests its aerodynamic factors and then make informed decisions on the improvements that can be made in the car to improve its aerodynamic performance. <heading>AIM</heading>The Study of aerodynamics aims at reducing the drag force of a body moving in a Fluid. Every Moving Car is acted upon by two types of resisting forces. The resistance to tyre treads motion due to the friction and inertia. It is directly proportional to the mass of the car and the coefficient of friction of the surface The resistance to forward motion due to the viscous force of the air. It is directly proportional to the Frontal area and velocity of the car. Ref:  URL  The Second type of resisting force is what the study of aerodynamics aims to reduce and is called the drag force. Thus when a car moves in air. The air tends to push the car along the direction in which it flows across the car hence impeding its forward motion and also reducing its acceleration. Thus Aerodynamics aims at designing the car such that it offers least resistance to the flow of air across it and reduces the drag force caused due the viscosity of the air. Thus aerodynamic car design improves the economy, Handling, Comfort and hence the Safety of the Car. The influence of the drag force on these various aspects of the Car increases with increasing velocity of the car Note: The Velocities that are discussed about in this report essentially mean the relative velocity between the wind and the Car. <heading>BERNOULLI THEOREM </heading>*For a stream line flow of non viscous and incompressible liquid, the sum of the pressure energy, kinetic energy and potential energy per unit mass is always constant.  FORMULA  We can ignore the potential energy factor in this equation for our measurements in this Project as the changes in this term are insignificant in automotive air flows. This theory does not completely work in most practical cases because all fluids have a measurable viscousity and most liquids are compressible in some cases.But in the case of cars, they would have to travel at record breaking speeds to make the compressibility effects of the fluid to become significant and hence we shall consider air to be incompressible as far as this report is concerned. This implies that the pressure and velocity are inversely proportional in this case. The rise in one will cause a fall in another and the fall in one of them will cause a rise in another. For Implications of Bernoulli theorem in car Aerodynamics, refer to the Appendix <heading>REYNOLD NUMBER</heading>**Experiments show that every flow has a factor called the Reynolds number expressed by the alphabet K, where  FORMULA  The value of the Reynolds Number determines the type pf flow of the fluid. For K = 0 to 2000, Flow is Laminar K = 2000 to 3000, Flow is unstable and it switches between Laminar and Turbulent flow K > 3000, Flow is Turbulent The value of Reynolds Number in the Simulation was of the range of millions and hence the flow was Turbulent. <heading>***MACH NUMBER</heading>The Mach number is the ratio of the velocity of the body to the velocity of sound in the same medium.  FORMULA  The behavior of fluids change when the fluids are compressed and fluids are considered to be incompressible when the mach number is greater than 0.3.The Mach number of cars would generally be much lesser than 0.3 and hence the fluid is considered to be incompressible throughout the study. Since the Mach number of the simulation was lesser than 0.3 all the time. The Flow was considered to be Incompressible. <heading>PITOT TUBE</heading><picture/>Picture Ref:  URL  ****The pitot pipe consists of a tube with a lot of holes drilled around its surface connected to one end of a pressure transducer. The pipe also contains a hole drilled along the axis of the pipe and is connected to the other end of the transducer. The pressure transducer is an instrument used to measure the pressure difference between the two groups of tubes. Since the holes on the outside are perpendicular to the atmosphere, they represent the static pressure of the system and the hole drilled across the axis measures the total pressure of the system which is the value of the constant. Hence these two can be substituted into Bernoulli theorem and the value of dynamic pressure can be obtained. Dividing the dynamic pressure by the density and obtaining its square root gives the value of the fluid's velocity.  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  Thus the Pitot tube is used to measure the velocity of fluid flow. <heading>PROCEDURE</heading>The project on Car Aerodynamics involved designing a car on Solidworks, Putting it in a wind tunnel with a fairly large cross section and length avoiding point contact between them. It was then tested for it's drag force for various relative velocities of 10 - 60 m/s.After the measurements were done, the car was modified on a few aspects for better aerodynamics and put through the same tests again. I chose an Audi TT as my Model for simulation and it was designed fairly to scale The drag forces and drag coefficients were observed to be very high for the original car and it was reduced considerably by making a few improvements in the car. <heading>CHANGES MADE IN THE CAR </heading><heading>1.Reducing Surface Friction drag  Caused due to the friction causing boundary layer separation (Refer Appendix)</heading>The energy lost in the form of friction on the front surface of the car that results in the boundary layer separation tends to cause a drag in the car. It can be minimized by smoothening the surface and avoiding gaps in the surface The original Car had a lot of Sharp edges and Flat front and rear surfaces. This increases the Surface friction drag of the car. Hence the improvements for this factor were made by <list>Cutting an arc through the front and rear surfaces of the car by cutting arcs along the Z axis Top to bottom. This gave the car a curved surface on both the sidesChamfering all the sharp edges of the car.</list><heading>Reducing Pressure Drag by Streamlining</heading>When the air encounters the front surface of the car, it forms a high pressure region as it is a high force of the car over a given area and the pressure drops as it moves to the rear of the car. It also forms a small area of low pressure before the region where the boundary layer reunites called the wake. This causes swirls of air in the area and also attracts the air particles from high pressure areas causing a drag force. <picture/>This figure shows the different regions of pressure around the Car It can be minimized by streamlining and making the surface area of the rear lesser than the surface area of the front. This will also enable the boundary layer to stay on maximum possible part of the car's surface. Minimising Pressure drag involves maintaining attached flow through out the car as far as possible.This can be done by streamlining and by making the surface area of the car as we move from the front to the back. When a drop of water is dropped in air, it takes the form of a tear drop which is fairly streamlined and has a reducing surface area as we move from the hemispherical shape to the conical shape. Thus the shape of a tear drop is found to have the lowest coefficient of drag among all known shapes. The improvements of this factor on the car were made by <list>Making the shape of the car fairly continuous (Streamlining).The arc shape on the back reduced the surface area of the back when compared to the front as curved areas have least surface area compared to flat ones.</list><heading>Optimising Fitness Ratio </heading>Fitness Ratio = Diameter of frontal area / Length of car The Length of the car was initially 4011 mm and the height was 1346 mm.The fitness ratio of a car is the ratio of the car's height to the length. This gave me a fitness ratio of .335.The car has a lowest coefficient of Drag when the Fitness ratio is 0.333.Hence I increased the length of the car to 4031 mm which gave me a new fitness ratio of 0.3339.Thus I found a considerable reduction in the drag coefficient. <picture/><picture/>The above Pictures Show the original design on the right and the improved design on the left with better chamfers, arcs and streamlining. <heading>OBSERVATION AND RESULT DISCUSSION</heading><list>Frontal Area = 1.99 m 2 Density of Air = 1.23 kg/m 3Viscousity of air = 0.000017894 kg/ms</list>The Drag coefficient was found to reducing gradually with velocity while the drag force was found to be increasing with velocity. With increase in velocity, there would be an obvious increase in the Reynolds Number and hence we can arrive at the conclusion that the aerodynamics of the car improves when the air flow gets more turbulent. <figure/><figure/>Refer Appendix for Tables and Values The Blue Lines show the readings of the original design and the pink lines show the readings of the improved design. Thus the improvements made on the car showed significant improvements in the aerodynamic performance of the car.
