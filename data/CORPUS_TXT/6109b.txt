Apollodorus in his speech against Neaira stated 'we have hetairai for pleasure, and pallakai for the daily service of our bodies, but wives for the production of legitimate offspring and to have reliable guardian of our household property." This has given rise to the idea that prostitutes in ancient Greece could be distinguished from each other, and could be clearly identified from legitimate wives. I believe it is possible to identify six types of prostitute, which I deem to have been easily identified in antiquity. One of the challenges in trying to prove the different statuses is that even though it may have been obvious at the time, it does not necessarily mean the primary source material will state it, for people do not tend to divulge information they assume their readers will already know. Two other difficulties are that there are no accounts written by the prostitutes themselves, and the secondary sources have never been consistent in the titles they have given prostitutes. Throughout translations and discussions hetairai and pallake, as well as the other terms including porne and aulētrides, have often been used to refer to all types of prostitutes, so I have had to examine each text to try and define the true meaning, and then apply the correct terminology. <fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.122 </fnote>In my argument the six types of prostitutes are pornai, aulētrides, hetairai, pallakai, temple and males. I will not be analysing temple or males through my discussion. This is because it is unclear whether temple prostitutes truly existed, and if they did, it is likely they occurred outside of Greece. McClure states that the arguments for them 'at Corinth have largely relied on Athenaeus' misreading of classical sources, particularly Pindar'. The males can not be distinguished from the Athenian citizen in the same way as the females, so I would therefore have needed to treat both these types as different entities, which is outside the scope of the project. <fnote>McClure 2003:140 </fnote>To determine the different roles I will assess the experience the four prostitutes had in relation to their origins, living conditions, working conditions, welfare, relationships with men and education. To evaluate these areas I will discuss the primary source material including plays, oratory and laws, as well as secondary criticism on these matters. <heading>1. Background Argument</heading>Before discussing the varying roles I will point out the basic arguments for and against classifying prostitutes into different status groups. Hamel argued prostitutes 'came in a variety of types, not neatly demarcated from one another'. A number of scholars argue the only variant is legitimate 'Wives and the Rest' and Davidson encapsulates this stance: <fnote>Hamel 2003:4 </fnote><fnote>Keuls cited in Davidson 1998:75 </fnote><quote>'Despite the numerous ancient definitions, attempts to establish clear demarcations between the different categories of women in Athens...are highly problematic and consensus rarely survives for more than a generation.'</quote><fnote>Davidson 1998:74 </fnote>The issue should not be avoided purely on the basis that it is difficult and I feel connotations of prostitution have meant scholars have avoided discussing it in depth. Despite the nature of the prostitution profession, it should be researched to enable us to have a true sense of what life in ancient Greece was like. 'Prostitutes were taxed by the state in Athens, so...buying sex from prostitutes, then, was sanctioned by law', and all men would have had paid for sexual relations at some time. The relationship would have differed depending on whether the female was hired for one sexual encounter or a long-term relationship where sex was provided, but was not all that was desired. <fnote>Davidson 1998:78 agrees 'this dogmatic distinction is a way for scholars to avoid dealing with prostitution altogether'. </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:13 </fnote>Scholars continue to argue against the view that prostitutes differed in antiquity and believe the speech of Apollodorus was 'no more than a rhetorical flourish', and that too much emphasis has been placed on the differences. This would lead to the similarities being overlooked. All prostitutes would have been expected to have sex with whoever paid them, were available for 'temporary hire or straightforward seduction', the law forbade them from having legitimate children and all were looked down upon. Prostitution was legal, even when the men were married. There was criticism shown towards a man who 'visited prostitutes too frequently and squandered his inheritance on his pursuit of physical pleasures [and] might be despised for his lack of self-control'. This could lead scholars to believe it is not necessary to separate the different types, because they all performed the same activities and were regarded in the same manner; as objects of desire for men to enjoy but without the status of the legitimate wife. <fnote>Just 1994:52 </fnote><fnote>Dover 1974:210 cited in Just 1994:138 </fnote><fnote>Plutarch.Pericles.37 </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:13 </fnote>I do not feel this is a strong enough argument to rule out the different types. All women, whether they were legitimate wives, slaves or prostitutes were second class citizens to men but this did not mean they were the same. In agreement Davidson notes it would be 'as absurd to generalise about them as it is to about their clients'. The men are all clients of prostitutes but this does not mean that their statuses were all the same. <fnote>Davidson 1998:107 </fnote>Another reason that I believe the pallake had a greater status than the other prostitutes is that there are a few examples of a porne becoming a hetaira, and a hetaira becoming a pallake but the reverse never occurred. Neaira was a porne and became a hetaira and 'Aristophanes...reminds Myrtilus that old age frequently reduces once elusive, beautiful courtesans, such as Lais II, to the status of a brothel slave'. The female in On the Stepmother was so desperate to remain a pallake that she poisoned her partner, believing it to be a love potion. The status of the hetaira and pallake, therefore, had to be greater than that of the porne. <fnote>McClure 2003:48 citing Aristophanes.Acharnians.570c-d </fnote><fnote>Antiphon.1.On the Stepmother.16 'she agreed, without hesitation'. </fnote><heading>2. Origins </heading>The origins of the prostitutes, which can be shown through their appearance and place within society, can reveal their status, particularly when contrasted to the legitimate wife. <heading>2.1 Pornai</heading>I believe that the pornai were the street girls that worked on the street corners, enticing men with studs on their shoes that said 'akolouthei' (follow me). There were also pornai that worked in brothels and would have been the property of a pimp. Whether they worked inside the brothel or on the street corners they were the furthest from the legitimate wives. I believe they would have been foreign and came from cities outside of Greece, as I have found no examples to prove otherwise, whereas 'the women who inhabited these corridors [in building Z, an excavated brothel in Ceramicus] were foreigners, almost certainly slaves, who left traces of their devotion to foreign goddesses in the form of little statuettes. These...suggest they had come from Thrace, Anatolia, and Syria." These girls were of the lowest status in society and it is likely they were forced into the profession, as they were slaves from 'barbarian' areas which were typically non-Greek speaking.  <fnote>Hamel 2003:5 </fnote><fnote>Smith (2006) 'Ceramicus ran diagonally through the Agora, entering it through the valley between the Pnyx and the Areopagus' </fnote><fnote>Davidson 1998:86 </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:5 </fnote><heading>2.2 Aulētrides</heading>I feel that the aulētrides were also despised but their status could be greater then the porne. They either worked outside on the streets, where they could be immediately contrasted to the legitimate wives who remained indoors, or appeared at the symposium. This was an indoor event where the aulētrides would perform with musical instruments and/or dancing. Legitimate wives would not have attended, as it meant interacting with non-related males. Unlike the pornai, aulētrides appear to have originated from Greek cities. Xenophon's Symposium includes an aulētride from a Greek city, Olynthias, conquered by Philip of Macedon. The women from this city would have been killed or taken as slaves, and so a number of them would have been forced into a life of prostitution. It is disturbing how the men appear to have forgotten the aulētris' former life as a legitimate citizen, albeit from a foreign state, and treat her as a mere slave. Theopompus catalogued the priceless treasures made to lovers at Delphi, included an offering 'to Pharsalia, the dancing girl from Thessaly'. It can be argued they tended to be attractive, as men fought over them. Figure eight may depict a fight over an aulētris, as the boy in the background appears to have been beaten, and the girl is kissing the champion's hand. This fighting may not have been unique to aulētrides however, as Demosthenes commented on how fighting over hetaira was common practice and to an extent accepted; <fnote>Theopompus FGR Hist 115 F248 cited in Davidson 1998:122 unable to use original text as only available in German </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:32 </fnote><quote>'there are many in the city, sons of respectable men... [who] received blows over an hetaira; and that's the way young men behave' </quote><fnote>Demosthenes.54.Against Conon.14 </fnote>Lysias says how 'extraordinary, indeed, it would be, if in all cases of wounds received...in a fight for a hetaira...you are to inflict a punishment of such awful severity." The terminology is interesting in these texts. Although the primary sources state hetaira, I feel that the circumstances, particularly described by Lysias, seem more suited to an aulētris. The fighting on the streets and drunkenness described indicate the passage is in reference to youths, and they were more likely to pick a girl up from the streets who were either a porne or aulētris. The speeches are however, trying to show that these fights were a normal part of life and they have wanted to make the girls seem more respectable, so therefore refer to them as 'hetaira', as these prostitutes had a higher status, as I will highlight later. <fnote>Lysias.3.Simon.43 </fnote><fnote>McClure 2003:11 states that 'hetaira is a more euphemistic term.' </fnote>Although citizens may have felt it an acceptable event, the Astynomoi had to settle the disputes peacefully and set a maximum fee of two drachmas to ensure the fighting was controlled.  <fnote>The Astynomoi were a board of men who were responsible for keeping the highways clear. </fnote><fnote>Aristotle.Constitution.50.2 </fnote><quote>'There are ten city commissioner...they see that the girls who play the flute, the harp or the lyre are not hired for more than two drachmae; if more then one man wishes to hire the same performer, they cast lots and allocate her to the winner. '</quote><fnote>Aristotle.Constitution.50.2 </fnote>A set price would have ensured that the transaction of the girl could be carried off swiftly and the men would not try and bid for her. If two men wanted the same aulētris, they were drawn by lot, and she had no role in the decision making process.  <fnote>Davidson 1998:82 </fnote>There is little evidence that pornai or auletrides became pallakai, so it is likely they would have continued the profession into old age. Pallake were not legitimate wives but lived with their partner in his home, and had sexual relations with him. It may have been difficult for Athenian men to accept pornai and aulētrides into their homes. This is revealed by Habroton, an auletris that was taken on by Charisos, who had left his wife after finding she had had a baby, which he incorrectly assumed was not his. Charisos did not even attempt to make Habroton into a replacement wife, and Smikrines implies her profession meant she could never take the place of an Athenian. Although this is a play it reveals how Athenians generally felt towards the aulētrides, for although they were available for sex they never fulfilled the role required of a legitimate wife. <fnote>MacDowell, 1986:89 </fnote><fnote>Menander. Arbitration.143 </fnote><heading>2.3 Hetairai</heading>The hetairai were the wealthiest of the prostitutes and worked from their own homes. I believe they would have been foreign and non-Athenian as Phryne was from Boeotian Thespiae, Lais II was from Hyccara and Rhodopis was from Thrace. Although some, like Rhodopis were slaves, Theodote may be an example of how a hetaira could be free-born. Xenophon describes how she is with her mother. This woman could be posing as her mother, as Nikarete did towards the girls she owned, which would imply Theodote was a slave. The text suggests otherwise as Xenophon states they go to her house, implying she is in charge of her finances and her mother resides with her. She may have been a slave when she was younger and brought her freedom, but the presence of her mother suggests she was free born. There is no evidence to suggest that parents would have prostituted their daughters, however, there was a law stating that parents were not to prostitute their sons, so it was not an implausible idea to the ancient Greeks. I suggest that Theodote had not been a victim of exposure or prostitution, and think she was a free, non-Athenian who through necessity or choice became a hetaira. <fnote>McClure 2003:127 </fnote><fnote>McClure 2003:55 </fnote><fnote>Herodotus 2.134 </fnote><fnote>Herodotus 2.134 slave of Iadman </fnote><fnote>Xenophon. Memorabila.3.11.4 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.19 </fnote><fnote>Aeschines.1.Against Timarchus. 13 </fnote><heading>2.4 Neaira </heading>The hetairai's appearance increased their status and they were the celebrities of Greece. Laïs 'was one of the most beautiful women of the age' and is mentioned in The Huntress. Nikarete 'reportedly had a knack for spotting potential in young girls' and her girls were among the most famous in Athens, and of the seven, Phila, Isthmias and Neaira were mentioned by Athenaeus. Neaira is particularly well known due to the Speech Against Neaira, in which Apollodorus attacked her on the grounds she was a foreigner and a prostitute, that had been attempting to pass herself off as a 'respectable' woman. The speech illustrates how a prostitute could experience the different statuses, how difficult it can be to determine the type of prostitute a girl was, and how the types were viewed. It is particularly interesting as Apollodorus never refers to Neaira as a type of prostitute, only that she hired out her body and was owned by Nikarete. Hamel believes Neaira began prostitution at twelve or thirteen, but I think she may have been younger as Nikarete would have wanted the girls earning as soon as they reached puberty. Apollodorus reveals Neaira was a porne; she was the property of Nikarete, and as such had no control over her finances or lovers. I believe she was better off then a lot of pornai as she was very attractive and was presented as the daughter of a free woman. To increase their desirability Nikarete told her clients the girls were her daughters. As 'free' women they would have been worth more money than slaves. Carey also reveals this charade was beneficial as Nikarete could demand higher fees on the basis 'the girls were ruining their marriage prospects, especially when dealing with strangers, since she could represent the girls as virgins.'  <fnote>Barrett and Sommmerstein 1978:331 </fnote><fnote>Athenaeus.Deipnosophists. 13.13.587e.

She had no control over her lovers, and gained no financial benefit. She was able to buy her freedom when they no longer required her due to her unusual circumstances when owned by Nikarete. Neaira developed close relationships, in the same way that a heatira would, and so could call on her clientele for help. The majority of pornai had one off encounters with their clients, so would have been unable to turn to them for support but Nikarete had developed long term relationships with her girls and clients, probably because she only had seven girls, making it a better way to secure their income. In larger brothels it would be beneficial to have a number of men using the establishment, and it would therefore be unnecessary to develop longer relationships. <fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.29 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.19 </fnote>Phrynion contributed a large sum and Neaira became his pallake, as she moved into his home, although he used her like a porne, 'treating her without decency or restraint', giving her justifiable grounds to leave. This emphasises how a pallake's status was superior to that of the porne, as once Neaira had entered this new lifestyle, she expected to be treated with greater respect, a fact appreciated by men. She then became the pallake of Stephanos. The fundamental difference between a hetaira and pallake is the housing arrangement. Theodote is a hetaira because men visit her in her home; Neaira is Stephanos' pallake because she moves in with him. Although she may have moved in with Timanoridas and Eucrates, it was not an exclusive relationship with one man, so she can not be classed as a pallake. As she was their slave she could be classed as a porne. She had no choice over living with them and had no control over her finances. Yet she was like a hetaira as she only had two lovers, and had the means to buy her freedom, a factor that will be discussed later. This highlights the difficulty of defining the statuses of prostitutes. Although Neaira was a prostitute for Timanoridas and Eucrates, her position is not clear. She can be defined as a porne or a hetaira, for which pro and counter arguments can be efficiently made for each situation. It is such complications that have highlighted how the gradations can be blurred but I feel that there is still a spectrum that each type can be placed onto, as Neaira's status, regardless of what she is referred to, does increase. It is the terminology that causes the greatest difficulty when trying to argue for the different statuses. <fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.30 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.33 </fnote><heading>2.5 Pallakai</heading>According to Apollodorus, the status of the pallake enabled Neaira to imitate the life of a citizen wife, revealing how similar the worlds of the wife and pallake could be. Both women resided with their partners, and it may not have been clear that Neaira was not an Athenian. It was the responsibility of the husband to make this distinction, by not presenting any of his children born by his pallake as legitimate. Apollodorus argues Stephanos treated her as legitimate by introducing her sons into the phantry and when they were eighteen, 'had their names inscribed on his deme's population register'. He also married Neaira's daughter, Phano, off twice and she acted as the basilinna at the state's religious festival. What Apollodorus states may be true but it would have only been illegal for Stephanos to have acted in this way if Neaira were the mother. There are a couple of reasons to suggest this wasn't the case and the offspring were Stephanos' from his previous marriage. Apollodorus gives no time frame that Neaira could have had these children. When she was the property of Nikarete, Timanoridas and Eukrates, she would probably have avoided becoming pregnant, as it would have lowered her value. 'A working girl's income depended on the maintenance of her appearance' and this would have been vital to Nikarete when she was presenting the girls as virgins. Timanoridas and Eukrates had brought her for sexual services and I doubt they would have allowed for her to become pregnant and spoil her figure. There is also evidence to suggest prostitutes knew how to prevent or terminate unwanted pregnancies. Riddle believes all 'their knowledge was primarily transmitted by a network of women' and was not always passed onto males. A Hippocratic writer, however, commented on how he assisted a prostitute in aborting her child, suggesting prostitutes did not have an intrinsic knowledge. <fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.38 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59 .Against Neaira.38 </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:50 </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:48 </fnote><fnote>Riddle 1992.16 </fnote><quote>'I came to see a six-day-old embryo.

'</quote><fnote>Nat.Puer. 13 </fnote>This implies even prostitutes needed men to assist them. There are a few problems, however, with this text. The 'six-day-old-embryo' is said to have looked like a 'raw egg' and when it fell out of the aulētride, she was not in pain but merely 'surprised'! I do not believe that the man truly witnessed the scene, making it difficult to know if he made the story up to make out women relied on men for medical knowledge, or exaggerated the facts to make it an exciting story. I stand by the idea that prostitutes would have known ways to perform abortions because it was vital such girls did not end up in this situation and risk losing their value. It was not information the prostitutes would have divulged with their clients; as the men would have had no use for such information, as they would have wanted their wives to become pregnant. They would not have gone to a Hippocratic doctor as the pornai and aulētrides would have been unlikely to have afforded it, and the doctors took an oath to state they would not perform this act. <fnote>Nat.Puer. 13 </fnote><fnote>Hippocratic Oath 'Neither will I give a woman means to procure an abortion'. </fnote>In regards to Phano taking part in the festival as the basilinna, Apollodorus suggests the problem was not that she was an alien, but because she had had sex. The girl offered to Dionysus was required, by law, to have been a virgin before she became the wife of the archon basileus. As Phano had been in a previous marriage, and given birth to a child, she was not suitable for the position but this does not prove she was the daughter of Neaira. <fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.75 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.51 and 56 </fnote>It is possible that Neaira had never been a prostitute of any form and it was a mere fiction created by Apollodorus, to enable him to attack Stephanos. This could be true as prostitutes have often been used to insult men. In Wasps, Aristophanes comments on the politician Cleon and prostitute Cynna, <quote>'Old Jagged Teeth him- Self, whose eyes like the bitch Cynna's flashed terrible Beams,'</quote><fnote>Aristophanes.Wasps. 32-34 </fnote>I believe Neaira was a prostitute, as she had been mentioned in plays, implying she was a well known figure and not merely someone invented by Apollodorus. <fnote>Athenaeus.Deipnosophists.13.587e </fnote>It is unlikely Stephanos would have risked his home and livelihood to accept her children as legitimate, so I believe they had been from his previous marriage. Regardless of the outcome, the speech illustrates how different the life of a prostitute could be depending on her status. It also shows how, although the pallakai's status was greater than the pornai and aulētrides, they still differed significantly to the legitimate wife. Apollodorus refers to Neaira by name 'more than fifty times'. 'Reputable women were very rarely mentioned by name in Athenian courtrooms. Instead they were identified by their relationships to male relatives'.  <fnote>Hamel 2003:28 </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:28 </fnote><heading>2.6 Aspasia</heading>It is difficult to assess whether all pallakai had previously been a hetaira, aulētride or porne. I believe some would have been sexual entertainers. This can be argued on the basis that the symposia, pimps and brothels offered the best opportunity for men to meet those of the opposite sex. Of those pallakai that had been prostitutes, it is likely the majority had been hetairai, as they had the greatest opportunity to communicate with their clients, as they spent more time with the men in activities other than sex. Laïs was a hetaira but later on in her career took up the position of a pallake. Some may have been free alien women that had no part in the prostitution profession. The most famous pallake, Aspasia, illustrates the difficulty of assessing their previous life. Aspasia is usually termed a hetaira due to her independence, intellect and prominence in society. This shows how the terminology applied by a scholar in translations can complicate the argument in defining the status of prostitutes. Depending on how a scholar defined a hetaira would affect the way they termed the females in the texts. McClure stated Aspasia was a pallake, Just a courtesan and Brainard a hetaira; this can obviously lead to confusion. <fnote>Lysias.1.On the murder of Eratoshenes: defence.8 Euphiletus states his wife is only able to come into contact with males at a public event, such as a funeral. </fnote><fnote>Neaira became the pallake of Stephanos (Dem.59.16 she was 'living as his wife') and Lais was the pallake of Philonides (Barrett and Sommerstein 1978:331). </fnote><fnote>McClure 2003:235 </fnote><fnote>Just 1994:9 </fnote><fnote>Brainard (11.07.05) </fnote>Plutarch compared her to Thargelia, who 'had many lovers' so could be labelled a hetaira, as a pallake would have had one partner. It is possible Thargelia was not with her lovers at the same time, and if she shared a home with each one she may have been a pallake. Plato implies Aspasia is a hetaira, stating she has 'made many other people [into] good orators'. Henry explains this could reveal she had a number of sexual partners, as she was assisting Pericles in his oratory skills, whilst have a sexual affair with him. It could be supposed that whilst teaching men oratory, she acted as their hetaira. I do not agree. Hetairai were given information from men at symposia and this was a privilege they gained in exchange for their sexual services. Henry states Aspasia dispensed the information on philosophy and taught men how to become orators, so the positions have reversed. The men are not providing Aspasia with anything, so she would not have been obliged to provide them with her sexual services. I therefore disagree with Henry that she had many sexual partners. <fnote>Plutarch.Pericles.24.3 </fnote><fnote>Plato.Menexenus.235e5 </fnote><fnote>Henry 1995:35 </fnote>Like Neaira, it could be argued the use of Aspasia's name proves she had been a porne. Powell disagrees believing it was a means of coping with her prominence. Aspasia had what most women were denied; independence, the ability to converse with the leading men as well as educate them in their oratorical development and the right to choose her lovers. To ensure she still had a lower status then her male counterparts, her name was used to reduce her status to that of a hetaira. There is not necessarily any truth behind this. Men in Classical Athens wanted females to remain in their subordinate roles. The Amazon myths illustrated how awful the world would be if females were in control and showed how men needed to regain their status as leaders. Aristotle highlighted how awful it would be for females to gain a higher position in society in his discussion on Spartan women. Men would therefore not want a woman like Aspasia gaining prominence and revealing to other women that they could interact on an intellectual level with males and gain a more affluent position in society. They therefore placed her in the realms of a prostitute, a position that the legitimate wife would not have related to. <fnote>Powell 1995:267 </fnote><fnote>Aristotle.The Politics. 2.1269b - 2.1270a </fnote>It can also be argued that she was a pallake as she 'was not called a porne...in the comic sources until late in the fifth century'. Cratinus referred to her as a 'dog-eyed concubine'. This is negative but reveals Aspasia was viewed to be the pallake of Pericles, a Hera to his Zeus. Henry feels this shows the 'actual type of marriage Aspasia had with Pericles', and I think the negative feeling at the time was aimed at her not being legitimate wife, rather than a porne or hetaira. Powell believes it unlikely she had been a prostitute, as to be 'sexually promiscuous, before or during her time with Pericles...might have made it impossible for her son, even by Pericles, to be admitted by special decree to citizenship'. Pomeroy questioned her relationship with Pericles as 'he does not seem to have made any arrangements for her future after his death', and the children from his previous marriage had died. Yet Aspasia was only his pallake, and therefore did not have the rights automatically given to a legitimate wife. His wealth and accommodation would have been passed to a relative of his, not to a non-Athenian female. It could also be argued that their relationship had broken down, as soon after his death she is reported to have had a relationship with Lysicles. This may have been her only means of support and may not have a reflection on the relationship with Pericles. It is difficult to know the truth. <fnote>Henry 1995: 138 note 9 </fnote><fnote>Cheirons frag 259 cited in Henry 1995:20 </fnote><fnote>Henry 1995:21 </fnote><fnote>Powell 1995:267 </fnote><fnote>Pomeroy 1996:684 </fnote><fnote>Henry 1995:16 </fnote>Through the marriage-like relationship, the pallake had the closest status to the legitimate wife but was unable to produce legitimate children, ensuring the wife remained preferable over foreign, non-Athenian women. On the Stepmother also reveals how pallakai were never completely trusted, as she was easily persuaded by the stepmother and 'even though she was not to blame, she was tortured on the wheel' and then executed; a death the prosecutor felt she deserved.  <fnote>Plutarch.Pericles.37 </fnote><fnote>Antiphon.1.On the Stepmother.16 </fnote><fnote>Antiphon.1.On the Stepmother.20 </fnote><heading>3. Living Conditions</heading>To analyse the living conditions I have decided to look at the following three areas; money, housing arrangements and the dress of the prostitutes <heading>3.1 Money</heading>The pornai earned the lowest wage and were paid per sexual act, ranging from one obol to one drachma. Money personified them; they were referred to as 'tuppenny sluts of scummy slavelings', 'Obole' and 'Didrachmon'. Their earnings were reduced if they worked in a brothel, as the pornoboskos (the brothel owner) would take a percentage. They had to register to be prostitutes and pay tax. Their income was not guaranteed, making money of even greater importance for these women. It is likely they would have treated richer men more favourably as in Aristophanes' Wealth, Chremylus remarks 'that in Corinth the tarts there, when a customer comes in who's poor, they just ignore him, but a rich man gets instant admission - even by the back entrance!" This emphasises that porne were known for doing anything required of them in order to receive the highest wage. There were also pornai, such as Nikarete's girls, that received gifts. Lysias initiated Mateneira into the Mysteries as she gained nothing from the other items he gave her, as they were taken by Nikarete.

Hamel argues 'some aulētrides, at least were probably able at times to bring home more than the top price allowed by the law' but Hyperides reveals the penalties for such actions. <fnote>Menander.Samia. 393 </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:12 </fnote><quote>'It is Diognides and Antidoros the metic who are now impeached, accused of hiring out girl pipers for more than the law prescribes'. </quote><fnote>Hyperides.Defence of Euxenippos. 3 </fnote>Sexual services may not have been included in the two drachmas. If men did not have to pay more than a set amount, it seems unlikely they would risk being penalised to do so. The evidence is unclear and is difficult to know how much an aulētride earned, but I feel they were not much better off then the pornai, due to being controlled by the astynomoi. <fnote>Hamel 2003.12 </fnote>The hetaira's relationships with their clients were more complex, as they gained more money, and received gifts. From the sixth century 'we hear of and find evidence for the rich and successful hetaira'. They acted as an escort, having long term relationships and Theodote is an example of a rich hetaira, who controlled her own finances. She owned her house and was beautiful, so in greater demand, which meant she could request a better fee. Once a hetaira had developed a relationship with a client, it could also ensure security, of which the pornai and aulētrides were deprived. There was an element of difficulty as the hetaira was meant to appear as though she was willing to do something for nothing, so her income may not have always been guaranteed. In the long term this element ensured she was provided with better gifts, as the clients could believe their hetaira felt true affection. <fnote>Cameron and Kuhrt 1993:97 </fnote>The hetaira was given the means to buy their freedom. This was possible as they would contract 'a loan from a benefit club sometimes composed of past clients'. This is shown by Neaira. They would repay the loan by becoming the pallake of the main provider, like Neaira and Phrynion, or through their 'earnings as a free prostitute'. A porne who was owned by a pornoboskos, or an aulētris that did not develop long term relationships with her clients, would have been less likely to have purchased her freedom. <fnote>Pomeroy 1975:89 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.30 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.33 </fnote><fnote>Pomeroy 1975:89 </fnote>The hetairai could become so wealthy, that they paid to have monuments put up. According to Callistratus, Phryne rebuilt the walls of the city of Thebes and left an inscription on the monument stating 'Alexander may have knocked it down, but Phryne the hetaira got it back up again'. Interestingly, this was one of the few times the hetaira labelled themselves. I feel that the hetaira would have wanted to pretend to not be a hetaira until they had, like Phyrne, earned enough money to support themselves without the aid of a man. At this point it would not be a problem if the clients became aware that their relationships were based on money, not affection. <fnote>Davidson 1998:106 </fnote><fnote>Davidson 1998:106 </fnote>The level of independence and financial gain for the hetaira was not a definite, even if you were beautiful. 'Epicrates illustrates the decline of the hetaira, Lais, when he contrasts the period of her prime, when starters (two drachmas) made her wild with rage, and her current decrepitude, when she accepts even a triobol (half-drachma) with meekness and mildness'. The hetaira's appearance and money went hand in hand and when no longer considered to be beautiful, they earned as little as the porne and aulētrides that they had separated themselves from. <fnote>Davidson 1998:119 </fnote>Neaira illustrates the difficulty in ensuring you always had a stable income, as through the war she was unable to support her 'extravagant' lifestyle. Her profession as a hetaira would have added an extra strain, as she had to appear like she did not need the support of a man. If she was unable to uphold this appearance her status would be reduced and her earnings would have decreased. <fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira 36 </fnote>The pallake had the added security of living with a man, and Just argues the relationship would have 'essentially [been] a mercenary one'. This would imply they were supported financially and similar to the hetaira, except there was only one man they had to satisfy. Sparkes believes the relationship was created through payments, so 'was obviously more expensive than one-night stands and was the privilege of the wealthy'. I feel this could prove the pallake had to be of the most beautiful and desirable women as they cost a great deal. Yet I do not believe it was only the wealthy that had pallake; any metics that became the partners of Athenian citizens would have had the status, because they could not be regarded as legitimate wives. We only know about the pallake of the wealthiest men, like Pericles, because they were famous. <fnote>Just 1994:147 and cites Dover 1974:210 and Pomeroy 1975:91 for being in agreement. </fnote><fnote>Sparkes 1998:253 </fnote><heading>3.2 Housing</heading>In regards to housing, brothels were 'despised and feared'. Building Z had fifteen rooms, but it is difficult to assess how many women would have resided in them and how cramped the conditions would have been. As the pornoboskos used pornai for financial means, it is likely they would have tried to have as many as possible, but there is no evidence to back up my assumption. The brothels were situated in the less desirable parts of Athens. The porne occupied 'the places where bathmen poured the effluent of public baths, where those who needed to may take a casual crap, where the city buried its dead'. The home of the pornai would have had negative connotations and it is clear from this description why their lives were despised. Indeed Artemidorus said 'I know someone who dreamed that he entered a whore house and was unable to leave. He died a few days afterwards, as was the logical result of his dream." The brothels were a place to have sex but were situated in areas that reminded a person of the less pleasant elements of human life. This could reinforce the idea of why men had such short relationships with the pornai, as they would not want to be a part of these areas for too great a time. The negative elements are revealed in Aristophanes Knights, where he criticises Cleon; <fnote>Davidson 1998:83 </fnote><fnote>Davidson 1998:85 </fnote><fnote>Davidson 1998:83 </fnote><fnote>Artemidorus 1.78 cited in Davidson 1998:83 </fnote><quote>Sausage seller : get drunk, argue with the tarts, an' 'ave used bathwater to drink! Thepeople : Good idea. Having shouting contests with the tarts and the bath attendants, that's just about his level.' </quote><fnote>Aristophanes.Knights. lines 1397-1402 </fnote>The aulētrides could have been viewed as better off as Polybius commented <quote>'are not the most splendid houses there those which go by the names of Murtium, Mnesis, and Pothine? And yet Mnesis was an aulētris, as was Pothine, and Murtium was a public prostitute.'</quote><fnote>Polybius.Histories.14.11 </fnote>However this is referring to the Alexandria in Egypt, and I believe it is likely that in Athens, the aulētrides lived in the same space as the porne. In regards to hetairai, Theodote's house was 'lavishly appointed in all other respects' and the pallake would have lived in the homes of their partners. <fnote>Davidson 1998:82 </fnote><fnote>Xenophon.Memorabilia.3.11.4 </fnote><heading>3.3 Dress</heading>The dress of the prostitutes could reveal their status. Hamel states the porne would have had their faces painted but McClure argues this would have been the case for all prostitutes. All women had the opportunity to wear make up but it was desired for the legitimate wife to avoid it as could lead to them being associated with prostitutes. Interestingly Cynulcus felt the porne were higher in status than the hetaira as they did not try to conceal themselves with make-up but stood naked. The hetaira, like Theodote, wore make up and jewellery to attract men and make their status greater. The wives would not need to do this. The porne's dress would not have been like the hetaira. They would stand naked or nearly naked whilst on display to their clients. McClure argues that this is supported by Theodote who conceals elements to her clients, showing 'only as much as decency allows'. I do not agree as Theodote has had a number of clients, so it is clearly ideal for women to not reveal all their commodities straight away. The men had to wait to see Theodote, making her far more desirable than the porne who were cheaper and easily accessible. <fnote>Hamel 2003:5 </fnote><fnote>Xenophon.Oeconomicus. 10.7 'Don't think... I enjoy the colour of white lead more than the colour o your own skin.' </fnote><fnote>Philemon Adelphoi F3 KA=569e-f cited in McClure 2003:113 'the women stand naked that you not be deceived'. </fnote><fnote>McClure 2003:113 </fnote><fnote>Xenophon.Memorabilia.3.11.1 </fnote>The living conditions can therefore reveal how the statuses of the prostitutes differed. The porne had the lowest status as they earned the least amount of money, the brothels they resided in were despised and they were considered to be the cheapest. In contrast the hetaira earned the most, being in a position to put up monuments, and the pallake had the financial security of living with a man. <heading>4. Working condition</heading>The working conditions of the pornai appear to be difficult and, as already mentioned, they had a number of clients, for whom they would have had to provide a quick service. There are images to suggest when a pornai, working in a brothel, was not providing sexual gratification; they would be required to spin wool. There are different opinions on this matter; Keuls feels the spindles could have been a prop for an exotic fetish, so the pornai could appear to be like legitimate wives. In an establishment such as Nikarete's (although Apollodorus does not imply this was the case) this could have made sense as it would have backed up the charade the girls were free born daughters, doing domestic chores in their home. Other scholars feel this was the type of women men were trying to escape from. I do not agree with either view. The girls are not trying to mimic wives but are being made to work whilst they are not occupied with a man; 'a greedy slave-owner did not need to let his slaves sit idle while they waited for night to fall." This is best shown through the quote of a tired porne who complains 'but I have had it up three times already in this short time', although it could also be a pun regarding being with a client, and may not reflect wool work. I do not believe men were trying to escape from legitimate wives, prostitutes were an ideal choice as to bed another man's wife could result in death, and men were only supposed to have sexual intercourse with their wives for the procreation of children. As prostitutes were an accepted part of ancient Greek culture, they were an added feature to the marriage, not necessarily a replacement. Ischomachus believed the wives were preferable for sexual stimulation, because 'the wife gratifies her husband voluntarily, but the slave girl is forced to acquiesce." The prostitute, especially the porne owned by a pornoboskos, had no choice, like the slave. <fnote>Keuls cited by Davidson 1998:87 </fnote><fnote>Davidson 1998:88 </fnote><fnote>Davidson 1998:88 </fnote><fnote>Lysias.1.On the murder of Eratoshenes: defence. 25f </fnote><fnote>Xenophon.Oeconomicus. 10.12 </fnote>The aulētrides at symposiums entertained with instruments and/or dancing. The two elements were so interlinked that Kilmer believed the 'flute-girl has a reputation as a sexual as well as a musical entertainer'. The aulētrides needed to be excellent entertainers, as Xenophon suggests; 'a good aulos player, and a dancing girl who was one of the top stunte-artistes' appeared at the Symposia. <fnote>Kilmer 1993:125 </fnote><fnote>Xenophon.Symposium.2.1 </fnote>The high earning hetaira, as already discussed, did not have the stability of a pallake or wife. Like Theodote, they had to play different lovers against each other. This may have been a difficult working condition as they had to be constantly pleasing, and Theodote was putting on a show, trying to be desirable to all men, which could be seen as a difficult aspect to uphold. In Athinas it is clear a 'hetaira [is] better-natured than a wife? Certainly, and fittingly so, because a wife, with the laws protection, stays haughtily at home, but a hetaira knows that she obtains her lover with a nice manner, or else she must go find another'. <fnote>Amphis' (Athanas) 13.559a9-b3 cited in Henry 1992:262 </fnote>If Apollodorus were to be believed, which is something I would be sceptical about, in becoming Stephanos' pallake Neaira was expected to be his mistress, as well as being desirable to other men, so she could provide an income. A hetaira may never have had the opportunity to just be with one man, as a wife or pallake could be. <fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira. 39 </fnote>The pallakai, like the pornai, were required to perform domestic chores and still expected to take on feminine roles. Aspasia had to entertain and teach a number of people, as 'Socrates, in fact, came to see her with his disciples, and his friends brought their wives to hear her'. She was never able to stop working, and had to be available for men and women to discuss matters with. <fnote>Pomeroy 1975:144 </fnote><fnote>Plutarch.Pericles. 24.3 </fnote><heading>5. Welfare</heading>The welfare reveals how the prostitutes were protected by laws and their clients, and the security they had within society. <heading>5.1 Protection from the law</heading>The porne 'enjoyed certain legal safeguards'. For those on the streets the safeguards are not clear, but in a brothel they were owned by their pornoboskos, and therefore were protected like a slave, and could not be stolen or maltreated by their clients. Any children they had would have been kept by the pornoboskos and he had the right to abuse them physically and sexually. Most pornoboskos were men and may have had sex with their pornai. <fnote>Sparkes 1998:253 </fnote>As already stated aulētrides were safeguarded by the astonomoi who prevented men fighting over the women. Dover believes the girl's that appeared at symposium could have been 'mauled or importuned in a manner which might have cost a man his life if he attempted it with a woman of citizen status'. I believe that this could have happened to those living on the streets once they were purchased, as there were no laws to protect women of alien and slave status, so once the astonomoi had sold them to a client, the men could treat them however they wished. <fnote>Dover 2002:23 </fnote>All prostitutes would have been disadvantaged in comparison to wives as they were not protected by law nor had the economic security of a dowry. The pallake were protected by the Drakon law; <fnote>Pomeroy 1975:91 </fnote><quote>'If a man [catches someone in adultery] with his wife or mother or sister or daughter or pallake whom he keeps for (procreating) free children, he shall not go into exile for having killed on account of these' </quote><fnote>Demosthenes.23.Aristokrates. 53 </fnote>Just notes the pallake is 'explicitly included in the list of those categories of women who fall under a man's kyrieia [household], and it is justifiable homicide to kill any man found in adultery with her." This not only reveals how the law protects them, but the assumption that once a woman became a pallake, she would not have any other sexual partners. Yet the pallake described is being used to produce legitimate children, so the law is referring to an Athenian woman, not a foreigner. This law would only apply to those females living with an Athenian whose kyrios (father) had not been able to provide a dowry; it does not show the protection given to pallake of non-Athenian birth. <fnote>Just 1994:52 </fnote>Another law states 'if an alien women shall live as wife with an Athenian, and the Athenian who lives as husband with the alien woman so convicted shall be fined one thousand drachmae'. Wolff believes this literally meant that the cohabitation of a pallake and citizen would have been punishable, but I agree with Just that this is unlikely as it was so common in Athens. Leading politicians, such as Pericles, could not have had a pallake if they were illegal. The law merely prevented alien women bearing legitimate children. <fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira. 16 </fnote><fnote>Wolff 1944:66-8 cited by Just 1994:62 </fnote><fnote>Just 1994:62 </fnote><heading>5.2 Protection from men</heading>The treatment of prostitutes by men seems to differ significantly. Hamel remarks pornoboskos 'were notoriously unpleasant characters' and the texts reveal a sense that women did not wish to work in them. The pallake in On the Stepmother poisoned her lover to avoid such a fate, and Blundell believes the women who worked in the brothels would sometimes have been 'brutally treated by their clients'. I found no evidence to support this and believe it unlikely that they would have been beaten too frequently, as they would have been undesirable to other men, and so any damage created would have been required to be compensated by the pornoboskos. The pornai may have had some protection from their owners, whereas there are pictures showing aulētrides being sexually assaulted. Sparkes writes of how 'girls were sometimes forced into simultaneous oral and genital or anal sex. In a world where men ruled and slavery was the norm, women submitted with grace or were forced against their will.'  <fnote>Hamel 2003:33 </fnote><fnote>Antiphon.1.On the Stepmother.16 </fnote><fnote>Blundell 1998:224 </fnote><fnote>Sparkes 1998:254 </fnote>The hetairai's clients may have protected them; Phryne was defended by her lover, Hyperides, when she was charged with organising an immoral cult. Neaira, however, was preventing from returning to Corinth. Hamel thinks this was because Timanoridas and Eucrates wanted to ensure they would not have to protect her. Once a hetaira had lost her looks, she would not have been able to support her luxurious upbringing. The men may have been ensuring that when Neaira grew old they would not have to 'underfoot a woman to whom, because of their former relationship, they might feel some obligation'. Carey feels Neaira being 'nervous of violating this condition' could imply a penalty was attached, such as her being returned to her status of a slave. I think that both these reasons apply. Apollodorus even appears to pity her in the way that Phynion treated her, as he does not reprimand her on leaving him and seems to pass no judgement on the fact she ran away from him, stealing the items he had brought her. He actually appears to justify her actions, as he begins the section by saying she was 'mistreated outrageously'. <fnote>Pomeroy 1975:141 </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:37 </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:37 </fnote><fnote>Carey 1992:102 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira. 35 </fnote><heading>5.3 Security</heading>The porne could be shown as having a secure livelihood in the brothel as she would be provided with work and a place to stay. However, the pornoboskos did not have to keep any porne that did not provide him with money, so it is not clear how secure these women's livelihoods would be. The aulētrides can be regarded as having no security as they had to fend for themselves and if they were not desired by men on the streets or for the symposium; they could rely on no-one else for food or shelter. The hetaira's education, which will be examined later, could have enabled them to have a more secure livelihood. They would be sought after by men and were the social equal to the male, being able to take part in activities the wife had been denied, ensuring they were provided for. Socrates, for example, was willing to converse with Aspasia but did not educate his wife. This could show that men wanted to support females that they could involve in their intellectual world. However, the status could be perceived as higher today due to our views on equality and our belief that women should be educated and involved in all elements that men can access. Women in the ancient Greek world may not have had this view and might not have wanted to be involved in politics and converse. Pomeroy argues that 'we know of some courtesans who attempted to live as respectable wives, while we know of no citizen wives who wished to be courtesans'. This could reveal that wives did not want to have the lives of a hetaira. It could also be argued that the hetaira joined in the intellectual debates because it was expected of them but it does not mean they enjoyed this aspect of their career. However, it could also be debated that it was easier for the courtesan to take up a different position than the wife. The kyrios and husband were entitled to kill their daughter's or wife's lover, and in some cases the female themselves, so it seems unlikely they would be willing to risk this in order to begin life as a prostitute, especially as they would have no money to fund themselves, so might have to choose the life of the porne or aulētris. Even though the wives were aware their husbands had prostitutes, they may have been naïve to the opportunities this gave the hetairai. It would be difficult to be envious of a lifestyle you were unaware of. In light of this, the hetairai's status could be higher than Pomeroy suggests. A wife, however, would have more security than a hetaira; she would be married by her father, the dowry ensuring that if divorced she would be supported or could return to her parents' home. This security could act as a disincentive for having a new career, as the hetaira was never certain if she would have a client or if they would remain interested in her. This can be revealed by what Demeas said to Chrysis. <fnote>Pomeroy 1975:92 </fnote><fnote>Lysias.1.On the murder of Eratoshenes: defence.25f 'It is not I who am going to kill you, but our city's law which you have transgressed and regarded as of less account than your pleasures, choosing rather to commit this foul offence against my wife and my children than to obey the laws like a decent person.' </fnote><quote>'A fine figure you'll cut! Yes, you will see Exactly who you are when you're in town.  The other girls, not in your style, Chrysis, Who only earn ten drachmas, all run off To dinner parties and they drink neat wine Until they die or, if they don't accept Such invitations readily, they starve.'</quote><fnote>Menander.Samia. 390-6 </fnote>On the Stepmother also reveals how desperate a pallake's situation could be; without the love potion Philoneos would have sent her to a brothel with porne in, by giving the love potion she was tortured and then killed. This instability can be shown through Neaira. She only purchased her freedom from Eucrates and Timanoridas, on the condition she no longer worked in Corinth. Apollodorus offers no explanation to why they required this. Carey believed it was because she would have reminded them 'of their wilder days'. Hamel disagrees, believing it was a requirement set by the male relatives of their future brides, or that they were unwilling to feel an obligation to support her when she grew old and no longer had her looks to rely on. The condition left her in a difficult situation as Corinth was the main city for prostitution, and she was forced to work in Megara. The Megarians did not spend a lot of money on hetaira and the war had made this situation worse so the life of the hetaira was not guaranteed to be always plentiful and luxurious. <fnote>Antiphon.1.On the Stepmother.14 </fnote><fnote>Antiphon.1.On the Stepmother.20 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira. 32 </fnote><fnote>Carey 1992:102 </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:36 </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:37 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira. 36 </fnote>The welfare shows that all the prostitutes were disadvantaged when contrasted to the legitimate wife, which could lead scholars to believe that this proved their statuses were the same. However, whereas there are accounts of the aulētrides being abused, there is no evidence to suggest this occurred to hetaira or pallake. The security of the hetaira at first seems great, as she is desired by men who would want to ensure she was supported so she could join them in the intellectual world. Yet the wife always remains superior to the hetaira and pallake, as her security is ensured by the dowry. The pallake, even though she imitates the role of the wife, can always be threatened to a life in the brothel. <heading>6. Relationship with males </heading>The prostitutes relationships with males had an effect on their status. The pornai had a number of clients with a purely sexual relationship, with no intimate bond. Sutton believes this because 'red figure paintings preferred to show rear-entry positions in which there is an emotional distance between lovers'. It is difficult to assess reality on vase paintings as they can not attest to how people really felt. I do believe that of all the prostitutes, the porne do appear to be the ones that are viewed as objects. The way clients picked them, with the porne stood in a semi circle, standing naked and for a small fee, may have had an affect on the way men viewed them. They were cheap, readily available and I believe this lowered their status. Habroton was treated in this manner, as Charisos saw her as a 'thing' to use whilst his fiancé was away; no affection was felt. Fantham agrees the character shows how the relationship with slave prostitutes was 'casual and anonymous'. The pornoboskos would have ensured a porne did not develop an intimate relationship, as they would charge the man who wished to have sex with the female and not allow them to have exclusive rights over the girl. The porne may have wanted to keep their relationships with men brief, as this meant they could have more men and therefore receive more money. Clepsydra, the water clock, 'got her name because she timed her favours by water-clock, stopping when it emptied'. This transformed her into the position of power and dominance over the man, as she decided when the sessions were over and he would have had to pay to continue. <fnote>Sutton 1992:11 </fnote><fnote>Eubulus cited in Davidson 1998:83 </fnote><fnote>Fantham 1975:51-3 cited in Henry 1988:52 </fnote><fnote>Davidson 1998:94 </fnote><fnote>Athenaeus.Deipnosophists. 13.567c-d.Clepsydra by Eubulus. </fnote>The aulētrides spent a similar amount of time with clients as the porne. At the end of a symposium, the girls could have been auctioned off late in the evening to the highest bidder. This could have meant a more affectionate relationship developed, and if the aulētrides were not owned by a pornoboskos, they could have had the opportunity to become a hetaira. Aristophanes' Wasps suggests this would not have happened, as he derives humour from the 'breaking of social conventions'. The play ends with the old man kidnapping the aulētris and using her for his private enjoyment. As this is seen as an unlikely event, perhaps an auletris was not given the social means to be a hetaira. Aristophanes also makes the argument through Right Logic that it is ideal 'not to dart into the house of a dancing-woman' but to show indifference to aulētrides. Theopompus, however, catalogued priceless ancient treasures made to lovers, some of which were aulētrides. <fnote>Athenaeus.Deipnosophists. 13.607 'when the flutegirl was put up for the highest bidder, as is the custom in drinking bouts.' </fnote><fnote>Just 1994:139 </fnote><fnote>Aristophanes.Clouds.994-6 </fnote><quote>'To the flute girl Bromias... Phallus gave a silver karchesion, a votive offering of Phocaea, and an ivy wreath of gold, the offering of Paparethus...to Pharsalia, the dancing girl from Thessaly, Philomelus gave a laurel crown of gold, a votive offering of Lampsacus'</quote><fnote>Theopompus FGR Hist 115 F248 cited in Davidson 1998:122 </fnote>The relationships men had with hetairai could be complex. Metaneira and Lysias appear to have been extremely close and in paying for her to be initiated; he revealed he was not in the relationship for his own gain. He was her client so she had to respond to him and be attentive, yet he went further to ensure she gained as well. It was an act of generosity to his hetaira, revealing the affection he felt towards her. <fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira. 21 </fnote>This leads me to believe that males did not want the hetaira only for sex, and after further examination it is shown that Henry agrees with this view stating 'male characters delight in courtesans' services. There is more than an appreciation of their sexual services; rather, the men seem to value the women's companionship and skills. The hetaira, and in some cases, pallake, were the only women who could be involved in the male world. The aulētrides appeared at symposia but they were sent away when converse began. The hetaira remained throughout and could learn a great deal. Their relationship was far more intimate and this had great implications on their status. <fnote>Henry 1988:37 </fnote>The pallakai were meant to have exclusive relationships with their partners. One of Plautus' plays includes a contract between Diabolus and Clearata, for the services of the latter's daughter. Diabolus requires the girl to spend all her time with him for a year, and must adhere to paranoid sub clauses such as not looking at other men and only swearing to female deities. As a satire, it exaggerates reality, but it does share some formulaic clauses with actual contracts. Similarly Demeas finds it unacceptable that Chrysis has been with another man. The relationship the pallake had with men is the biggest piece of evidence to show how their status was greater than the other prostitutes. Demeas threatens Chrysis with the idea of being an aulētris, as stated previously. This suggests that even though pornai and aulētrides would become pallakai, it was not desirable to return to such a position once you had changed roles. This is because the status of the pallake was so much greater and Henry remarks this status would have been noted by everyone; 'for the slaves and the cook consider her [Chrysis] and Demeas mistress and master." Aspasia appears to have had an exclusive sexual relationship with Pericles, but entertained a number of the leading, most powerful men at her symposia. Pericles gained as much from the relationship as Aspasia; she was his intellectual superior. She appears to have been treated equally and had access to the greatest philosophers of Athens. She was able to express her views and be taken seriously. Henry believes 'Pericles made political capital off his ex-wife's marriage...it is not unreasonable to suspect that his association with Aspasia brought with it some political advantage as well'.  <fnote>Davidson 1998:97 </fnote><fnote>Davidson 1998:97 </fnote><fnote>Menander.Samia.line references unclear as fragments from beginning of Act 2. </fnote><fnote>Menander.Samia. 390-6 </fnote><fnote>Henry 1988:72 </fnote><fnote>Brainard (11.07.05) </fnote><fnote>Rankin 1986:8 cited in Henry 1995:144 </fnote><fnote>Henry 1995:13 </fnote><heading>7. Education </heading>The prostitute's education can reveal the amount of time they spent with their clients, which affected their status. I will look at the teachings they had in regards to philosophical thought, sexual development and converse. <heading>7.1 Philosophical education</heading>There is no evidence to suggest that the pornai or aulētrides had any training in philosophical matters. In contrast, Just argued 'any woman who was likely to become the intellectual and, in a sense, the social equal of a man would have to be a hetaira, for it was in that capacity alone that a woman could have entry into male society'. Athenian men allowed their hetaira to listen to their philosophical debates and they may have earned more money if they could show an ability to add to the discussion. Philosophy and the ability to hold a conversation were important 'attributes that made them more entertaining companions to Athenian men at parties than their legitimate wives', for their wives would have been brought up with a purely domestic education. Just reveals the differences between the two types of women; <fnote>Just 1994:144 </fnote><fnote>Pomeroy 1975:89 </fnote><quote>'perhaps Kristoboulos did not talk to his wife on the justifiable grounds that she had little to say that was of interest to him; but like Socrates and Perikles, he may well have found time to discuss affairs with those hetairai who were well informed as well as for hire. ' </quote><fnote>Just 1994: 144 </fnote>Nikarete understood the importance of such an education, ensuring all her girls were interesting to their clients. She knew how to 'train them artfully' and at a young age took Neaira to dine with men, an ideal experience, teaching her what was expected in terms of converse and sexual activity. <fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira. 18 </fnote>The wives' education was chiefly in the hands of their husbands, and their mothers beforehand, so would have been limited. The wives were not meant to mix with other males, so could not have involved themselves in discussions. The hetairai, on the other hand, were able to develop their opinions and gain information from a variety of men at the symposium. They had 'access to the intellectual life at Athens', which other women were denied. <fnote>Pomeroy 1975:92 </fnote>Of those pallakai who had been hetairai, they would have had teachings in philosophy, but there is no evidence for the philosophical education of all pallakai. Aspasia is remarked upon due to her philosophical ideas but it is difficult to assess whether she was the norm. She 'has no known male mentor, she is no one's student and seems to have come intellectually out of no where'. Some scholars believe her father provided her education in a very thorough manner, and was later developed, if the sources are to be believed, in her position as a hetaira. There is no evidence to back up these claims. Her skill in philosophical thought enabled her to meet with the leading men in Athenian society, including Socrates and Pericles. Interestingly, Plutarch states Pericles 'was attracted to Aspasia mainly because of her rare political wisdom' and Socrates visited her to hear what she had to say. This implies that they gained far more from the relationship than she did, and her association with these men was unusual. It is unlikely she acted as a hetaira as Socrates 'friends brought their wives to hear her', something unlikely to have occurred if she had been involved in the sex industry.  <fnote>Henry 1995:130 </fnote><fnote>PBS (11.07.05) </fnote><fnote>Brainard (11.07.05) </fnote><fnote>Plutarch.Pericles.24.5 </fnote><fnote>Plutarch.Pericles.24.3 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira.22 Lysias did not take Metaneira into his house 'out of regard for his wife'. </fnote>Socrates appreciated the thoughts of Aspasia saying, 'I am convinced that she was right' on her views on match making. He also values her views on marriage, believing she could 'give you a far more knowledgeable account of all this than I can." Socrates may, however, have been making a joke on Aspasia, stating as a prostitute she would have experience on finding a partner so could advise others. Her values on marriage may also have been a cynical joke, stating that she was knowledgeable on ruining a marriage, as she was seen as the cause of Pericles failed marriage. Menander also highlights this view when Habroton replies 'Yes, yours',  implying 'she wishes lots of homes were turned 'upside down' with husbands being unfaithful to their wives, so that she can therefore be successful in her profession'. This reveals an important element of the prostitution business in ancient Greece. When married, an Athenian could use a porne, aulētris and hetaira frequently, as it did not threaten the position of the wife and have a negative affect on the social order. Married men were not, however, meant to have a pallake, as it could lead, as in the case of Pericles, to the Athenian being replaced. This shows how the pallake's status rose above the Athenians, a custom that was not looked upon favourably. <fnote>Xenophon.Memorabila.2.6.36 </fnote><fnote>Xenophon.Oeconomicus. 3.14 </fnote><fnote>Menander.The Arbitration. line 168 </fnote><fnote>Balme 2001:168 </fnote><heading>7.2 Sexual education</heading>In regards to sexual training, Hamel believed all prostitutes may have had access to the pamphlets that were circulated at the time; 'prostitutes may indeed have required some instructions in technique to become adept at the trade: during the fourth century sex manuals proliferated, and a daunting range of sexual positions were evidently employed by professionals." Although I agree that a number of sexual positions would have been employed, I find it very unlikely that sex manuals would have existed. The main reason behind my argument is that it is unlikely any of the prostitutes would have been literate; although it is possible the females could have gained suitable information from pictures. The pornai may have been given instruction by their pornoboskos, and could have learnt from their clients and fellow pornai. The most popular position seems to have been with the female on top, in the 'race-horse' position, she would have needed to show that she was confident and in control. Many of the pornai may have taken the initiative to conduct their own training and develop their abilities. It is also clear that deflowering a virgin was desirable, so appearing innocent and scared was effective in the early years of their career. As they grew older it was perhaps difficult to prove they were virgins, so it would have been advantageous to appear confident. <fnote>Hamel 2003:25 </fnote><fnote>Hamel 2003:6 </fnote>The hetairai offer most evidence for their sexual training and 'Neaira's high price presumably reflects her skill in her trade and consequent celebrity'. Apollodorus does not offer examples of the training Nikarete provided, and it was not necessarily in the art of sex. There is evidence the hetairai were trained in flirtation techniques, as there was <fnote>Carey (1992:101) Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira. 26 </fnote><fnote>Demosthenes.59.Against Neaira. 18 </fnote><quote>'unaccustomed female intercourse as soon as women entered the andron and removed their veils and flirtation could be elaborated a long way in looks and stares, jokes and innuendo, kisses and caresses before the question of bed arose'</quote><fnote>The andron was the male's dining room </fnote><fnote>Davidson 1998:95 </fnote>Flirting was especially important in antiquity, as Davidson shows through the suitor in Plautus' The Ass-dealer. Flirting may have been a more important sexual tool in that era, because wives were prevented from doing it, so the smallest contact of 'treading on a man's foot' or 'coughing' may have been far more charged than in modern society. Indeed even seeing a man at a funeral was seen as potentially dangerous, as the wife's chastity was at risk when ever she came into contact with an unrelated male.  <fnote>Davidson 1998:95 </fnote><fnote>Lysias.1.On the murder of Eratoshenes: defence.8 </fnote>Socrates remarks on Theodote provide evidence the hetairai were expected to be professionals in making men feel good sexually; <quote>'As for loving, I am sure that you know how to love not only passively, but with real affection; and you convince your lovers that you are fond of them, I know, not by words but by deeds.'</quote><fnote>Xenophon.Memorabilia. 3.11.10 </fnote>It could be argued Socrates emphasises the element she is not passive, as a way of contrasting her to the wives the lovers leave at home, as sex in a marriage was only meant to be carried out for the procreation of children. <heading>7.3 Education in conversation</heading>Education in conversation was not required by pornai, whose sexual relations with men occurred in a quick fashion with numerous clients. Men were led down an alley way for quick relief, or if they paid for them in a brothel, it is unlikely the pornoboskos would have allowed them to spend time chatting. When the porne were not providing sexual gratification, as previously argued, they were expected to work at the loom. <fnote>Hamel 2003:5 </fnote>It is unlikely the aulētrides were required to converse. On the streets they were used in a similar way to the pornai. At the symposia the girls were required to perform on musical instruments, dance and provide sexual entertainment. They were not expected to interact with men. In Xenophon's Symposium the two aulētrides are used for the visual needs of the men; one dances as the other plays the flute. Throughout the symposium they are watched and only spoken to when the men require them to vote on who they would kiss, not to converse with them on any other level. The requirement is based on intimacy, revealing the aulētrides were always viewed as a sexual element at the symposium, not a female that men discussed matters of importance with. When men did want to discuss serious matters, they sent the aulētrides away. <fnote>Xenophon.Symposium.2.1-2 </fnote><fnote>Xenophon.Symposium.5.9 </fnote><fnote>Plato.Symposium.176e 'Eryximachus said, 'my next suggestion is that the pipe-girl who's just come in is allowed to go...today let's spend our time together in conversation'. </fnote>The hetaira's role required her to have training in converse, interlinking philosophy but also covering art, wit and the ability to persuade that they were willing to do something for free. They were 'valued for their intellectual as well as their sexual companionship', and were a separate body to the porne and aulētris, who acted as a relief for sexual tension. Henry states; <fnote>Blundell 1998:243 </fnote><quote>'Mytilus begins to answer the philosopher's rebukes (13.571a4). He claims that he had praised not prostitutes whose services were expensive but rather those who are 'true companions' (13.671ci), those who can keep 'a friendship undeceitful' (13.571c2). A prostitute demonstrates undeceitful friendship by flattering a man and cheering him up when he arrives downcast, kissing him, having nice table manners, and giving away her sexual favours on occasion (13.571e4 - 572b7). '</quote>It is the element of friendship, described by Mytilus, that shows her status is higher, as she offers more to the male. She could not appear to be a prostitute who men used for sexual purposes and then left. Theodote does not out rightly explain her profession to Socrates. She explains 'if anyone gets friendly with me, and wants to be generous, that's how I get my living'. Socrates works out the true meaning of her relationships and shows what was required of the hetaira; <fnote>Xen.Memorabila.3.11.4 </fnote><quote>'it is in your mind, which teaches you to look charming and talk gaily, and tells you that you must give a warm welcome to an attentive lover, but bolt the door against a selfish one; that if a lover falls ill you must look after him devotedly; that, if he has a stroke of luck, you must share his pleasures enthusiastically; and that, if he cares for you deeply, you must gratify him wholeheartedly.' </quote><fnote>Xen.Memorabila.3.11.10 </fnote>A hetaira needed her client to believe she cared for him and did not require gifts, she could then avoid the negative elements that came with the prostitution business, for example tax. It was crucial to conceal what they truly were and 'upon the fragile status of the gift depended their fragile status as 'companions' rather than common prostitutes'. This is why the art of converse was so important; if the hetaira was unable to persuade her client she had genuine feelings for him, she could not continue in her line of work. <fnote>Davidson 1998:124 </fnote>Pallakai were probably selected on their ability to converse with Athenian men. Plato says Aspasia was the instructor of Socrates in rhetoric and the possible author of Pericles' funeral oration. She conversed often with Socrates and they influenced one another. She was 'renowned - or rather notorious - for her clever and persuasive talk and her political astuteness'. It is argued she had a great deal of influence over Pericles, and Pomeroy felt 'there is a good deal of truth contained in the Menexenus of Plato...that she had the reputation of associating with many Athenians as a teacher of rhetoric'.  <fnote>Plato.Menexeus. 236b6 </fnote><fnote>Blundell 1998:244 </fnote><fnote>Pomeroy 1975:89 </fnote><heading>8. Conclusion</heading>I believe that there were different types of prostitutes in antiquity and these could have been identified by the ancient Greeks. There are constant problems related to this issue, mainly because of the difficulties in regards to the terminology. Scholars have not been consistent when using the terminology and this has led to confusion. Through looking at the original texts, I believe a stronger argument can be made to show that there were different statuses, and the terms were not just a variety of names applied to the same sort of females. That is not to say it was always clear, as Neaira showed; when living with Nikarete and Timanoridas and Eucrates arguments could have been made for her being a porne or hetaira. If the terminology is set aside, it can always been shown that the prostitutes tried to increase their status to that of the hetaira or pallake and so this was clearly preferable to the position of auletris or porne. .
