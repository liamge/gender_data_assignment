<heading>1. Introduction</heading>The Freddie Mac scandal has been one of several high profile corporate scandals in the recent past. The scandal has added to the falling reputation of auditing and crucially emphasises the case for tighter regulation and more stringent rules within the auditing profession. The question is whether the public demands on increased responsibility of auditors to detect fraud is really one that can be reasonably expected of the audit. Ultimately, this relates to the expectations gap and the issues that have surfaced as a result. The purpose of this report is to highlight the areas of accountability involved in the Freddie Mac scandal focussing particularly on independence, liability and corporate governance and to discuss their impact on auditing and the profession. The report also gives some recommendations to improve the credibility of auditing. <heading>2. Background to the Case</heading><heading>a) Who is Freddie Mac? </heading>Originally known as Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Freddie Mac is a stockholder-owned corporation chartered by Congress in 1970. Freddie has a public aim to stabilise the nation's mortgage markets and expand opportunities for homeownership and affordable rental housing. Primarily, Freddie's role is to serve as secondary market conduit between mortgage lenders and investors. It purchases mortgages from mortgage lenders (commercial banks and other financial institutions) and repackages them into securities (mortgage-backed and debt) which are then sold to investors. <fnote>In the late 1960s, interest rates varied widely that the mortgage market was unpredictable and loans were hard to get. </fnote><figure/>Moreover, Freddie is a Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) in which it has a distinct relationship with the Government and enjoys special perks and privileges. In addition to receiving $2.25bn in credit from the government, it is exempt from state and local taxes and not subjected to standard disclosure rules imposed on other financial institutions. Furthermore, Freddie Mac is regulated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) in the United States, department of Housing and Urban Development. <fnote>'Freddie Mac's Accounting Scandal' Daily Policy Digest, Federal Spending & The Budget / Home Loan Programs. 16th July 2003 </fnote><heading>b) What went wrong? </heading>The root of Freddie's problems can be found in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 133, which determines accounting rules when derivatives are used as hedges. The rules require companies to assign current market values to the interest-rate swaps, options, and other derivatives they hold and to reflect any changes in their value on the balance sheet. Additionally, companies can offset any gains (or losses) on an asset with a similar loss (or gain) on the derivative used as a hedge. Crucially, any changes in a derivative's value can be recognised over the life of the hedge, allowing companies to avoid the volatility that market-value accounting creates. Freddie took advantage of this loophole in hedge accounting to amortise gains and thus smooth company earnings, effectively boosting investor and lender confidence in the company. Additionally, the stability also helped ward off politicians who might point to volatility as a reason to tighten regulations. <figure/><heading>3. Issues in Auditing</heading>In this scandal, there are several issues in auditing, which the industry needs to address. <heading>Liability</heading>Firstly, there are questions of accountability; of the numerous parties involved, who was actually responsible for the scandal. <heading>Freddie Mac</heading>Much of the public think that the core of the problem was Freddie's lack of attention to the staffing, skill set and resources it set to its accounting policies. The policies were clearly weak or non-existent. Within Freddie, there were apparent deficiencies in internal controls, processes which would provide reasonable assurance and also assist in compliance testing. Such measure would have surely provided a safeguard against errors in financial reporting. It is widely held that it is the responsibility of a corporation for maintaining a control environment that will, among other things, accurately record and account for transactions. Many senior staff members at Freddie Mac claim that the incorrect financial reporting was 'an honest mistake." If this was the case, then Freddie, undoubtedly, was over reliant on the external auditor. However, the press have scrutinised the intentions management suggesting that they were deliberately misstating earnings. <fnote>'In the Money: Freddie Mac's Shuffling Games' Michael Rapoport, 27 July 2003 </fnote><heading>The auditor</heading>Auditors have a duty to form and express an opinion as to whether the company's accounts demonstrate an accurate view of the entity's financial position. Arthur Andersen, the auditor, judged that Freddie's accounts were compliant with GAAP and therefore the audit was 'unqualified'. In doing so, Andersen appeared to have failed to notice the fact that Freddie kept their loan loss reserves at levels higher than that permitted by GAAP, maintaining a reserve account to cushion fluctuations in premiums and discounts resulting from mortgage prepayments. Neither did Andersen realise Freddie's illegitimate reporting of the derivatives trading. Many people feel that the auditors, as professionals and specialists, should be responsible for realising such material misstatement. It is widely acknowledged in the auditing profession that it is the auditor's responsibility in detecting fraud through a company's internal controls. Such cases highlight the expectations gap whereby 'auditors are performing at a variance with the beliefs and desires of those whose benefit the audit are being carried out'.  <fnote>' Current Issues in Auditing' Sherer and Turley, 2005, p 48 </fnote><fnote>' Current Issues in Auditing' Sherer and Turley, 2005, p 9 </fnote><figure/>However, it is commonly accepted that auditors cannot be held liable for every incident of fraud in companies. A crucial deciding factor on auditor liability concerns the extent to which the auditor dedicated adequate time and resources to the audit, and whether sufficient assurance was provided through substantive and compliance testing. It must be remembered that it is not the auditor's responsibility to detect fraud. Rather the auditor has a responsibility to "properly plan, perform and evaluate their audit work so as to have a reasonable expectation of detecting material misstatements in financial statements." At present, the general consensus is that if the auditor provides 'reasonable skill and care' in their work, they would not be held liable for fraud. However, such material misstatements associated with fraud would ultimately affect the truth and fairness of the report, hence would suggest audit failure. <fnote>'Current Issues in Auditing' Sherer and Turley, 2005, pg 39 </fnote><fnote>'Auditing: Theory and Practice.' Dunn </fnote><heading>The regulator</heading>In this case, OFHEO, Freddie's regulator is also involved. OFHEO's mission is to ensure the safe and sound operation of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. OFHEO employs a full range of supervisory and enforcement tools including examinations, capital standards, and prompt corrective action procedures suggesting that perhaps, OFHEO should have detected the misstatements earlier. Furthermore, there has been public pressure for OFHEO's replacement. <fnote>the only two organisations it regulates. </fnote><heading>b) Corporate Governance</heading>The scandal highlighted several issues in Corporate Governance, many which now have been addressed in the Sarbanes Oxley Act and the Higgs and Smith reports. Firstly, Freddie's chairman and CEO was the same individual, Leland Brendsel. This structure implies too much empowerment in an individual resulting in transparency and communication problems in within the company. Additionally, Freddie's remuneration structure rewarded executives with extortionate pay for high performance. Arguably, such incentives encouraged management to inflate earnings. Moreover, the remuneration disclosure was not clearly reported for. Another hot topic is the retirement packages of senior executives. Freddie gave out huge retirement compensations which were largely unrelated to their performance e.g. Brendsel retired with more than $24 million in stock, bonuses and benefits. Much of the public were startled at this figure which is overly generous to say the least. <fnote>'Trouble at home' The Economist, 14/6/2003 issue number 8328 pg 70-74 </fnote>Finally, because of Freddie's political objectives, it is one of only two companies which are exempt from disclosing certain information to the SEC which is highly controversial due to differential treatment, especially as it concerns a public company. This suggests that Freddie's unique position eroded transparency in its accounting facilitating its ability to commit unidentifiable fraud. <fnote>The US Securities and Exchange Commission </fnote><heading>c) Independence</heading>'Independence' has a unique status within auditing and figures amongst the postulates as can be seen in the diagram below. <figure/>Consequently, independence is 'essential for ensuring the credibility of auditors' work' and is referred to as 'the cornerstone of auditing'. <fnote>Porter, Simon and Hatherly; 2003, p 45 </fnote><fnote>Stewart; 1997 and Levit; 2000 </fnote>For the auditor's opinion to be credible, the auditors must be perceived to be independent from management and the company. This is reflected in the fundamental 'objectivity and independence' principle of auditing where it is essential that auditors are both: Independent in fact Auditor maintains an objective unbiased attitude of mind uninfluenced by personal bias Independent in appearance Avoid situations which might cause others to conclude that the auditor might not be maintaining an unbiased attitude of mind i.e. have mutual or conflicting interests with client/management. Despite the apparent simplicity of these requirements, in reality, independence is easily compromised as illustrated by the Freddie scandal. There are many threats to independence and steps and proposes have been designed to preserve independence. The Guide to Professional Ethics Statement (GPES) 1 has identified 5 broad 'threats' to auditors' independence. These are <list>self interest self-review advocacyfamiliarity trust and intimidation threat. </list><heading>Length of relationship</heading>It can be considered that the self interest threat always exists to a certain extent as "auditors are hired, fired and paid by their clients' managements" therefore auditors are under pressure to provide clean reports. The fact that Andersen were the auditors for 22 years is controversial falling under the 'familiarity or trust' threat. Professional bodies have always recognised that personal, family and business relationships with an audit client may impair independence. The long relationship questions if Andersen auditors were becoming over-influenced by the personal relationships inevitably developed with the directors/senior management. In addition to possibly being over-sympathetic to the management, they may also have become too trusting of the management resulting in insufficient audit testing. <fnote>Briloff; 1986, and Mitchell and Saka; 1993 </fnote><heading>Audit fees</heading>GPES 1 identifies risky situations to avoid, one of them being undue dependence on an audit client for fee income, to prevent the compromise of independence. As Andersen's sixth largest client, Freddie Mac paid huge audit fees of US$1.1m, a sum which could jeopardize independence and objectivity as 'auditors are unlikely to bite the hand that feeds them!'  <fnote>Porter, Simon and Hatherly; p 78 </fnote><heading>Non-audit fees</heading>Like placing undue dependence on audit clients for fee income, the provision of non audit services to audit clients is regarded as a serious threat to auditors' independence, both in fact and  in appearance. Whether provision of non-audit services to an audit client should be allowed has been an ongoing debate. Back when Andersen audited Freddie's financial statements, the rules were less stringent, especially in the US as the SEC introduced newer stricter independence rules in 2001. As auditors become familiar with all aspects of the client, it is argued that they are in a prime position to provide financial and managerial advice. This reduces costs as new consultants would need to familiarise themselves with the corporation. Moreover, external consultants may only focus on particular areas hence the perception that auditors providing consulting work appreciate the wider entity. However this increased efficiency and effectiveness comes at a high cost of independence. In 2000, Andersen received US$5.8m in consulting fees compared to US$1.1m for audit services. Clearly, there is huge incentive for Andersen to remain on good terms with Freddie and ultimately, audit objectivity is impaired by self-interest. Finally, because so much consulting was being provided, Andersen could be perceived as being too involved with the audit client's management to conduct the audit in an unbiased manner. <heading>Revolving doors? </heading>Strict guidelines exist regarding ex-employees of the audit client becoming an auditor of the company, as well as former principals/employees of the audit firm joining of the audit client. This did not appear to have been upheld as people joked that the Freddie Mac/Andersen relationship was one of a 'virtual revolving door' during the scandal right through to senior management; Gregory Reyolds became Freddie's senior Vice President and John Woods joined the Investment Division as a senior from Andersen. Interestingly, during the scandal's investigation, Andersen claimed that they did not have the expertise or competence to understand the complicated derivatives transactions that were scrutinised of which facilitated the smoothing of profits. The question is, if they were indeed incompetent, how did Andersen staff move to take positions in Freddie's Investment Divisions, especially as vice president? It appears that Andersen was not in a position to objectively evaluate the financial statements and to give an independent opinion on the state of the Freddie's financial performance and position. They lacked credibility and independence was threatened on multiple levels. <heading>4. Implications on the auditing and accounting profession</heading>This scandal is one out of a long list of similar scandals such as Enron and WorldCom, which collectively have damaged the reputation of the auditing profession. The outcome resulted in the further downfall of Andersen where it adds to the more than 100 auditing related civil legislations pending against the firm. <heading>a) The Sarbanes Oxley Act 2002 (SOX) </heading>The surge in corporate scandals raised public concerns of issues such as independence and corporate governance in many of the high profile cases. These issues prevail in the Freddie case and their existence highlighted the need for the SOX and more stringent regulation. SOX formally removed the self regulatory monopoly in the auditing profession by requiring the rotation of external auditors after a 5 year period in an attempt to improve independence. Moreover, auditors are no longer permitted to provide non-audit services to audit client and the increasing influence of audit committees and mandatory inclusion of non-executive directors, all further contributing to enhance independence between the auditor and client. <fnote>Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002, Title II </fnote>The SOX attempts to improve the balance of power within corporations by requiring the separation of CEO and chairman positions. Such distinction aids communication and increases transparency within firms, effectively reducing the chance of fraud occurring. Additionally, by setting clear management roles and functions, directors can be held accountable for their actions. Moreover, stricter rules now exist regarding the disclosure of director remuneration which is a preventative measure against 'slush-fund-accounting'; understating quarterly profits as a precautionary measure to protect manager remuneration. Furthermore, the SOX has placed greater emphasis of audit committees the mandatory inclusion of non-executive directors has helped increase the chances of independence between the auditor and client. <fnote> URL  </fnote>Clearly, the SOX has tackled many of the underlying issues regarding the scandals and appears have restored some confidence in the auditing profession. <heading>b) Selection of audit clients </heading>Subsequently, it is argued that the effect of this scandal (and others) prompted auditors to be more cautions in taking up risky clients. Even if the audit is carried out thoroughly, auditors may be unable to identity or detect misstatements for clients with complex accounting issues such as Freddie. As a result, auditors themselves may be held liable facing civil lawsuits tarnishing their reputation and causing financial distress. Andersen's reputation was severely damaged by the Enron and Freddie scandals causing many companies to rethink their relationship with Andersen. <heading>c) Increasing auditing fees</heading>Following these scandals, auditors may decide to increase their auditing fees as insurance against riskier clients. Besides that, it is noted that audit exists because of the insurance hypothesis. This suggests that the more accounting scandals are exposed, the higher the reliance on audited financial statements by companies. This then brings increased liability to audit firms (including additional work and resources to ensure a true unqualified audit) which leads to an increase in audit fees. <fnote>Wallace W., The Economic Role of the Audit in Free and Regulated Markets, 1980, pg. 28 </fnote><heading>d) Regulation</heading>It is imperative that we know the criterion to judge if an auditor's did a good job or not in order to assess the credibility of an audit firm as an inspector of the financial statements. Consequently, the question of 'who controls the auditors?' is ongoing. However, it is observed that in the US, the big four accounting firm are now being inspected by an independent regulator to assess the quality of an audit firm. This trend may follow in other countries especially those with serious issues of accounting scandals. <heading>e) Provision of services by auditing firms</heading>Finally, accounting scandals such as Freddie highlights that audit firms should start focusing their business on 'just auditing'. Audit firms should not offer other non-audit services such as tax or business advisory to companies that they audit. This would increase auditor credibility and independence because incentives to keep the client satisfied and retain the relationship to gain more lucrative contracts in the future would be removed. <heading>5. Summary and Conclusions</heading>The Freddie Mac case is one of many corporate scandals that have brought attention to the failure of audits to detect material misstatements in the financial reports associated with fraud. inij As a result, there have been tangible developments in auditing, focussing on independence, corporate governance and auditor liability. However, this scandal was revealed six months after the introduction of SOX which addresses many of the weaknesses in auditing which were relevant to the Freddie case. Nevertheless, many feel the SOX is flawed despite it being a step in the right direction. With regards to remuneration, departing executives continue to leave companies with huge severance packages which many feel is undeserved. Furthermore, as declared by Imhoff, despite the new five-year staff rotation rule, it is <quote>"only a modest improvement over the old seven-year rule and will be just as ineffective. To meet the seven-year rule the lead audit partner would be rotated off in the seventh year and then rotate back onto the engagement in the eighth year." </quote><fnote>Imhoff (2003), p.124 </fnote>We can only expect similar practices regarding the new rule. Imhoff then went on to suggest a three-year mandatory rotation arguing that auditors would then worry far less about losing their clients, and this in turn enhances auditor independence. In our opinion however, the benefits of decreasing rotation periods to three years would be outweighed by the costs, contributed mostly by increased set-up costs. Although such frequent rotation would break up the monopoly of the big 4 by presenting more opportunities to smaller firms, the larger firms may resort to low-balling to attain clients. To evaluate the benefits of rotation, it is contended that OFHEO should perform feasibility studies to determine if periodic changes of the external audit firm enhances the soundness and safety of corporations such as Freddie Mac. <fnote>Ibid </fnote>We also feel that the recent initiatives to monitor auditing firms' activities are crucial in restoring confidence to the auditing profession, despite irritating the firms themselves. However, co-operation from the auditing firms is imperative for this to be successful. Additionally, it is widely pointed out that companies should take a more pro-active role in detecting and eliminating accounting misstatements and decrease their reliance on the auditors on the matter. In this case, however, whilst there was clear negligence on behalf of Freddie, evidence suggests that Andersen was partly liable. Finally, the Freddie case, explicitly reveals the need for all US companies, private and public, to be governed by the same rules. Scandals at Fannie Mae, Freddie's sister company, further emphasise that no company or institution should be given favourable treatment. In conclusion, auditors should realise and embrace their social responsibilities, thereby increasing their detection of material misstatements, aiding the identification of fraud. We believe the issues of accountability raised by the Freddie case and other scandals are embodied in the expectations gap; auditor responsibilities are unclear therefore when fraud can scandals occur, it is difficult to point fingers at who should be held accountable for misconduct. Before the auditing profession can successfully tackle the problems, it must first establish the objectives of auditing. However, objectives evolve through time to meet market demands and clearly, much of society expect external auditing to detect fraud. Scandals such as the Freddie case have underlined the recent weaknesses in the auditing profession. Although scandals continue to surface to this date, there have been credible efforts to address these problems. However, in what direction auditing develops in the near future will be determined by the strength of the market to influence the audit objectives and how the profession responds to such pressure.
