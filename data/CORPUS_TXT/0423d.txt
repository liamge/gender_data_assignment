<heading>Introduction</heading>Current research in relation to housing around the world estimates that 1.1 billion people live in inadequate housing conditions in urban areas alone and that 100 million people are homeless. Further, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing has reported that the housing and living conditions around the world are deteriorating.  <fnote>UN HABITAT, Why Housing Rights? < URL > at 17 December 2006. </fnote><fnote>Miloon Kothari, 'Actions to Promote the Realization of the Right to Adequate Housing' in Berma Goldewijk, Adalid Baspineiro and Paulo Carbonari (eds), Dignity and Human Rights: the Implementation of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2002) 285, 291. </fnote>Over recent decades, numerous human rights legal instruments in relation, either directly or indirectly, to housing and living conditions have been negotiated at the international level, demonstrating the willingness of the international community to focus attention on the various manifestations of the housing crisis. In addition, the United Nations and other international organisations have increased their focus on the international right to housing and the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ESCR Committee) has arguably devoted more attention to this right than to any other within its ambit. <fnote>Established under ECOSOC Resolution 1985/17 of 28 May 1985. </fnote><fnote>Matthew C.R.

As is often the case in relation to many human rights, "[t]here can be no doubting that the oft-cited gap between law and practice...is sadly alive and well when it comes to housing rights." In an attempt to narrow this gap, housing rights advocates around the world have pursued a variety of human rights strategies in domestic settings, such as community mobilisation, political campaigning for domestic legislative reform, advocacy before regional and international bodies, and legal challenges before courts of all jurisdictions. <fnote>Scott Leckie, Sources No. 4: Legal Resources for Housing Rights: International and National Standards (2000) Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions 5 < URL > at 28 December 2006. </fnote>This essay focuses on one aspect of the legal approach, namely the use of the international right to housing in domestic courts, and examines the potential for this strategy to effect practical benefit for housing conditions at the local level. To this end, the scope of the international human right to housing will be outlined in the first section of this essay. Secondly, the extent to which the international right to housing is regarded as justiciable, and the basis for judicial reluctance in this regard, will be considered. Finally, the benefits of, and challenges to, the adoption of this legal approach as a strategy for the amelioration of inadequate housing and living conditions will be evaluated. <heading>The Human Right to Housing</heading>The human "right to housing" refers to the body of international, regional and national law which elucidates the general and specific regulation of the dimensions of the right to adequate housing and living conditions for all people around the world. At the international level, numerous treaties and related documents recognise the right to housing, outline its relevant components and describe its obligations. In this regard, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the first human rights standard to recognise housing rights, states: <fnote>Maria Foscarinis, 'Realizing Domestic Social Justice through International Human Rights: Part II: Advocating for the Human Right to Housing: Notes from the United States' (2006) 30 New York University Review of Law & Social Change 447, 448. </fnote><fnote>COHRE, Legal resources on housing rights, < URL > at 17 December 2006. </fnote><quote>"Everyone has the right to a standard living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control." </quote><fnote>Universal Declaration of Human Rights, GA Res 217 A (III), [25], UN Doc A/217 (1948). </fnote>The most significant articulation of the right to housing at an international level, Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) states: <fnote>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment 4: The Right to Adequate Housing, 6th sess, [3], UN Doc E/1992/23 (1991) < URL > at 2 January 2007. </fnote><quote>"The State parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and for his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.

The ICESCR recognises the right to housing as part of the larger right to an adequate standard of living; however, under international human rights law the right to adequate housing is generally now understood as an independent, free-standing right. </fnote>Responsibility for monitoring State party compliance with the Covenant rests with the ESCR Committee. Its General Comment 4, intended to interpret and define Article 11(1) of the ICESCR, is widely deemed to be the most authoritative interpretation of the right to housing.  <fnote>COHRE, above no 7. For a useful overview of the approach of the ESCR Committee to the scope of the right to housing, see Craven, above no 4, 329-349. </fnote>Notably, the ECSR Committee states that "the right to housing should not be interpreted in a narrow or restrictive sense which equates it with, for example, the shelter provided by merely having a roof over one's head or views shelter exclusively as a commodity.". In this regard, the ESCR Committee notes that article 11(1) must be understood as referring not just to housing but to "adequate housing", a concept which includes each of the following factors: legal security of tenure, availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, affordability, habitability, accessibility, location and cultural adequacy. <fnote>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, above no 9, [7]. </fnote><fnote>Ibid [8]. </fnote>The right to housing has been reaffirmed either explicitly or implicitly in a number of additional international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. <fnote>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, opened for signature 16 December 1966, art 17(1) (entered into force 23 March 1976). </fnote><fnote>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, opened for signature 21 December 1965, art 5(e)(iii) (entered into force 4 January 1969). </fnote><fnote>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, opened for signature 18 December 1979, art 14(2)(h) (entered into force 3 September 1981). </fnote><fnote>Convention on the Rights of the Child, opened for signature 20 November 1989, art 27(3) (entered into force 2 September 1990). </fnote><heading>The Justiciability of the International Right to Housing </heading><heading>The Justiciability of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Generally</heading>Historically, the ICCPR and the ICESCR have been perceived as representing two "generations" of human rights, with the economic, social and cultural rights of the latter attracting categorisation as progressive, purely aspirational and consequently non-justiciable. However, the notion that all rights are indivisible and interdependent has been stated and reaffirmed many times. Further, human rights activists, scholars and lawyers have convincingly established that many aspects of economic, social and cultural rights are justiciable through the evolution of innovative methods of creating paths for making such rights justiciable through public interest litigation.  <fnote>Asbjørn Eide and Allan Rosas, 'Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: A Universal Challenge' in Asbjørn Eide, Catarina Krause and Allan Rosas (eds), Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2nd ed, 2001) 3. </fnote><fnote>See generally: Henry J Steiner and Philip Alston (eds), International Human Rights in Context: Law, Politics and Morals (2nd ed, 2000) 275-286 </fnote>Following the conclusion of the Second World War and the accompanying expansion of the international human rights regimes, domestic courts around the world have made increasing use of international standards, whether official treaties or related documents, to assist in local decision-making. This trend has been encouraged by, among other things, an increased willingness of jurists to consider relevant international legal findings or sources, a broader awareness of international legal standards by local advocates, and the widespread dissemination of material on international norms by non-governmental organisations. The globalisation of the world (in its various guises, whether economic, social or technological) has intensified this development through an increased ease and rate of transnational communication. <fnote>Robyn Emerton, Kirstine Adams, Andrew Byrnes and Jane Connors (eds), Women's Human Rights: Leading International and National Cases (2005) xiii. </fnote><fnote>Anne-Marie Slaughter, A New World Order (2004) ch 2. </fnote><fnote>Emerton, Adams, Byrnes and Connors, above no 20. </fnote><heading>Litigating the International Right to Housing</heading>In relation to the international right to housing specifically, the UN Special Rapporteur for the Right to Adequate Housing has emphasised the need for justiciability of this right "in courts at all levels...in order for states effectively to respect, protect, promote and fulfil" this right. <fnote>Miloon Kothari, 'Priority Issues and Impediments to Realizing the Right to Adequate Housing' in Berma Goldewijk, Adalid Baspineiro and Paulo Carbonari (eds), Dignity and Human Rights: the Implementation of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2002) 63, 70. </fnote>The ESCR Committee has explicitly confirmed that the legal principle of justiciability and the provision of domestic legal remedies are applicable to the right to adequate housing. According to the ESCR Committee, the provisions might apply to: "(a) legal appeals aimed at preventing planned evictions or demolitions through the issuance of court-ordered injunctions (b) legal procedures seeking compensation following an illegal eviction (c) complaints against illegal actions carried out or supported by landlords (whether public or private) in relation to rent levels, dwelling maintenance and racial or other forms of discrimination, (d) allegations of any form of discrimination in the allocation and availability of access to housing (e) complaints against landlords concerning unhealthy or inadequate housing conditions" and, in some legal systems, "class action suits in situations involving significantly increased levels of homelessness". <fnote>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, above no 9, [17]. This affirmation by the ESCR Committee was made in the wider context of confirming that many aspects of economic, social and cultural rights generally are justiciable. </fnote><fnote>Ibid. </fnote><fnote>Ibid. This is not an exhaustive list. </fnote><heading>Framing a Legal Claim Using the International Right to Housing </heading>The international right to housing may be used in the context of founding a right of action and/or to assist in the interpretation and application of domestic or regional law. The manner of use will depend primarily on whether the treaties to be relied upon have been incorporated into the domestic laws of the relevant nation-state. <fnote>Anne F. Bayefsky, 'General Approaches to the Domestic Application of Women's International Human Rights Law' in Rebecca Cook (ed), Human Rights of Women: National and International Perspectives (1994) 362, 363. </fnote><fnote>Ibid 356-368. </fnote>Although it is generally the case that courts will construe national law in conformity with their countries' national obligations (even where the relevant treaties have not been expressly incorporated), in the absence of formal incorporation of the international right to housing, the justiciability of housing rights may be hampered by the tension resulting from the balance between a country's international obligations and the protection of its national sovereignty. In particular, courts may be reluctant to award remedies in cases that require government implementation of specific policies necessitating significant budgetary consequences. Appropriate remedies in housing rights cases may necessitate national or local government bodies to expend considerable resources, for example, to conduct large-scale community resettlement or improvements to housing to meet minimum standards. In such situations, the risk exists that courts will defer to the separation of powers doctrine and argue that such cases involve issues that are appropriately dealt with by governments, with deference to their finite resources, rather than by courts.  <fnote>This is an issue in relation to the justiciability of many economic, cultural and social rights. </fnote><fnote>See for example: Bayefsky, above no 27, 356, 359. </fnote><fnote>Malcolm Langford, Litigating Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Achievements, Challenges and Strategies (2003) Centre for Housing Rights and Evictions 11 < URL > at 20 December 2006. </fnote>The challenge for strategic litigation involving housing rights is to encourage the harmonisation or reconciliation of these conflicting considerations in favour of the human rights beneficiaries. The principal strategy in such circumstances has often been to ask courts to acknowledge the socio-economic dimensions of civil and political rights since these are more likely to be actionable, thereby promoting the bridging of generations of rights and strengthening the basis for an active judicial response. <fnote>Ibid [10]. </fnote><heading>The International Housing Rights Law in Domestic Courts</heading><heading>Outcomes of Relevant Cases </heading>The benefits of, and challenges to, the adoption of this legal approach, with its goal of a reduction of inadequate housing and living conditions, is evaluated below, through a consideration of the major patterns emerging from relevant cases and the experiences of housing advocates. Over the past two decades, there have been numerous strategic litigation and judicial test cases on housing rights issues, with both positive and negative results. As one example of a successful outcome, the Constitutional Court of South Africa quoted directly from the ESCR Committee's General Comment No 4 and held that a housing rights plan involving the eviction of 900 people from private property, who were subsequently forced to live on the edge of sports field in horrendous conditions, was flawed due to its failure to uphold the right to housing by progressively addressing emergency relief. <fnote>See for example: COHRE, National Jurisprudence, < URL > at 20 December 2006 for descriptions of cases in Bangladesh, Canada, India, The Philippines, South Africa, and the United States of America. </fnote><fnote>Grootboom v. Oostenberg Municipality Cape Metropolitan Council, et al. Case No. 6826/99 (11 December 1999) Constitutional Court of South Africa. </fnote>A further example of success was documented in Bangladesh in relation to the continued forced eviction of persons without prior notice, where the judgment led to the negotiation of comprehensive plans for resettlement, developed by communities, architects and international agencies. As the right to housing was not directly justiciable through the Constitution of Bangladesh, the claim successfully linked the international right to housing to the rights to life and livelihood.  <fnote>Ask v Government of Bangladesh (1999) Supreme Court of Bangladesh. </fnote><fnote>Abul Hasnat Monjurul Kabir, 'Development and Human Rights: Litigating the Right to Adequate Housing' (2002) 3 Asia-Pacific Journal on Human Rights and the Law 97, 112-117. </fnote>On the other hand, possibly an equal number of cases had no direct impact, failed to achieve their objectives or led to contradictory results in relation to other similar jurisdictions, or even the same jurisdiction. In India, housing rights suffered a setback when its Supreme Court disregarded human rights and India's obligations under the ICESCR in relation to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of tribal people in connection with the construction of the Narmada Dam. Again in India, the Bombay Court gave preference to environmental protection over housing rights in relation to approximately 500,000 people living in poverty in informal settlements. <fnote>Langford, above no 30, 18 and ch 18. </fnote><fnote>Kothari, above no 23, 71, discussing Narmada Bachao Andolan v Union of India and Others (18 October 2000) Supreme Court of India. </fnote><fnote>Ibid, 72. </fnote>While it is beyond the scope of this essay to provide a comprehensive analysis and outcome summaries of the myriad cases which have applied the international right to housing at a domestic level, the lessons learned from the outcomes, both positive and negative, contribute to an understanding of the advantages of this type of strategic litigation. <heading>The Significance of the International Human Rights Framework</heading>The impact of claims that are founded using the international human rights framework is significant. This framework is a highly recognised and authoritative discourse which adds weight to housing rights issues by affirming the legal nature of these rights. It provides a conceptual framework for courts to integrate the norm, standards and principles of the international human rights system into domestic policies, in circumstances in which governments are subject to both positive and negative obligations and the realisation of the right to housing, in all its forms, is necessarily a progressive one given the expenditure of often limited resources. <fnote>Langford, above no 31, 26. </fnote><fnote>See generally: Craven, above no 4, 330-332 in for a discussion in relation to the progressive realisation characteristic of the right to housing and the implications for governments. </fnote>Official recognition of the international right to housing, and with it the corresponding pressure on governments to respect, protect and fulfil its relevant components, provides individual and group claimants with a legitimate avenue of redress in relation to housing rights violations. The right to a legal hearing based on a claim framed by international human rights may be as significant as the remedy itself, particularly in circumstances where many suffering such infringements come from poor communities and minorities, where such groups exert minimal social or political power and courts are sometimes the only official institution that will listen. <fnote>Langford, above no 31, 18. </fnote>Such recognition provides a solid foundation upon which local communities, non-governmental organisations, housing rights advocates and others can more forcefully assert the demand for adequate housing for everyone on the basis that housing rights are human and legal rights, not merely equivocal policy objectives. In this way, merely the use of international human rights law in a domestic setting can become an instrument for empowerment and a long-term strategy to compel policy-makers to take housing rights more seriously. <fnote>Leckie, above no 5, 6. </fnote>In addition, an approach which emphasises the indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights is likely to improve the likelihood of a successful outcome, as it both strengthens and expands the understanding of the right to housing and demonstrates how a judicial response to housing rights issues can have a wide impact. The United Nations has confirmed that "having access to adequate, safe and secure housing substantially strengthens the likelihood of people being able to enjoy certain additional rights." <fnote>Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Fact Sheet No. 21: The Human Right to Adequate Housing <  URL > at 20 December 2006. </fnote>The ESCR Committee has confirmed that the right to housing is "integrally linked to other human rights", which most noticeably include the rights to: safe drinking water and sanitation; health, education, freedom of expression; freedom of association; environmental hygiene; attainment of the highest level of physical and mental health; access to resources; access to basic services, schools, transportation and employment options. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, among others, has made reference to the identifiable nexus between poverty and human rights. <fnote>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, above no 9, [7]. </fnote><fnote>Kabir, above no 36, 98, 104-106. </fnote><fnote>Kothari ,above no 23, 65. </fnote><heading>Key Issues Identified by Housing Rights Advocates</heading>Following a succession of housing rights cases around the world, several key concerns have been recognised by advocates as important considerations when pursuing a legal approach based on the international right to housing. At the outset, careful case selection is imperative, and ought to be founded on an informed understanding of the extent to which housing rights are considered justiciable in the relevant jurisdiction. Whether the litigation utilising the international right to housing has succeeded has often been dependent upon the extent to which courts exercised judicial restraint, such restraint generally increasing as the selected claims extended along the continuum of the duties to respect, to protect, or to fulfil, with their progressive impact on the respective state resources. In addition to establishing connections between a number of human rights, as noted above, some advocates have employed a strategy of including within their claims detailed examples of alternatives to the treatment of people suffering housing rights violations (with considered input from relevant community members, architects or examples from other jurisdictions), for the court's consideration, therefore making it easier for courts to comprehend the parameters and viability of the remedy sought, rather than expecting the court to design new policy itself. <fnote>Langford, above no 31, 18. </fnote><fnote>Scott Leckie, 'The Right to Housing' in Asbjørn Eide, Catarina Krause and Allan Rosas (eds), Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2nd ed, 2001) 153-158. </fnote><fnote>Langford, above no 31, ch 3. </fnote>Further, housing rights advocates have identified the implementation of court orders as the most essential, but most problematic, task in ensuring that litigation is ultimately effective in ensuring practical impact for local communities and therefore a successful translation of the international standard to daily realities. This was demonstrated in the Grootboom case, where, following its successful outcome, the difficulty lay in the task of ensuring the realisation of the court's orders through appropriate and vigilant monitoring.  <fnote>Ibid, 17. </fnote><fnote>Ibid, 9. </fnote><heading>Relevance of Complementary Strategies</heading>In addition to seeking the appropriate framing of judicial remedies, namely supervisory rather than declaratory orders, housing rights advocates have emphasised the importance of implementing the court's orders in conjunction with complementary non-litigious strategies, in particular, a "public or political campaign or the intense involvement of the affected communities". As litigation alone has been shown not to have the capacity to address all housing rights issues, placing the application of international norms in domestic courts within a wider political strategy has proven to provide a more holistic approach to, and ultimately greater success in, the correction of violations of housing rights.  <fnote>Ibid 18. </fnote><fnote>Ibid 17. In this regard, it is important to look to domestic institutions which are able to effectively adjudicate and enforce economic, social and cultural rights as well as coordinating complementary strategies. See generally: Philip Lynch, 'Harmonising International Human Rights Law and Domestic Law and Policy: the Establishment and Role of the Human Rights Law Resource Centre' (2006) 7 Melbourne Journal of International Law 225. </fnote>Where cases fail, housing issues or broader social movements surrounding them may suffer a setback from obstructive legal precedents. Further, opportunities for direct action may be forfeited and communities may suffer the consequences of false hope. However, a successful judgment with failed implementation may result in less long-term practical benefit for local communities than an approach involving complementary strategies, even where the litigious aspect disappoints. Housing rights advocates contend that combining litigation with a complementary social mobilisation strategy, including media campaigns and political lobbying, will generally act to lessen the detrimental consequences of unsuccessful cases as the litigious effort and negative judgment, if publicised appropriately, may act as a catalyst for more nuanced future cases which enjoy greater support from communities and advocates, as well as political change even without the originally desired legal outcome.  <fnote>Langford, above no 31, 25. </fnote><heading>CONCLUSION</heading>The purpose of this essay was to examine one of the human rights strategies applied by housing rights advocates in a domestic setting, namely the use of the international right to housing in domestic courts, in order to consider the potential for this strategy to effect practical benefit for housing conditions at the local level. The discussion above reveals that this approach has yielded some very successful outcomes and, even in circumstances where the actual legal outcome was not favourable, the strength and authoritative nature of the international human rights regime lends weight to the legitimacy of housing rights in local settings generally. This is particularly enhanced when combined with a complementary social mobilisation movement in relation to the particular issues. Accordingly, housing rights advocates would be wise to consider this as a central strategy, where appropriate in the circumstances, but at the very least, a significant component of their wider housing rights campaigns.
