<heading>Referral information Source of referral and a summary of key information</heading>48 year old gentleman admitted on  for an elective day-case angiogram due to a 16 month history of palpitations and feeling 'not-quite-right'. <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background. The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading><heading>Presenting complaint:</heading>Palpitations and a general feeling of being 'not quite right'. <heading>History of presenting complaint:</heading>The palpitations started 16 months ago and occurred early morning, soon after getting up. The palpitations were felt in the left upper sternal area and lasted for approximately 30 seconds to a minute. During these episodes, the patient is distressed because he is aware of what he described as feeling like someone is drilling into his chest. There is a preceding feeling of faintness, but there is no associated chest pain or dyspnoea with these episodes and they occur during exercise and at rest. The patient has been able to associate excessive alcohol the previous night as a trigger for these episodes. These palpitations had started to become more frequent until this July the patient went to the hospital due to feelings of dreadfulness, he could not explain these further apart from stating he had felt tired all the time just prior to this episode. This visit to the hospital triggered further investigations, which included a 24-hour ECG, and echocardiogram both of which did not show any evidence of an arrhythmia. However, the patient then did an exercise tolerance test, which had to be stopped at stage II due to superventricular tachycardia. <heading>Past medical history:</heading>Previous investigations revealed Mr  has hypercholestrolaemia and hypertension No previous history of an MI, CVA, diabetes, RF, asthma or epilepsy The patient does suffer from certain food and stress-induced migraines Appendectomy at age 11 <heading>Family history:</heading>Father had 2 MI's at the age of 59, still alive Brother died at age 40 from an MI Mum suffers from migraines <heading>Drug history and allergies:</heading><list><heading>NKDA</heading>Aspirin 75mg OD - anti-plateletSimvastatin 20mg OD - HMG-CoA inhibitorBisoprolol 2.5mg OD - Î² blockerRamipril 2.5mg OD - ACE inhibitor</list><heading>Social history:</heading>Mr  is a material scientist. He is separated from his wife and has a partner who lives in . He has one daughter who lives in . The patient until recently has been very active and goes hill-walking regularly. In the recent past Mr  consumed upwards of 60 units of alcohol a week, recently this has been cut down to 21 units a week. He is an ex-smoker who stopped last year and has a 8 pack-year history due to smoking 5 cigars a day from the age of 18 - 47 <heading>Systems review:</heading>A systems review revealed nothing of note. <heading>Analysis of history The most likely single cause of the presentation, other possible causes and reasons for these choices. The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>Hyperthyroidism can cause palpitations, however, this cause would have been already identified in earlier admissions if this was the cause. Anaemia can cause ventricular ectopics, again this would have already been identified. Psychological element; Mr  stated that he does suffer from stress and this can cause palpitations and could be exacerbating the current situation. Electrolyte imbalance (low serum K+ or Mg+) can cause ventricular tachycardia and needs to be looked at further. There is no recent history of vomiting or diarrhoea, which makes this diagnosis less likely. Excess caffeine/alcohol can cause either or junctional tachycardias/ventricular ectopics/alcoholic cardiomyopathy. The reported alcohol intake by Mr  and reported trigger of excess alcohol the preceding evening, would indicate that alcohol could be a cause for this presentation. Dilated cardiomyopathy can cause tachycardia, ventricular ectopic beats and AF. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) - A rare form of cardiomyopathy, which can cause ventricular tachycardia and can be the presenting feature. Diagnosis of ARVD can often be difficult and the diagnosis is based on investigations including ECG, echo, myocardial biopsy and the gold standard investigation an MRI scan [1]. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading>A slim man who was sitting comfortably on the bed No evidence of clubbing, peripheral cyanosis, splinter haemorrhages, xanthomata, palmar erythema or dupuytren's contracture on his hands. Pulse = 60 bpm and irregularly irregular, BP 122/70, RR = 16, O 2 sats = 100% on air, apyrexial No evidence of jaundice, anaemia, central cyanosis, oedema or lymphadenopathy JVP was not raised On examination of the chest there were 4 spider naevi evident superior to the nipples, nothing else of note. <heading>Palpation :</heading>No left or right parasternal heaves or palpable thrills. The apex beat was located in the 5 th ICS MCL. <heading>Auscultation:</heading>Heart sound I + II heard with no added sounds Respiratory - vesicular breathing evident in all areas with no added sounds. Abdominal examination - the abdomen was soft and non-tender on soft and deep palpation. There was no evidence of masses, organomegaly or ascites. On auscultation there were bowel sounds present in all four quadrants. Neurological - no abnormalities found on gross examination. <heading>Analysis of history and examination Reasons for your choice of the cause of the patient's problem(s) and any other cause that still needs to be considered at this stage</heading>There was no evidence of hyperthyroidism, anaemia or dehydration on examination, which makes hyperthyroidsim, anaemia, and low K+ or Mg+ less likely as the primary cause of the episodes of VT. However, these conditions could exacerbate the primary cause and TSH, T3/T4, FBC and electrolyte levels need to be checked on routine blood tests. Excess caffeine/alcohol can cause either or junctional tachycardias/ventricular ectopics/alcoholic cardiomyopathy. The reported alcohol intake by Mr  and the admission that these events occur the morning after a heavy night, still indicate that alcohol could be the primary cause for this presentation. Dilated cardiomyopathy can cause tachycardia, ventricular ectopic beats and AF, an echocardiogram will be able to assess the likelihood of this diagnosis. ARVD cannot be ruled out at this stage as diagnosis is based on investigations not on clinical examination of the patient. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>The patient was quite an anxious man who has had a history of alcohol abuse, which was probably higher than he stated. His partner, who was present during the history, intimated that the estimate of 60 units per week was a conservative one. This history of alcohol abuse and recent need to cut down his alcohol intake will be impacting on him socially, psychologically and physically, if the reason for his presentation is due to alcohol. The episodes of severe palpitations that he has been experiencing has been upsetting to him and he has stated that he is an anxious man and these episodes of uncontrollable palpitations will be increasing his anxiety levels, which in turn could increase the number of episodes he experiences. This vicious cycle and general feeling of not being in control of his body will have a global impact on his lifestyle. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management.

After each investigation, the results were explained to him. The results of the ETT were explained immediately after the test and before the angiogram. Possible reasons for the episodes of VT as well as why the angiogram was being carried out were explained. Mr  knew the angiogram was to highlight any underlying coronary artery disease, which could be stented that would explain the episodes of VT. Especially with the strong positive family history, past history of smoking, high cholesterol/triglycerides and hypertension. <heading>Prescription/medical intervention</heading>Mr  is already on the medications recommended to reduce ischaemic coronary episodes. Additional anti-arrhythmic drugs might be necessary if the episodes of VT continue. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator might be indicated if further episodes of VT are difficult to manage medically. <heading>Observation</heading>Mr  was observed and monitored on an ECG while on CCU pre- and post- angiogram to ensure no further episodes of VT occurred. <heading>Referral and team working</heading>The referral involved A&E, Consultant cardiologist and team, cardiac investigations technicians, radiograghers, specialist nurses, HCAs, pharmacist, GP <heading>Advice and prevention</heading>Mr  was told that the most likely reason for his episodes of palpitations were due to his excess alcohol consumption. He was strongly advised to cut down with the intention of stopping. This measure would stop any further alcoholic cardiomyopathy and progression of the problem. He was told to seek advice/help from his GP if he experienced further episodes. <heading>Outcome</heading>A description of the progress of the patient as far as possible. This should include consideration of further issues to be resolved. Where appropriate you should contact by telephone patients who have been discharged home. The prognosis of the patient will very much depend on how well he is able to curb his drinking habits. The management is one of watching and waiting with appropriate advice to the patient if a further episode occurs. If these episodes do not diminish with reduced alcohol intake then further medical or surgical management may need to be considered in the guise of anti-arrhythmic drugs or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. <heading>Evidence based care and issues for research</heading>A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s) One study has shown that patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy, who abstain from alcohol, or control their drinking to less than 60g of ethanol per day (four standard drinks), improved their cardiac function [5]. Individuals with mild manifestations of cardiac dysfunction who stop all alcohol consumption can markedly improve their prognosis and even return to normal cardiac function [6]. However, caution has to be made with withdrawal of alcohol as atrial arrhythmias have been shown to occur during the early ethanol withdrawal phase in patients without other clinical evidence of heart disease [7]. There are few papers in the literature regarding the diagnosis and management of SVT due to alcoholic cardiomyopathy. It Mr  does not stop having these episodes of ectopics and SVT with his abstention from alcohol, then other possible causes need to be investigated. An interesting recent paper on the use of radiofrequency catheter ablation for a tachycardiomyopathy on a 26 year old female, described the successful treatment on a phenomenon that is rarely diagnosed. This female presented with an incessant supraventricular tachycardia, which was not reversible with electrical cardioversion. Echocardiogram showed a severe LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction. After ablation her left ventricular function returned to normal. This case shows that early treatment for tachycardiomyopathy - considered the most frequently unrecognised curable cause of heart failure - can prevent irreversible structural cardiac damage [8]. <heading>Commentary</heading>A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem Ventricular tachycardia is associated with underlying coronary, ischaemic, or hypertension, as well as, cardiomyopathies (dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive) [2]. The underlying mechanism is thought to be enhanced automaticity, leading to re-entry circuit as in other tachycardias. In VT there is a group of ischaemic or electrically non-homogeneous cells. Excessive alcohol consumption is one of the commonest causes of dilated cardiomyopathy in the Western world. Myocardial damage may arise by three basic mechanisms: <list>Direct toxic effects of alcoholNutritional deficiencies, particularly thiamine deficiencyToxic effects of additives (e.g. cobalt) in alcoholic beverages</list>Stopping alcohol consumption can halt the progression of the disease and in some cases can improve ventricular function [3]. Medical management of VT is most commonly with amiodarone or Ã blockers. <heading>Impact on your learning</heading>Describe what you have learnt from this case Presentation, differential diagnosis, subsequent investigations and management of tachyarrhythmias.
