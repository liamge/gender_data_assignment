This report has been divided into 2 parts: <list>1 st part: Analysis of reducing sugars by the Lane and Eynon method (Volumetric)2 nd part: Use of polarimetry to determine sucrose concentration</list><heading>1st PART</heading><heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>Lane and Eynon method is used for the determination of reducing sugars only. A burette is used to add the carbohydrate solution being analyzed to a flask containing a known amount of boiling copper sulfate solution and a methylene blue indicator. The reducing sugars in the carbohydrate solution react with the copper sulfate present in the flask. Once all the copper sulfate in solution has reacted, any further addition of reducing sugars causes the indicator to change from blue to red. The volume of sugar solution required to reach the end point is recorded. <heading>METHOD</heading>The method was completed after following the instructions of the Laboratory handout, without any alterations. <heading>RESULTS - CALCULATIONS</heading>Determination of reducing sugar in solution (Standard Method) Titration Result: 24.7 ml of sugar solution  FORMULA  Preparation of jam solution and determination of reducing sugars in jam  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>DISCUSSION</heading>The disadvantages of the Lane and Eynon method are (i) the results depend on the precise reaction times, temperatures and reagent concentrations used and so these parameters must be carefully controlled; (ii) it cannot distinguish between different types of reducing sugar, and (iii) it cannot directly determine the concentration of non-reducing sugars, (iv) it is susceptible to interference from other types of molecules that act as reducing agents.. Limitations due to the uncertainty of the instruments also exist but we consider them as not significant when doing our calculations. <heading>2nd PART</heading><heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>Molecules that contain an asymmetric carbon atom have the ability to rotate plane polarized light. A polarimeter is a device that measures the angle that plane polarized light is rotated on passing through a solution. A polarimeter consists of a source of monochromatic light, a polarizer, a sample cell of known length, and an analyzer to measure the angle of rotation. The extent of polarization is related to the concentration of the optically active molecules in solution by the equation ]lc, where  is the measured angle of rotation, [] is the optical activity (which is a constant for each type of molecule), l is the pathlength and c is the concentration. The overall angle of rotation depends on the temperature and wavelength of light used. <figure/><heading>METHOD</heading>The method was completed after following the instructions of the Laboratory handout, without any alterations. <heading>RESULTS - CALCULATIONS</heading><figure/> FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  The standard equation for specific rotation is:  FORMULA  Where: a obs is the observed rotation c is the concentration (g/100 ml) l is the cell length (dm) = 2 dm in this instrument [a]20D for sucrose is + 66.50 o [a]20D for invert sugars is -19.80 o For sucrose before inversion:  FORMULA  For sucrose after inversion:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  342 g sucrose gives 360 g invert sugars, since sucrose has a relative molecular mass of 342 and invert sugars have a relative molecular mass of 360. Therefore change in  FORMULA  So 2.91 mg are in 100 ml of a diluted sample (50 ml sample) In 100 ml sample the concentration of sucrose would be:  FORMULA  <heading>DISCUSSION</heading>A common error in the polarimetric method is to have air bubbles in the tube of the polarimeter, which will distort the results. Limitations due to the uncertainty of the instruments also exist but we consider them as not significant when doing our calculations.
