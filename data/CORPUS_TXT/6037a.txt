<heading>Introduction</heading>The aim of the experiment was to determine the total acidity of vinegar. The titration in the experiment involved standardisation of NaOH. This was because NaOH was hygroscopic and absorbed carbon dioxide so could not be used as a primary standard. NaOH was standardised against potassium hydrogen phthalate. <heading>Method </heading>For details of both methods see practical schedule. No alterations were made to the method. <heading>Preparation of standard sodium hydroxide solution. </heading>The sodium hydroxide was titrated against 25ml of potassium hydrogen phthalate and phenolphthalein indicator. The alkali was added until a permanent faint pink colour end point was reached. From this experiment the molarity of the sodium hydroxide was calculated. <heading>Determination of the total acidity of vinegar. </heading>25ml of the vinegar sample was pipetted and diluted up to 100ml in a volumetric flask. The 0.1M sodium hydroxide was then titrated with 25ml of the diluted vinegar sample and a few drops of phenolphthalein indicator was added. The pH of the three vinegar samples were determined using pH paper. Also barium chloride and silver nitrate solution were added to diluted samples of vinegar and observations were recorded. <heading>Results</heading>Preparation of standard sodium hydroxide solution. <table/>Three titre within ±0.1 ml.

Sample 3 had the strongest acidity at 6.87%, and then sample 1 with 4.59% and sample was the weakest with only 2.42% acetic acid. Vinegar samples 1 and 3 would meet the legal standard because for both fermented and artificial products the minimum amount of acetic acid is 4% m/V. Sample 2 did not meet the legal standard as it contained only 2.42% m/V acetic acid. The pH of the three vinegar sample ranged from pH 1.0 - 3.0. Sample 3 had the lowest pH of 1.0. This sample was also the gave a positive creamy white precipitate with silver nitrate solution. This suggested that the sample may have been contaminated with a mineral acid. Mineral acids, i.e H 2SO 4 and HCl have a high dissociation constant. i.e. HCl → H+ + Cl- ( lots of H+) (This reaction is reversible but the forward reaction is favourable.) However, organic acids, i.e. CH 3COOH have a poor dissociation constant. i.e. CH 3COOH ← CH 3COO- + H+ ( less H+) (Also a reversible reaction but the backward reaction is favoured.) Since the pH = -log [H+], mineral acids have a low pH between 1-2, whereas organic acids have a higher pH between pH 3-4. Sample 3 therefore was contaminated with a mineral acid, HCl as the test for chloride ions is silver nitrate and it was positive. The effect of relatively large amounts of phenolphthalein indicator on the results obtained would be change volume of solution so titration value would be slightly inaccurate. It may also be because indicators are either weak acids or alkali so you are changing the concentration of the vinegar. If the vinegar were more strongly coloured the end point may be determined by using a pH meter? Sources of error The main sources of error were in determining the end point of the titration. It was very difficult to get the exact end point because the colour change happened very quickly, in just one drop
