<heading>Introduction:</heading>In this investigation a sample of food, in this case ham, is to be examined for Staphylococcus aureus. Staphlococci was first identified by a Scottish surgeon in 1882 as the cause of a number of infections. The enumeration of Staphylococcus aureus has long been established and there are many different methods in which a count of colonies may be obtained. Traditional methods use a selective medium to isolate and grow the S.aureus cultures. The selective medium used for this purpose is Baird Parker (BP) agar. Baird Parker agar contains components such as lithium chloride which inhibit the growth of many micro-organisms. The growth of S.aureus is then promoted with components such as pyruvates and glycine which selectively stimulate the growth of the required organism. More recent techniques use bioluminescence assays in the detection of S.aureus. <enote>Adams M.R. and Moss M.O (2000), Food Microbiology 2nd Edition, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, p 253 </enote><enote> URL  (29/02/2004) </enote>Staphylococcus aureus has long been associated with inadequate personal hygiene in food preparation areas. This is due to the fact that the S.aureus is found in the mucous membrane of the nose of a significant proportion of the population. This means that it can easily be transferred to food by people who touch their nose during food preparation. With food preparation, however, it should be noted that mucous membrane of the nose is one of the few sources of S.aureus. It should therefore be possible to practically eliminate this micro-organism from food products if good hand-washing regimes are followed. In lots of food production companies' staff will be tested regularly for the presence of S.aureus on their hands (particularly under finger nails). In some cases the absence of S.aureus will results in some sort of bonus at the end of each month. There are many different sort of Staphylococcus which will be isolated and grow on the BP agar. Therefore, to confirm whether S.aureus has been isolated, a further step is required. There are many S.aureus identification techniques made by various companies but most work on an agglutination technique. For the purpose of this investigation the 'Staphtect plus' technique will be used. This uses latex which reacts with part of the S.aureus and causes agglutination to occur. <heading>Method:</heading>The method was followed as described in the 'Microbiological Hazards in Foods (Module FB2 FM2) Laboratory Schedule. To summarise, however, the following procedure was followed; <enote>Owens, Dr J.D, Microbiological Hazards in Foods - Laboratory Schedule, p2-1 to 5-6. </enote>25g ham was placed into a stomacher bag to which 225ml MRD was added. This was then homogenised by stomaching for 1 minute. The solids in the suspension were then allowed to settle out before 10ml was transferred aseptically to a sterile bottle. Four Baird Parker (BP) plates were then labelled with the appropriate information. To each of these a volume of the prepared solution was added (0.3ml on two plates, 0.4ml on one plate and 0.1ml on the final plate). It should be ensured that each plate is clearly labelled as to the volume of solution added. The plates were then incubated at 37°C±1°C and examined after 24 and 48 hours. After a count of presumptive positive S.aureus colonies (black with a clear halo surround) had been obtained, presumptive colonies were tested using the 'Staphtect Plus' agglutination technique, the results of which are recorded below. <heading>Results:</heading><heading>Plate count</heading><table/><heading>'Staphtect plus' agglutination results</heading><figure/><heading>Discussion:</heading>From the result it can be seen that the sample of ham contained 1.58×10 2 colonies per gram of sample. It is generally stated that an infective dose is reached when there is a population of greater than 10 5 S.aureus organisms per gram of food. The sample of food should therefore pose no risk of S.aureus contamination to anyone who decided to consume it (although coliforms and a total viable count cannot be accounted for from the test performed). On food samples produced from manufacturers it should be expected that there would be no S.aureus organisms' present within the sample. Looking at the results of the 'Staphtect plus' agglutination test it can be seen that none of the samples tested, agglutinated the control. This means that any agglutination that occurred can be related to the presence of S.aureus (i.e. the test works). S.epidermis was used as a negative control and it can be seen that the test part of this procedure gave a negative result. This too is as expected as the 'Staphtect plus' test is designed only to give positive results for S.aureus - it can therefore be assumed that any positive results in the test obtained are S.aureus. It can be seen from looking at the diagram above that the S.aureus and suspect positive were the only tests to agglutinate the latex. It can therefore be determined that the Staphylococcus isolated from the food sample was S.aureus. For an area of further study it could be interesting to try and determine where the S.aureus that contaminated the ham came from. This sort of test would probably be done on site of a ham producer and if this was the case it would be interesting to go back and try to determine at what stage the ham was becoming contaminated. <heading>Questions:</heading>With the procedure used; a dilution of 10 -1 and 0.1ml of solution spread on to the plate, it would be possible to enumerate between 300 and 3000 S.aureus colonies per gram of food sample. This is because on an ideal plate, between 30 and 300 colonies are needed for a reliable count and 0.1ml (therefore multiply this value by 10 to get value into 1ml). If higher dilutions were used it would be possible to enumerate the level of S.aureus to a far greater extent. The initial dilution is: = FORMULA  Second dilution =  FORMULA  Therefore, total dilution =  FORMULA  And, total dilution factor =  FORMULA  <table/>Therefore, it should be reported that there are 5.75×10 3 S.aureus colonies per gram of the food sample that was tested (a latex agglutination test should be performed to confirm the isolation of S.aureus).
