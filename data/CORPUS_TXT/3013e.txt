<heading>1. Introduction</heading>This report consists of a detailed analysis of the departmental profit and loss report, suggesting alternatives to cut costs or increase profit, taking into thought the significance of the variance figures and percentages. A general analysis of the front page P&L will be related to the departmental statements and its consequences and influences put forth. Finally, an evaluation of the Balance Sheet and relevant Ratios is also taken into account. A higher importance will be given to variable costs, as when it comes to decision-making, it is more functional to bear in mind controllable costs, due to fixed costs being mostly altered because of external factors which are beyond the handling of the hotel (Adams, 1997). <heading>2. Departmental Profit and Loss Analysis</heading><heading>2.1 Rooms Department</heading><heading>2.1.1 Introduction</heading>The accommodation section is the department within the hotel which has a higher contribution to the general financial performance of the hotel. Therefore, rooms' management statistics are normally considered as providing an overview of how the hotel is progressing. The most common way of assessing the rooms department performance is by taking into account measures of price and volume, such as the average room rate (related to price) and room occupancy (regarding volume). Other measures such as bed-occupancy or double-bed occupancy provide a more detailed analysis of the general performance (Chin et al, 1995). <heading>2.1.2 Sales</heading>The volume of sales, in this case, is relatively important for reasons mentioned above. Being a medium-sized hotel, the amount of variable costs may be superior to fixed costs meaning a lower prevalence of fixed costs per room, hence having a direct positive influence on departmental profit. (Kotas & Conlan, 1999) When analysing the ratios related to room occupancy and average room rate in order to assess the department's general performance, it is clear to see, that occupancy has risen by 5.7 % and the A.R.R. has lowered £0.36. Although this variance in terms of price may seem unimportant, in a long term point of view, and allied to a higher occupancy, it has a direct increasing influence on departmental sales, and consequently departmental profit. It is important to be aware of the trend of this ratio as other factors such as sales objectives (selling more expensive rooms than economical ones) can influence it (Jagels & Coltman, 2004) The RevPar is also an important figure as it calculates the revenue generated per available room and therefore combines the hotels occupancy percentage and its A.R.R. and demonstrates how the hotel's overall performance is in comparison to its highest revenue potential. In this case, it shows that by having a lower A.R.R (£31.93) the hotel increases its occupancy (80.7%) and consequently it RevPar (£25.78), making more use of its facilities. These figures are important, for the hotel to concentrate on which market segment its product is orientated and therefore, focus its marketing tactics (Chin et al, 1995). The yield figure shows how much of the rooms are being sold at lower rates than premium. In this case, it is possible to note, that although the hotels, A.R.R has come down, the RevPar has increased, meaning that less rooms budgeted are being sold at lower rates (Chin et al, 1995). <heading>2.1.3 Payroll</heading>The actual payroll is higher than budgeted; however, since benefits did not increase (knowing that every employee hired has a right to benefits) and being such a small variance, this may be due to a total rewards system, which may possibly contain overtime payment, bonuses, sick pay or performance related pay (Goldsmith et al, 1997). On the other hand, the percentage of actual payroll has decreased in comparison to budget and this may be due to the increase in sales. The payroll cost percentage shows how much of the sales are spent on salaries and benefits and the variance percentage corresponds to the £25 increases which was noted in actual payroll. <heading>2.1.4 Departmental Expenses</heading>Some hotels have contracts with travel agencies where they give commissions depending on number of nights and length of stay of the customers. In this case and as occupancy has risen, it is probable that many of the customers are from such travel agencies (note that the percentage of commissions compared to sales are the same, both in actual and budget figures) and therefore the hotel has to pay more commissions than predicted. With regards to linen and laundry, the hotel may have a policy which states that bed sheets are only changed after a guest's check - out. If the minimum LOS has increased, housekeeping staff have to change bed linen less frequently, impacting directly on a laundry costs. It is a common practice in the hospitality industry for staff to consume products intended strictly for the customers (Burgess, 2001); this may relate to food and, beverage, or guest supplies. The hotel can only raise awareness about the consequences of such acts, as legal action would only seem only advisable if such procedures came to an extreme. Other expenses include all undistributed and minor expenses accounted for, not specifying where and what they belong to. The Undistributed Costs per Available Room is a good way of controlling variable costs, as it shows how much of the costs are incurred in each room. In the case of the hotel, these have gone up, when compared to budget and therefore, actions must be taken to determine the "why" and management much seek to decrease them (Chin et al, 1995). <heading>2.1.5 Departmental Profit</heading>The increase of actual profit is the result of all the subsequent changes in the P&L. When minor increases and changes add up, the figures will change quite considerably; the rise in sales and the decrease in linen and laundry, compensate the rise in credit card commissions and prove that modifications in variable costs do have an overall influence on the departments' financial performance. Some ratios are applicable to all departments; therefore those will be explained in this section only: The profit per customer is a good indicator of how much revenue is generated by each customer and in this case it has case, representing a situation to be investigated, if revenue it to be increased. Payroll Cost p/ Av. Room and Departmental Expenses p/ Av. Room are very similar ratios which indicate costs incurred on each guest. They show how much of the priced charged on the customers will relate to those costs. Although all costs are included in Total Cost p/ Av. Room ratio, they have been separated to allow management the correct analysis and hence, the appropriate measures to reduce such costs. Payroll cost ratio is relatively important because payroll constitutes a high cost, especially in the following department (sometimes unnecessarily) and this ratio will clarify how much staff costs per customer (Riley, 2000). As these ratios will be repeated in the following departments, although with different figures, their explanation will not be gone over. <heading>2.1.6 Conclusion</heading>It is crucial to regard both costs and revenues, and variances in terms of percentages and money. Analysing percentages helps pin-point the problem (Burgess, 2001). In the rooms department, there is an increase of 6.4% in sales, whilst costs have risen 2.6%. It is also important to note, where, within the costs, there are high variances. There is an increase of 8.5% between actual and budgeted travel agent commissions, followed by 7.0% in guest supplies and a decline of 6.1 % in linen and laundry. It is important to note that a variance which indicates a decrease may have both positive and negative effects being the duty of the manager to identify and justify occurring gaps (Burgess, 2001). The advantage of the departmental P&L is that by separating all costs and determining the marginal costs, there is the possibility of efficient and effective measures to reduce high costs (Chin et al 1995). <heading>2.2 Food and Beverage Department</heading><heading>2.2.1 Introduction</heading>Food and beverage factors to evaluate performance are quite similar to the rooms department, meaning they focus on volume and price. Seat turnover and the average spend per customer are the most used measures to assess F&B performance (Chin et al 1995). <heading>2.2.1 Sales</heading>The increase in occupancy, and hence, number of guests in the hotel may be a cause for the raise in F&B sales, when compared to the budget; also, a change in menu items or a more detailed menu engineering (Fattorini, 2001)-possibly rising the inclusion of dishes with a higher contribution margin-may have the same effects, as well product - bundle pricing, where many products are joined and sold at a cheaper price (Kotler et al, 2003). Additionally, if managers want to further increase sales, and consequently revenue, it may be necessary to implement actions in order to raise the percentage of beverage sales, as these items are a fast way of increasing revenue (Fattorini, 2001). <heading>2.2.2 Cost of Sales</heading>It is in this department that costs are higher than other sections as all raw materials must be considered, and managers must try to keep costs adequate, as a large decrease in costs may have negative consequences, connected to a decline in quality (Chin et al 1995). Cost of sales has also risen, when compared to budget, almost in the same proportion as the increase of sales. It is clear to notice, that when sales rise, there is a larger need of raw material and therefore costs will relatively increase as well. In this situation, seat turnover cannot be calculated, as the number of seats available is not provided, however it is possible to compare average spends per cover, concluding that food spend per cover has risen, however, beverage spend has decreased. Managers may concentrate on increasing beverage spends, controlling beverage costs and working on an even higher increase in sales. Unnecessary wastage caused by carelessness in calculating correct quantities of food items or inappropriate attitudes of staff towards food (Brugess, 2001) destined to customers may be reasons justifying an increase in average food spend. The av. spend per cover allows the hotel to identify which products and areas are generating more revenue (Burgess, 2001). In this situation, customers are spending more money on food than budgeted and less on beverage. The above is also directly related to the percentage of beverage sales to food sales; knowing that drinks are always more profitable than food, it is important for the managers to put into action strategies to increase this percentage and hence, revenue (Jagels & Coltman, 2004). Fatorrini (2001) suggests increasing prices on less expensive beverages instead of more expensive ones, which can also be applied to food. This will help maintain a smaller margin on pricey drinks and at the same time, keep them appealing to the customers whilst compensating the difference through the cheaper beverages. However, this is very price - orientated and a market-orientated approach would be using a menu engineering matrix, and evaluating popularity as well as the contribution margin. <heading>2.2.3 Departmental Expenses</heading>With regards to other departmental expenses, these has experienced minor changes, which in terms of money variance, may have little or no value, however, when comparing percentages, some amount of attention is required and should be put in defining specific measures, as these constitute variable costs, hence, are internally controllable. Special consideration should be given to china, glass and silver, and to menus, as these have the biggest variance percentages (10.3% and 7.8% respectively). By determining the causes that led to such an increase, managers are able to apply the correct procedures, and control the situation. <heading>2.2.4 Departmental Profit</heading>Although variable costs have grown accordingly to the increase in sales, the rise of cost of sales has caused the actual gross profit percentage to be lower than budgeted (65.9% actual as opposed to 67.1% budgeted), while the actual GP (in terms of money) is higher than the budget. On the one hand, payroll has suffered no modification, therefore, possibly influencing the rise in profit; on the other hand, there have been slight increases in all departmental expenses apart from F&B Supplies (which has decreased 2.0%). These small increases and the particular decrease have contributed to a positive departmental performance, resulting in a final increase of 73.8% of profit. The average covers ratio indicates how many covers were sold per meal period, and can contribute to the turnover rate. The higher the number of meals served the better, as long as standards of service and quality are maintained (Jagels & Coltman, 2004). The average customers per day and per hour also give an overview of how many customers are being served. It is important to note, that these figures should be analysed with turnover and managers must understand the causes of alteration in theses figures. In this case, the numbers have increased in comparison to budget, and managers must seize this opportunity to apply schemes to maintain such levels. <heading>2.2.5 Conclusion</heading>The F&B Profit and Loss report is a good indicator of why it is important to analyse both figures and percentages, as sometimes, the figures may indicate an increase in profit, however, when analysing the percentages and variances the manager notices that such are not what they seem (Burgess, 2001). Gross Profit figures are higher than budget, however the percentage is lower, showing that the impact of the cost of sales is greater than calculated, and in a long-term point of view may become highly prejudicial to the hotel. It also allows the manager to define where the problem lies and develop strategies to lower food cost to balance out the total costs, or alternatively, cut costs in both food and beverage proportionally to reach the necessary consistency and stability. <heading>2.3 Sundry Department</heading><heading>2.3.1 Introduction</heading>The sundry department considers all other departments which are not big enough and do not have enough transactions to have a separate P&L. They mostly include facilities which the hotels. It is important to carefully analyse this section as it shows how accepted the organizations services are, within the customers (Chin et al, 1995). The factors which are most applied to measure performance in such departments are revenue per occupied room and average spend per customer. The figures provided by these departments are useful in suggesting which areas managers should concentrate on when establishing marketing plans and aiming to improve sales. In this case, the facility stated on the sundry department is the telephone, and it is one which may cause some controversy as the tariffs charged by hotels are very high as they also have costs to cover; therefore most customers choose alternative forms of communication such as their own mobile phone or calling cards. The problem with calling cards is that the guest still uses the phone provided by the hotel, so as a measure to reduce the incidence of such actions, some hotels either charge a rate for the usage of the telephone or do not allow calling cards. The logical consequence is that guests may not like such tactics and subsequently, not come back (Chin et al, 1995). The bare truth is that, small establishments have more fixed costs than variable ones, and therefore, a rise in sales causes a growth in profit (Kotas & Conlan, 1997). One thing hotels could do is cut down telephone costs, allowing a higher margin of profit (Chin et al, 1995). <heading>2.3.2 Sales</heading>Telephone sales have gone up 4.6%, when compared to budget, possibly due to a higher occupancy rate and length of stay, however, the rise is not considerable, proving that many guests will opt for other forms of communication. <heading>2.3.3 Cost of Sales</heading>The cost of sales is directly proportional to sales. Both telephone sales and cost of sales have a variance of 4.6%, showing that possibly the increase of cost of sales is due to the increase in telephone sales <heading>2.3.4 Gross Profit</heading>The actual gross profit is higher than budgeted; on the contrary, the percentage related to actual gross profit is lower than budget. This may be caused by the difference in figures between the actual and budgeted cost of sales, which will directly influence the result (in money) of the gross profit and its proportion to total sales, altering likewise the variance between the two amounts of gross profit. <heading>2.3.5 Departmental Expenses</heading>There is only a decrease of £5 in undistributed expenses, which although seeming insignificant represents a variance of 10%. The same difference will be automatically noticed on total expenses, which though corresponding to, again a decrease of £5, now represents a 2.5% variance, possibly suggesting that the smaller the figures, the higher the percentages of variance will be, although relating to the same amount of money. <heading>2.3.6 Departmental Profit</heading>The increase in departmental profit is mainly due to the increase in sales and cost of sales and the decline in other expenses. Although the difference in profit is £60, it represents 5.7% increase of actual profit, when compared to budgeted figures. <heading>2.4 Administration Department</heading><heading>2.4.1 Introduction</heading>This department is, on the contrary of the above, a "cost centre", meaning it has no profit (Burgess, 2001). It normally includes costs such as maintenance, energy, sales and marketing, payrolls related to staff working in the administration section, and additional non-distributed costs (Chin et al, 1995). <heading>2.4.2 Payroll</heading>In this situation, payroll and benefits are over budget, and the variance shows it is a significant value (£295). This may be due to a situation which forced the hotel to hire someone (in the administration department) who wasn't budgeted for; also, there is the possibility of an employee on maternity leave or being sick, causing extra costs and an excess of workload for the remaining staff, including possibly the need of overtime labour. <heading>2.4.3 Departmental Costs</heading>The actual figures of recruitment and training are much lower than what was budgeted representing a decrease of 17.5% and £105. Knowing that these are controllable costs, there are many possibilities for such an alteration, possibly, a general decrease in number of recruited staff, hence, less expenses to train them, or simply a change in training techniques in order to cut down avoidable costs. Also, there may be a possibility that the budget was wrongly calculated, consequently attributing inexistent needless expenses. Some hotels have contracts with credit card companies, where these receive a percentage of the total sales (1%) meaning that, the quantity paid to such companies is directly related to the number of credit card transactions. Although actual total sales have risen in comparison to budget, the actual figures of credit card commissions are lower than budgeted, meaning that guests preferred to set their bills through alternative ways, e.g. cash, cheque or cards with which the hotel has no stipulated % of commission to pay. The sales and marketing costs have increased 16.3% in relation to budget; knowing that the room occupancy has increased, it is likely that strategies thought of in order to increase occupancy and sales, where put into practice, and being a difference of £195, there is a chance that the hotel invested more in its publicity campaign with the aim of increasing its occupancy and revenue figures. Furthermore, the hotel may have spent more on its policies and schemes to follow the established marketing plan, and reach its determined objectives, whilst cutting variable expenses in other departments. The utility expenses are less than budget, however, the difference in money is rather low (£25), reflecting in a variance of 1.9%, therefore, it does not seem that there will be a significant impact on the final results. The same happens with the maintenance and repair costs, where there is only a decrease of £10 and 0.8%, in relation to budget, and the undistributed costs diminishing £25, corresponding to 2.5% of variance. <heading>2.4.6 Departmental Cost</heading>Although there are significant variances such as a decrease of 17.5% in recruitment and training costs or 13.1% in credit card commissions, and an increase of 16.3% in sales and marketing expenses, it seems that the decrease in expenses compensates the increase, resulting in relatively balanced figures and percentages, with a rise in total costs, of £246, corresponding to 2.1%. <heading>3. Total Profit and Loss Analysis</heading><heading>3.1. Introduction</heading>According to Guilding (2002), the profit and loss statement has many advantages including, the adaptability to any business within the industry, the facility of comparing the different departments within the hotel, and their contribution to the overall financial performance of the organisation, all in one statement. According to Jagels and Coltman (2004), the P&L report permits consistency and regularity, enabling hotels to compare their performance and standards against general averages and data so as to facilitate decision making in order to improve performance. It also makes it possible for the hotel to compare its actual performance with the previous year, and therefore, analyse and identify changes, identifying areas needing an increase in management's attention and development (Burgess, 2001). <heading>3.1.2 Sales</heading>Understanding that the total P&L is an accumulative report of all other departments, it is clear that a rise in departmental sales will result in an overall increase in sales. This is what happened in The Bards Hall Hotel, with a total increase of £3,787, or 7.5%. <heading>3.1.3 Cost of Sales</heading>Equally cost of sales also increased, especially in the F&B department (14.2%) and resulted in a total increase of £755, or 13.3 %. It is important to analyse the variance percentage, because when regarding the individual percentages of cost of sales we note that the actual represents 11.8% of total sales, whilst budgeted costs correspond to 11.2%. These figures seem quite similar, and if neglected may have negative long-term results. Being variable costs, they are controllable and should be an area of focus for managers. <heading>3.1.4 Total Gross Profit</heading>The increase in total gross profit is a direct result of the changes in sales, and the increase of departmental gross profits. Although, costs also rose, it was not enough to cause negative consequences on the GP, resulting in an increase of £3,032 or 6.8%. <heading>3.1.5 Departmental Benefits</heading>There was a minor increase in payroll and benefits, which originated an extra £25 expense, and 0.2% of variance. <heading>3.1.6. Departmental Expenses</heading>There was also a small increase of 2.4% in departmental expenses (£121), which was not enough to cause damaging results. <heading>3.1.7 Departmental Profit</heading>The previous results of the departmental P&L reports resulted in an increase of 10.6% (£2,887) departmental profit. <heading>3.1.8 Administration Costs</heading>The slight increase in admin costs (£246), of 2.1% compared to budget does not appear to have great effect on the final performance. <heading>3.1.9 Gross Operating Profit</heading>All the slight increases in expenses, which were not enough to cause any disruption in overall performance and the more significant rise in departmental profits resulted in a total increase of 17%, or £2,641 in GOP. <heading>3.1.10 Fixed Costs</heading>Mainly because fixed costs are not influenced be degree of business (Burgess, 2001), there were no changes to be analysed in the fixed costs apart from an increase of £50 in interest on loan, which corresponds to a more significant 7.1% variance. There was a slight increase of 1.1. % of total fixed costs, possibly relative to the £50 increase of the interest of loan. <heading>3.1.11 Net Profit</heading>The total Profit and Loss report shows that there was a positive increase of 23.9% in net profit, which resulted from a general increase in sales (7.5%) and GOP (17.0%). It shows that a careful variable cost control can have high benefits on financial performance. As fixed costs alter mostly due to external factors, it is possible for the hotel to concentrate on its controllable costs, and increase its profit by increasing its sales, in comparison to costs, or boosting its revenue through cutting costs (Burgess, 2001). <heading>3.1.12 Total P&L Ratios</heading>The ratios in the total P&L show average figures per day, and these must be taken into account when calculating prices, or establishing strategies to cut costs. It is also important to state that average spends and figures per customer should also be analyse din this situation as they will complement the numbers presented and provide more precise decision-making. The net margin ratio shows the impact of payroll costs on total sales. Knowing that staff costs are relatively high, especially in the hospitality industry (Adams, 1997), it is crucial to keep track of this ratio, even more in this situation, where net margin represents 64.59%, having increased 1.11%. <heading>4. Balance Sheet</heading><heading>4.1 Introduction</heading>The Balance Sheet depicts the financial situation of a business at a particular point in time. It gives information on matters such as, the business's debts, it categorizes all the assets of the organization and shows the monetary margin with which the business can operate, in order to reduce its liabilities or develop itself (Jagels & Coltman, 2004). Ratios can be divided into turnover, liquidity, net worth-related to the business's capacity in responding to its continuing debts-and profitability ratios analysed in previously in the departmental analysis and will be used to explain balance sheet figures. <heading>4.2 Turnover Ratios</heading><heading>4.2.1 Food and Beverage Stock Turnover</heading>Food and Beverage stock turnover refers to the number of times stock is renewed during a certain time length (Burgess, 2001). It is normal for perishable products to have a high turnover and this means that ingredients are not kept for long before being used. The numbers for beverage turnover are normally lower as, they constitute non-perishable products and can hold for longer. In this case, the figures show that food stock is renewed 3.63 times, in a one-month period, whilst beverage stocks are turned over 0.6 times, within the same period. <heading>4.2.2 Stock Days</heading>Stock days relate to the number of days until the stock is used (Burgess, 2001). According to Adams (1997), it is best this figure is the lowest; however, in the case of food holding, both perishable and non-perishable should be considered. What this figure means is that the food stock is renewed every 8.28, an equivalent of 3.63 times in a month. The same happens to beverages where, it takes 50 days for the beverage to be used, corresponding to 0.60 time in a month. <heading>4.2.3 Fixed Asset Utilization Ratio</heading>The fixed asset utilization ratio assesses the amount of sales produced for every £1 of fixed assets owned (Kotas & Conlan, 1997). In this situation it is £0.51p and as there is only one fixed asset (although it's amount is very high), this amount might seem reasonable for the managers, however, the higher the value of the fixed assets, the more amount from sales should be given to the fixed assets. <heading>4.2.4 Net Asset Turnover </heading>The net asset turnover is also an asset utilization ratio, just as the above measures (Adams, 1997). It refers to how the business has been able to generate sales, and although it depends on various factors such as the type of business practised by the organization, in an overall point of view, the higher the ratio the better. In this case, and being a relatively small hotel with only 45 rooms with a large occupancy rate, the ratio seems rather positive and should either be maintained or increased; a rise in this ratio will happen almost automatically with a sales increase. <heading>4.2.5 Average Collection and Average Payment Period Ratios</heading>Although Kotas & Conlan (1997) consider the average collection period and the average payment period as measures and not ratios, they are still important factors which determine the time it takes for the hotel to collect its debts and how promptly it can pay. It will depend on the hotels overall financial condition as it takes, the hotel over a month (40 days), and over three months (112 days) to pay their debts. The terms and conditions agreed with the suppliers have a lot of influence in this situation as suppliers have different forms of doing business depending sometimes on their relationship with the actual hotel (i.e. if they buy large amounts, or if they have been working together for a long time). <heading>4.3 Liquidity Ratios</heading><heading>4.3.1 Current Ratio</heading>The current ratio is the capability of the hotel to cover its immediate debts (Jagels & Coltman, 2004) and, for hotels this may be 1.5 or sometimes less. What this figure means is that for every £1 of immediate debts, there is £5.98 of current assets, which is positive and should be investigated by managers to be sustained. <heading>4.3.2 Acid Test (Liquidity) Ratio</heading>According to (Jagels & Coltman, 2004), the acid test ratio represents how much liquid assets there are to cover £1 current liabilities. (Kotas & Conlan, 1997) state that it is not enough for a hotel to have a good current ratio, as this does not represent cash available for immediate operations. Both the acid test ratio and the current ratio show the capability of the hotel to meet its immediate financial debts (Jagels & Coltman, 2004). The minimum scale for this ratio is an equal value of both liquid assets and current liabilities. In this situation, for each £1 of current liabilities, the hotel has £5.83 of liquid resources, meaning that it posses a large amount of immediate cash to work with and possibly not so many current assets. <heading>4.4 Net Worth Ratios</heading>The last three ratios are net worth ratios corresponding to the relationship between all total tangible assets and liabilities (Jagels & Coltman, 2004). <heading>4.4.1 Debt to Equity</heading>The debt to equity is a capital gearing ratio (Adams, 1997) and can also be called total liabilities to total equity ratio (Jagels& Coltman, 2004) and involves the scope of monetary support granted by the shareholders and loan suppliers. Normally, when a business starts the loans seems to be higher than the shares, however, as the business gains dimension, this situation seems to invert. When observing the shares compared to the loans, although these (£120,000 of shares) are double the amount of loans (£60,000), meaning possibly that shareholders are investing money into the business, and the organization itself is quite established, it is still a rather high figure (50%) and should be either brought down or maintained. <heading>4.4.2 Total Assets to Total Liabilities</heading>The total assets to total liabilities ratio shows how much assets the hotel has for every £1 of liabilities. According to Jagels& Coltman (2004), the higher the ratio the better, as it will correspond to a safer margin. The problem emerges when the total assets become lower than total liabilities, as it will be very hard for the managers to covers all liabilities. The hotel, in this case, has nothing to worry about as for every £1 assets, it has £10.45 assets. <heading>4.4.3 Total Liabilities to Total Assets</heading>The total liabilities to total assets is the same as the previous one, however it is inversed, proposing that for every £1 of tangible assets, the hotel has to cover £0.10 liabilities, therefore, confirming a good financial position and representing no sort of threat to the development of business (Jagels & Coltman, 2004). <heading>5. Conclusion</heading>After analysing figures in the different statements, it is concluded that the Bards Hall Hotel general financial performance is positive; however, there is always room for improvement, and the remaining idea is that the hotel should work to keep control of its variable costs and improve sales, as these measure will contribute to a growth in profit (Burgess, 2001). The net worth ratios, also prove the positive performance of the measure and should be kept track of, as they guarantee economic stability (Jagels & Coltman, 2004).Other ratios such as average spend should also be continually monitored and if needed decreased, however, and as stated before, levels of quality should be assessed so they don't fall when cutting costs (Chin et al, 1995).
