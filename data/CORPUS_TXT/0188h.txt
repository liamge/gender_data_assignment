<heading>1. Isolation Method i</heading>For given reaction:  FORMULA  The rate law can be written in the following way:  FORMULA  Using the isolation method, and putting F in large excess we can assume [F] = constant. Thus meaning the rate of reaction will now have form:  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  A plot of time verses concentration of Br2, if linear, would mean that the order with respect to Br 2 is zeroth. From graph 1, we can see it is not zero, since it is a non-linear graph. By plotting ln([Br 2]o/[Br 2]) vs time, if the order with respect to Br 2 is first it will produce a linear graph, with gradient k'. Graph 2 shows the line is linear thus α = 1 and pseudo rate coefficient k' = 568.42 s -1 By recording values of k' and [F]o, it is possible to plot a graph of [F]o verses k'. If this graph is linear, then the order with respect to F is first, and also the gradient of the graph will give the rate constant k. Graph 3 shows a linear plot, thus the order with respect to F is first. The gradient of the graph is = 140.59, but the concentration is 10 -9 smaller, thus rate constant k = 1.4059 x 10 11 mol -1 dm 3 s -1. <list><heading>In summary:</heading>Order with respect to Br 2 = 1Order with respect to F = 1Overall order of reaction = 2Rate coefficient k = 1.4059 x 10 11 mol -1 dm 3 s -1</list><heading>2. Isolation method ii</heading>The oxidation of formaldehyde by chromic acid in perchloric acid has rate law:  FORMULA  If perchloric acid and formaldehyde are in total excess, the rate equation can be re-written as:  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  By plotting given values of [H 3O+] versus k', if the order of reaction with respect to H 3O+ is first would give a straight line. From graph 4, we can clearly see it is non-linear. Plotting [H 3O+]2 versus k' gives a straight line meaning α = 2. The gradient of this graph will also yield k[CH 3O]β. Given β=1, and the gradient = 2.7754 x 10-4 mol2 dm-6 s-1, and [CH 3O] = 0.035 mol dm-3. This means k = 7.9297 x 10-3 mol-2 dm6 s-1. <list><heading>Summary</heading>Order with respect to [H 3O+] = 2Order with respect to [CH 3O] = 1Order with respect to [CrO 4-] = 1Overall order of reaction = 4Rate coefficient k = 7.9297 x 10-3 mol -2 dm 6 s -1</list><heading>3. Arrhenius Equation</heading>For the decomposition of N205, the rate coefficient was measured at several temperatures. From this information the activation energy can be deduced.  FORMULA  Thus by taking natural logarithms of both sides we get:  FORMULA  thus by plotting ln k vs 1/T, we find the gradient is equal to -Ea/R. This can be seen in graph 4, where the gradient is -12395. We know that R = 8.314 J mol -1 K -1. Thus Ea = 103052.03 J mol -1 = 103.05 KJ mol -1.
