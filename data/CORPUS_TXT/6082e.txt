<heading>EXPERIMENT C - Thermal Properties C1 - Determination of the Thermal Conductivity of Glass (k)</heading><heading>Objectives</heading>To determine the thermal conductivity of glass using the method involving glass tubing. <heading>Introduction</heading>Thermal conductivity of a material, hence glass, is the rate of heat transfer through 1m2 cross sectional area, when a temperature difference of 1K is maintained over a distance of 1m. In simpler terms it is the measure of the ability of a material to conduct heat. (unit: Js -1m -1 oC -1 or W -1m -1 oC -1) <heading>Results</heading><table/>Calculations (see p.6 - 8) <heading>Discussion</heading>Water of higher temperatures (from Table 1, a range from 33.0 to 90.0  oC) collected in the beaker is likely to evaporate slightly in transfer before weighing, plus there is a short walking distance between the water collection point and the weighing - electronic scale. This can be minimised by keeping the same walking pace of the same person from collection to weighing; the same accurate electronic scale is used throughout the practical. For improvement, ideally is to have the scale placed beneath the beaker while water emerging, thus will be able to record the immediate water mass with minimum loss through evaporation. It is also possible to note the continuous increasing water mass, which surely gives a better idea of the relationship between the three different flow rates at three different temperatures. Beakers used may not be completely dry. It is preferred to use a different dry beaker provided for each water collection. Same person of the group carried out the same part of experiment e.g. weighing, in order to maintain consistency. T 1 (14 oC) is well monitored and kept constant throughout. However, a digital thermometer can be used for more accurate temperature readings, thus human errors could be reduced. Due to the time limitation, only three flow rates and a repeat of each could be obtained. More repeats should be done if more time allowed as repeats increase the reliability of a practical. However, from k values (thermal conductivity of glass) calculated and comparing to the literature value, this suggests that a set of reliable results produced. <heading>Conclusion</heading>From Table 1, the flow rate (M) increases with a lower temperature. Thermal conductivity changes with temperature. From k 1 and k 3 (p.8 - Table 4), it has decreased slightly as the temperature increases. It is consistent that the k values obtained from Equation 3 are all 0.002 less than k values from Equation 2. This shows the slight variation of calculations using different standard equations based on the same results. (p.8 - Table 4) Since the two sets of glass thermal conductivity values (k), which vary from 0.319 to 0.413 W -1 m -1 oC -1, match with the literature value of 0.1 to 1.0 W -1 m -1 K -1, I can conclude that this practical was carried out reasonably accurately that to overcome the limitations would have been accounted. <heading>Reference</heading>"conductivity" A Dictionary of Physics.

Also the specific heat of water and paraffin oil by cooling. Specific heat capacity is the amount of energy required to raise a unit (1kg) mass of material through unit temperature rise (1K). Unit: J kg -1 K -1 <heading>Results</heading><table/><table/><table/><heading>Calculations</heading>From Newton's Law of Cooling:  FORMULA  N.B. specific heat capacity of water = 4.18 x 10 3 J kg -1 ˚C -1 At 67.0 °C  FORMULA  At 62.3 °C  FORMULA  <heading>Conclusion</heading>From Fig. 1, the greater gradient of paraffin cooling line than water, and the more rapid decrease of temperature in the calorimeter suggest the paraffin oil cools faster than water. The literature value for heat capacity of oil is ~ 2.00 x 10 3 J kg -1 ˚C -1. The average value obtained from our practical is 1.17 x 10 3 J kg -1 ˚C -1, which shows a considerable difference. The reasons are like to be significant sources of errors within the practical. Nevertheless, two reasonable specific heat values have been produced by following strictly the Newtons Law of Cooling.
