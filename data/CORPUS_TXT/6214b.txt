<abstract><heading>Abstract</heading>Aquaponics, the integration of aquaculture and hydroponic crop production represents a more environmentally benign and energy efficient method of production than each method practiced in isolation. This study sought to ascertain the viability of aquaponics as an alternative to conventional hydroponics when producing lettuce (Lactuca sativa) cv. 'Trinity'. Three treatments produced lettuce in recirculating systems in four trials between August and December 2006. Control treatments supplied the plants with a full spectrum of nutrients, whilst two aquaponic treatments supplied the plants with water from cold-water aquariums containing either solely goldfish (Carassius auratus), or from identical goldfish aquariums with additional iron (FeEDTA) at two parts per million. The final trial examined the effects of fish stocking density. Growth rate and leaf chlorophyll content were measured to examine the effects of each treatment. Tissue analysis of dried leaf tissue from the second and fourth trials ascertained mean N, P and K concentrations in leaf tissue for each treatment. Statistical analysis showed significantly lower growth rates in both aquaponic treatments compared with the control in the initial three trials. In trial 4, no significant differences were observed in growth rates. Leaf chlorophyll concentration was significantly different to across treatments in one trial and leaf tissue analysis showed some differences in N, P and K concentrations across the three treatments in one trial. The study ascertained that lettuce variety 'Trinity' may grow in an aquaponic system at rates comparable to conventional hydroponics, as long as fish stocking densities are high enough. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>This trial was designed to compare growth rates and tissue composition of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) grown using a commercial mix hydroponic nutrient solution with lettuce grown in water taken from a cold-water aquarium. Hydroponic crops obtain their total nutrient requirement from soluble inorganic salts whilst aquaculture generally discharges nutrient-rich wastewater to maintain fish health (Lucas & Southgate, 2002). Aquaponics is the integration of recirculating aquaculture and hydroponic crop production (Rackocy, 2004) and mirrors the natural process of nitrogen uptake that would occur in an aquatic ecosystem; the fish waste acting as a nutrient-source for the plants, which, in turn remove unwanted products from the aquaculture system (fig. 1.1). <heading>Principles of an aquaponic system</heading>Fish health is maintained through phytoremediation of tank water Plant growth is maintained through fish-derived nutrients. The amount of nitrogenous waste produced dependent upon protein content of feed (Lennard, 2004) Hydroponic substrate and plant roots can provide habitat for nitrifying bacteria (ibid) The design of this trial was developed from literature available on the Aquaponics.com webpage "Building a mini-aquaponic system" (Nelson, 2004). <figure/><heading>Literature review</heading>Food production has recently come under scrutiny from the environmental lobby and the media, whilst the depletion of sea fish stocks through over fishing means that on-shore fish farms may become more prevalent in coming years (Purvis, 2003). Warm water species such as Tilapia and Barramundi are already beginning to be farmed in intensive, indoor fish farms in the UK (New Forest Barramundi, 2006, Times Online, 2005). An increase in the number of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones in the last ten years (DEFRA 2005; Appendix 1) and concerns regarding the amount of nitrogenous waste entering the environment (Hooper, 2006) means these businesses may find it increasingly difficult to dispose of their waste products. In addition, industries such as horticulture and agriculture are also being made aware of the need to use non-renewable energy sources and water more wisely. Aquaponics goes some way to reducing the environmental impact of food production in the following ways: <list>Increased efficiency in waste management and water conservation (Wilson, 2006)Reduced energy use per unit of produceCompatibility with urban situation can reduce the 'carbon footprint' by cutting down on pollution caused by transportation ("food miles") (ibid) Increased crop yields compared with soil-based systems as well as conventional hydroponic systems (Savidov, 2006)</list>The above factors also go some way to increasing the profitability of both the aquaculture and horticultural produce. Disadvantages in aquaponic production systems include high start-up costs and reliance upon skilled staff to create and maintain a nutrient-balanced system. Knowledge of both crop production and fish rearing is required, and thus most current systems are personal hobbies, small, family-run businesses, or academic demonstrations of the technique. The time required before the grower sees the benefits of an aquaponic system must also be seen as a drawback. It is currently estimated that growth in aquaponic systems will not reach its full potential until at least six, and ideally twelve months of operation (Savidov 2006). The intensive nature of large-scale food production in the UK probably limits potential for diversification into aquaponics to smaller growers. One possibility, is for aquaponics to be used to produce organic fish and organic hydroponic fruits/vegetables under glass. However, current rulings, in the UK at least, by regulatory bodies such as The Soil Association stipulate that produce must be grown in soil to be certified organic. The need to work in harmony with soil flora and fauna means that even organically-derived nutrient solutions are not acceptable. It could be argued however that soilless growing preserves the soil-borne organisms as the soil is left completely undisturbed. Furthermore, recent work at the Crops Research Centre in Alberta, Canada suggests that the micro-organisms may be key to the success of an aquaponic system, Savidov (2006) noting that the 200% increase in Genovese basil yield over four years was likely due to bio-stimulants released by populations of benthic organisms. Atkin and Nichols (2004), using manure-derived nutrient solutions in conventional hydroponics, researched the possibility of organic hydroponics in New Zealand but the results were disappointing. The major wastes from aquaculture and the major fertilisers for crop production are ammonia in its ionic form, ammonium (NH 4+) and nitrate (NO 3-), as well as phosphates (PO 43-). Other chemical by-products of fish production may also serve as plant micronutrients. This has meant a wide range of crops, including cucumbers (Cucumis sativus), beans (Vicia faba) (McMurty, 1986), strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa) (Takeda et al, 1997), tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) and melons (Cucumis spp.) (UVI, 2001) have been successfully grown using aquaponics in previous experiments. A large proportion successful research, however has used lettuce and leafy herbs in the hydroponic component of the system, possibly because of its lower demand for potassium (K) (Resh, 1995), a nutrient not generally found in high concentrations in fish-culture water. Furthermore, with only one growth stage (as a commercial crop) lettuce does not generally require the change in nutrient formula of a fruiting crop such as tomatoes, as it begins to produce flowers and fruit (ibid). Lettuce is a widely grown crop in the UK and can be produced under glass all year-round. It is feasible that growers could consider using an aquaponic system to create a second income stream from fish farming alongside lettuce production, simultaneously reducing their fertiliser budget. It is possible to supplement the aquaculture water with plant nutrients harmless to fish (Rakocy et al, 2004, Chaves et al, 2000) or even grow fish in complete hydroponic nutrient solution (Seawright et al, 1998). Previous studies in aquaponics have often been carried out as aquaculture-based research projects, the hydroponic crop being seen as a by-product of the low-tech biological filtration. The majority of these systems have farmed warm water Tilapia (Oreochromis spp. ) in the aquaculture portion of the system, as these fish reach saleable size quickly and tolerate high nitrate loading in their grow-out tanks (Dontje et al, 1999). Successful trials have been carried out using cold water species such as trout (McMurty, 1986), but owing to the lower stocking densities tolerated by cold water species (due to relatively high oxygen demand), research has tended to favour warm water species. Most studies have included edible fish; however, a proposed project to take place in the Netherlands will use ornamental fish (Aquaponics Journal, 2006). <picture/>The hydroponic production method has varied in previous trials. Where Nutrient film Technique (NFT) has been twinned with fish production systems with dedicated solids removal, aeration and biological filtering, floating polystyrene rafts have been used in gullies of aquaculture effluent (Fig. 1.2) (UVI, 2001, Rakocy, 2004). In substrate-based systems, the movement of the water through the medium provides aeration and can be used to provide mechanical solids filtering as well as providing the necessary surface to be colonised by nitrifying bacteria (Lennard & Leonard, 2004, McMurty, 1986). Indeed the necessity of removing solid waste from aquaponic systems is a current cause of disagreement amongst hobbyists and researchers such as Rackocy, Lennard and Savidov. Anecdotal evidence from Rakocy at The University of the Virgin Islands also suggests that the balance of macro and micronutrients can be controlled by altering the amount of solid waste removed from the fish production element, although no work has been published in support of this theory. Jones (1997) also notes that non-ionic soil-borne substances such as amino acids, simple proteins, carbohydrates and urea can be assimilated in conventional soil-based cultivation by mass flow and contribute to plant growth. Substrate-filled grow beds may also have practical advantages such as temperature regulation and water-holding capacity if pumps fail. Flood-and-drain and continuous flow irrigation have been trialled, with initial work suggesting that reciprocating flow (flood and drain) provided greater aeration and more even nutrient distribution through the substrate (McMurty, 1997 cited in Lennard & Leonard, 2004). Lennard and Leonard (2004) however disproved this theory, attaining higher yield [lettuce], higher dissolved oxygen concentrations and smaller water losses from a continuous-flow irrigation system. <heading>Hydroponic lettuce production</heading>As Jones (1997) comments, although there Have been many published formulas for the preparation of hydroponic nutrient solutions from as long ago as the late 19 th Century, the appropriate tailoring of the concentration of each constituent to the crop and production method is still largely down to the personal preference of the grower. Madestein UK Ltd, a well established produced of lettuce plants, supplied the formulation used for the control treatment in this trial. The effects of nutrient deficiency on the appearance and growth of plants is well documented and hydroponic nutrient solutions need to provide a complete spectrum of essential nutrients for crop growth and often supply these elements in excess to ensure maximum crop growth. Whilst many of these elements can have a deleterious effect on growth at high concentrations, supplying nutrients at supra-optimal levels ensures that assimilates are not used to produce excess root as the plant is forced to 'forage' for nutrition. Authors such as Resh (1995 and 2006) and Jones (1993) suggest the following approximate concentrations for lettuce production: <table/><heading>Nutrient content of aquaculture waste</heading>Waste products from aquaculture are either solid, organic matter, or aqueous, inorganic compounds, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus based. Whilst the majority of these compounds are not lethal to fish, it is beneficial to keep levels low as the effects on human health of eating fish grown in nutrient laden water are not entirely understood (Lucas and Southgate 2003). Methaemoglobinemia, or 'blue baby syndrome' due to high levels if nitrate in drinking water, however is well documented (Hooper 2006). Failure to remediate the water used in a recirculating fish production system may lead to a reduction of efficiency of fish production (Stickney 2005). High levels of nitrate and phosphate in such systems left unchecked lead to the build up of algae, which must be removed, adding to the operating costs. Intensive aquaculture systems, even those that recirculate water from the growth tanks, produce a high density of waste products, and must either remove a portion of the water (usually on a daily basis (New Forest Barramundi 2006)) to maintain acceptable levels of aqueous waste or remove unwanted compounds on site. This may be followed by water re-use or by discharging the cleaner effluent into watercourses or sewage. Effluent treatment may consist of removal of inorganic nutrients through sewage treatment e.g. constructed wetlands, or expensive denitrification steps in recirculating systems. Secondary and tertiary water treatments before disposal may significantly reduce aquaculture profits and may mean large outlay for no return. Whilst a retrofitted hydroponics setup is costly, this outlay can be recouped from the sale of crops unlike the capital invested in reed bed treatment for example (Lucas & Southgate 2003). Solids removal is another costly but necessary process in recirculating fish farms. The break-down of faecal matter in the growth tanks uses oxygen as well as obstructing water flow. Most systems for solids removal rely upon belt removal or vortex generators that allow solids to collect at the bottom of a conical tank enabling minimal water loss in their removal (New Forest Barramundi 2006). Fish farms in Israel, where environmental conditions and scarcity of water may be limiting factors, have incorporated greenhouse technology into aquaculture to control humidity, light and temperature (Kolkovski et al. 2003). This, as in controlled environment horticulture, gives producers greater control over the growth rate and quality of their product. In order to maximise available water, producers use super intensive recirculating systems, with up to 100kg of fish per cubic metre of water, meaning 10% of the water volume is fish biomass. Incorporating hydroponics into such systems have successfully produced crop yields twice that of conventional agriculture in the same region (ibid). Savidov (2006) has also researched the potential for aquaponics in a cool-climate, protected cropping scenario. This work has trialled many crops, both edible and ornamental since 2002 using a system based around that at the University of the Virgin Islands (ibid). <heading>Aquaponics - a more holistic approach </heading>Aquaponics does not merely combine the technology of aquaculture and hydroponics. Recent theories by aquaponics researchers on the importance of a well established microbial population on plant growth e.g. those of Savidov (2006) are echoed in the work of hydroponics researchers such as Vernieri et al (2006). These works reinforce the ideas of aquaponics proponents who believe the method to represent a more holistic approach to crop production by harnessing natural plant, animal and microbial interaction in order to reduce external inputs. The horticultural focus of this study made goldfish (Carassius auratus) a sensible choice for the fish component of the system as they are hardier, and thus require less specialist care, than tropical or commercial food species. Cold water aquaria present less of a problem when attempting to maintain levels of dissolved oxygen as lower temperatures allow for higher amounts of the gas to be dissolved. As the tank water would be flowing past respiring plant roots and there would potentially be a large amount of decomposing fish waste in the grow beds, both of which consume oxygen, a cold water set-up was considered more appropriate. With no need to heat the aquaria water, there was also reduced risk of equipment failure. Furthermore, as goldfish flake food is approximately 40% protein, which is, in turn 16% nitrogen (Wurts 2006) this species would excrete more nitrogen-rich waste. Most literature aimed at hobby-aquarists stress the need to feed goldfish only moderately as they will consume much more food than they require, leading to a rapid deterioration of water quality (O'Neill 2004). Although this poses a problem in domestic fish tanks, this trait was seen as advantageous in the aquaponic systems to be trialled at . <heading>Objectives</heading>This study was designed to compare the growth rate, chlorophyll content, and leaf tissue N, P and K content of lettuce in two aquaponic treatments (one with and one without supplementary iron) and a nutritionally complete hydroponic control treatment. This comparison was achieved by comparing various growth parameters before and at harvest along with tissue analysis post-harvest. Other data were recorded (nitrate content, pH and electro-conductivity of the nutrient solutions, and root production by the plants) in order to explain any differences in growth rates. The following hypotheses were tested: There is no significant difference in growth rates of lettuce grown in aquarium effluent and lettuce grown in a commercial strength hydroponic nutrient solution. Leaf chlorophyll content of lettuce grown in aquarium effluent with added FeEDTA chelate is significantly greater than that of lettuce grown in aquarium effluent alone. There is no significant difference in leaf tissue N, P and K levels between lettuce grown in aquarium effluent and lettuce grown in a commercial strength hydroponic nutrient solution. <heading>Materials and Method</heading>The design of the systems used in this project is loosely based around the work published in 2004 by Lennard and Leonard: a continuous-flow lettuce production system. These systems will however also draw from the work of Malcolm (Backyard Aquaponics 2006), whose grow beds contain expanded clay aggregate. <heading>Expanded clay aggregate</heading>Expanded clay aggregate gives fast drainage, allowing for high flow rates. The size of the substrate particles and porous nature of the material may also give the water a relatively high oxygen content, advantageous for both fish and lettuce growth (Goto et al 1996; UVI 2001). Smith (1996) also suggested this substrate had the advantage of maintaining a dry surface due to less capillarity, again because of particle size, that results in reduced algae formation. It was anticipated that the clay would also give both pH buffering and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) benefits (ibid). The honeycomb structure of the material also gave a large surface area to be colonised by nitrifying bacteria. <heading>Experimental design</heading>It was initially planned to randomise the treatments through the glasshouse in order to reduce the effects of environmental differences within. However, due to the heavy reliance on glasshouse staff for feeding, the replicates of the treatments were arranged so that all tanks containing fish were grouped together. Three different treatments, each with two replicates, were used to produce lettuce plants hydroponically. Six plastic tanks contained the following: <heading>Tanks 1 and 2 </heading><list>Approx. 70 litres water from mains supply.

(concentration taken from Resh 1995; Demeyer et al 2001; UVI 2001). </list>FeEDTA is intended for use in hydroponic systems when the pH of the nutrient solution is around 6.5 - 7.0. However, even at a pH of around 8.0, limited iron is still accessible (Figure 2.1), and since neither the control treatment nor the Aquaponic + Fe treatment was pH-altered, the iron availability was considered constant across these two treatments. The preferable pH range in aquaria to ensure goldfish health and maintain a efficient action of nitrifying bacteria is around 7.5 - 7.8 (Bio-Con Labs inc. no date; O'Neill 2004). The decision was therefore made not to alter the pH of the water in any tanks; however, if iron deficiency symptoms, namely chlorosis of younger leaf tissue (Jones 1997), was observed in either of the two treatments containing iron, this would be reviewed. <figure/><heading>Nutrient Supply</heading>The water from each tank was pumped into to a 1.5m length of rain gutter filled with expanded clay aggregate. The gutters were inclined at the end furthest from the tanks so that water returned to the tank (Figure 2.2). The pumps in each tank continuously recirculated the water. Each tank was covered in plastic sheeting. This was black on the inside to prevent algal growth on the tank walls and white on the outer side to reflect sunlight and prevent the water becoming too warm. Initial construction took place on 6th July 2006. <figure/>Water was supplied from each tank using a Blagdon MiniPond 700 pump to the substrate-filled gutters via standard 13mm irrigation tubing. The piping was attached along one interior side of the guttering using zip-ties threaded through holes drilled in the gutter. Eight holes approximately 3mm in diameter were punched at regular intervals of around 150-200mm along the section of pipe that ran inside the gutter. The water flow was adjusted using the pumps' control valves to ensure minimum water was lost through splashing whilst still maintaining a rapid flow rate to ensure maximum aeration of the water. During a run-in period, when no fish or plants were present, significant water loss had been observed due to evaporation from the surface of the tanks and from splashing as the water returned to the tanks. In order to minimise these problems, black horticultural shade cloth was used to cover the tanks in an attempt to reduce evaporation. The same material was also attached to the lower end of the gutters so the returning water ran down the cloth and into the tanks with minimal splashing (Figure 2.3). This also had the secondary effect of increasing the surface area available to be colonised by nitrifying bacteria. <picture/><heading> Action of nitrifying bacteria and tank 'cycling'</heading>In order to efficiently convert harmful ammonia and nitrite into less toxic nitrate all aquaria rely on biological filtration. Ammonia (NH 3) is excreted directly from the gills of fish as protein is metabolized (below), as well as being produced by the bacterial breakdown of solid wastes and excess food (Bio-Con Labs 2007)  FORMULA  (where R = organic nitrogen radical) The two most important genera of nitrifying bacteria, which facilitate the conversion of NH 3 and the less toxic ionic form ammonium (NH 4+) to nitrite (NO 2-) and then nitrate (NO 3-) are Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter respectively (University of Minnesota 2006). These bacteria are obligate chemolithotrophs, deriving their energy from the oxidation of inorganic salts and fulfilling their carbon requirements from carbon dioxide (CO 2) (Bio-Con Labs 2007). They are also obligate aerobes as the following equations demonstrate:  FORMULA  This occurs in alkaline conditions, where the ammonia does not hydrolyze into its ionic form so readily. Then the nitrite is oxidised to nitrate:  FORMULA  (University of Minnesota 2006; Randall No date) These bacteria need time and a source of ammonia to reach a useful population size. Their reproduction rates are around sixty times slower than heterotrophic bacteria, taking around 15-20 hours to divide due to the low energy derived from the oxidation reactions (Bio-Con Labs 2006). After initial construction, the four tanks that were to contain fish were 'cycled' using a bacterial starter colony solution and small amounts of fish food as a source of ammonia. This process coated the growing medium with enough bacteria prior to the addition of the fish to minimise toxic build-up of ammonia when the fish were introduced. The bacteria are non-motile and colonies attach to all submerged surfaces in the tank and continuously wetted substrate with a secreted slime matrix (ibid). The fish were added to tanks 3-6 after two weeks of cycling. <heading>Addition of fish and nutrient build-up</heading>Eight goldfish were added to tanks 3 - 6 on 27th July and ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and hardness levels in the four fish tanks were monitored by dipping Esha Aquatest 5-in-1 test strips into the fish tank water during the following week. Six days after adding the fish, test-strips indicated approximately 50-100 ppm NO 3-, which was deemed adequate to support lettuce growth. <heading>Selection and addition of lettuce plants</heading>Prior to their addition to the systems, the lettuce plants were grown from seed in rockwool propagating blocks and irrigated with water. The variety of lettuce used in this trial was 'Trinity' grown from seed supplied by S&G Seeds. Fifty-six seedlings in rockwool propagating cubes were selected. These were arranged in a tray in a grid with seven columns and eight rows. The seven plants for each treatment were selected by taking one from each column but from a random row number. The following data for each of the remaining 14 plants was recorded: <list>Diameter (mean of two measurements taken at right angles through centre of plant) - measured to the nearest 0.5cm using a standard 30cm ruleHeight - measured to the nearest 0.5cm using a standard 30cm rule Number of leavesTotal leaf area (cm 2) - measured using a Delta-T leaf area meterLeaf fresh weight (g) - all non-senescent leaves removed level with top of rockwool blockRoot fresh weight (g) - roots protruding from the propagating block were removed and weighedLeaf dry weight (g) - fresh leaf material dried at 70˚C for approximately two weeksRoot dry weight (g) - fresh root material dried at 70 ˚C for approximately two weeks.</list>All weights were recorded using a Sartorius 1212 MP balance. Root fresh and dry weights were taken throughout the project as the weight of those roots that protruded from the rock wool propagating block (Figure 3.4). <picture/>This process was replicated prior to each growth trial, each set of mean measurements from these plants serving as a base line when comparing the effects of each treatment at the end of the trial. <heading>Trials 1, 2 and 3</heading>The 42 lettuces to be grown on, in their rock wool propagation cubes, were pushed into the clay substrate at approximately 20cm intervals, allowing direct irrigation from each of the holes punched in the irrigation pipe. Nutrient solution was added to tanks 1 and 2 until an EC value of 1.5 mS was reached (175ml from both tank A and B). This represents a widely used concentration for most hydroponic crops. The first batch of lettuces was harvested after 21 days (23 rd August). At this time a second batch of pre-grown transplants were introduced. Tanks 1 and 2 were replenished with fresh water and nutrient solution to bring the EC back to 1.5 mS and the plants were then grown on for 21 days. A third trial was conducted using the same procedure from 2nd to 23rd October. Prior to the third trial, the entire nutrient solution in tanks 1 & 2 was again discarded and replaced with fresh water and nutrient solution. This procedure was also carried out prior to trial 4. <heading>Trial 4</heading>In order to assess the effects of fish stocking densities, a fourth trial was conducted along similar lines as the previous three, only with 16 fish in each of the aquaponic systems, double the number used in the first three trials. In order to facilitate this without purchasing further fish, the aquaponic + Fe treatment was omitted. This trial ran from 27th November to 18th December with the addition of glasshouse heating and supplementary overhead lighting. <heading>Data Recording</heading><heading>Daily</heading>Maximum and minimum air temperature (from glasshouse max/min thermometer). <heading>Weekly </heading><list>Height and diameter of each plant .EC of the nutrient solutions (using a Hanna instruments HI 933000 EC meter) .Water parameters of each tank using, measuring:pH of the irrigation water (using a Hanna Instruments HI 8014 pH meter)Nitrate content of irrigation water (ppm NO 3--N) using Aquarium Pharmaceuticals Inc. nitrate test kit.

The nitrate content of aquarium water is simple to measure using either reactive pads on paper strips (which proved inaccurate) or a standard reagent test kit, commonly used for domestic aquariums (this test was used for the majority of the project). When using the reagent method, two reagents must be added to the water under test and then the sample must be set aside for five minutes whilst a colour change takes place. On comparison with a colour chart, he intensity of the colour indicates the level of nitrate in parts per million (ppm) (figure 2.4). <picture/>Where the colour intensity appeared to fall between two concentrations on the colour card, an estimate was made; e.g. at the beginning of the each trial, the control solutions gave readings that were definitely darker than the 80 ppm reading on the card but not as dark as the next 160 ppm gradation. In this instance, the readings were recorded as 100 ppm. <heading>Leaf tissue analysis</heading>Dry leaf tissue from trials 2 and 4 was crushed and sent to NRM laboratories for N, P and K analysis. Leaves from all plants in each system were amalgamated to give two samples for each treatment in each trial. This resulted in six sets of data for trial 2 and four sets of data for trial 4. <heading>Data Analysis</heading>All data were collated using Microsoft Excel. All significance testing was carried out using the ANOVA function in Genstat version 9.0. <heading>Results</heading><heading>Nitrate Levels</heading><figure/>The plants were added to the substrate as soon as nitrate levels had reached levels acceptable for plant growth. Test strips indicated NO 3- levels of 50-100ppm on 1st August and the plants were added the following day. Later in the first growth period, comparisons of nitrate levels using these strips alongside another type of test using liquid reagents showed the strips to indicate much higher levels of nitrate than the reagent test. The limited growth shown in the aquaponic systems during this period appeared to reinforce the inaccuracy of the strips and they were no longer used. During the first trial, nitrate levels in the aquaponic systems had fallen to 10-20 ppm after seven days of lettuce growth (Figure 3.1). Towards the end of the first trial, the amount of food applied to tanks 3 - 6 was greatly increased. Glasshouse staff were instructed to feed two 'large pinches' to the fish daily. This equated to approximately 8g per day and as a result, nitrate levels of 40 ppm were recorded on 31 st August. Considerable water loss was noted in systems 3 and 5 during the first week of trial 1 as irrigation jets became blocked and water was forced over the side of the gutters. The blockages resulted from particles of algae becoming trapped in the irrigation holes. This algal 'bloom' is a well-documented phenomenon in new aquaria (O'Neill 2004). The lost water in these tanks was replaced with water drawn from the mains, thus diluting any nutrients that had accumulated in solution. During second trial, increased feeding rates helped nitrate concentrations climb to 40 ppm in systems 3, 4 and 6 by the end of the trial. The concentration in system 5 remained 10-20 ppm lower than the other aquaponic systems during this time, following water loss and the death of one goldfish. At the beginning of the third trial, nitrate levels in the four aquaponic systems had reached 40 ppm. During the 21-day growth period, this concentration remained constant. Increasing the stocking density of goldfish in the two aquaponic systems caused nitrate levels to reach approximately 80 ppm in the period between the end of trial 3 and the commencement of trial 4. This concentration was closer to that found in the control systems than at the start of any of the previous trials. <heading>pH</heading><figure/>All treatments began with pH readings of 8.4, that of the mains water supply. The pH of the aquaponic systems showed a downward trend throughout the project. This was expected as a result of the action of nitrifying bacteria and fish respiration, however the fall in these tanks was not sufficient in relation to the control treatment to make any elements significantly more or less available (Figure 3.2). By the end of the trial, and after an unexplained fall in pH in all systems at the start of the final trial, the water of the two remaining aquaponic systems had a pH of 7.1. <heading>Electro-Conductivity</heading><figure/>At the beginning of the study, electro-conductivity (EC) readings between 0.55 and 0.58 mS were recorded across the aquaponic systems. In comparison, stock nutrient solution was added to the control systems to obtain EC values of 1.44 and 1.49 mS. The EC of the aquaria water showed a general upward trend over the entire project, however when significant water-loss necessitated the addition of mains water, the EC of these fell, most notably in tanks 4 and 5 during the first and second trials (Figure 3.3). One fish mortality occurred during the first trial, in tank 5, on 22nd August. This was replaced during the first week of the second trial, and this tank showed lower EC levels (Figure 3.3) as well as lower nitrate concentrations (Figure 3.1) than the other aquaponic tanks throughout the second trial. One further fish was found dead during the second trial on 12 th September in tank 4. This fish was replaced in the second week of trial 3. <heading>Growth Rates</heading><heading>Plant size</heading>The diameter and height of each plant was measured weekly during each trial. These measurements enabled the calculation of a 'volume' measurement for each lettuce and allowed a non-destructive comparison of growth rates between planting and harvest. The decision was made to consider both height and diameter as some plants tended towards a narrower but taller morphology, and some towards a flatter, wider morphology. Measuring the plants in this way does, however mean that differences in canopy density may lead to inaccuracies when making a direct comparison. <figure/>Figure 3.4 shows the slow increase in plant size in both aquaponic treatments compared to the control treatment during the first growth trial. The mean volume of the control plants at the end of this trial was over 3000cm 3 compared to 210.95 and 235.21cm 3 in the aquaponic and aquaponic + Fe treatments respectively After seven days of growth in the second trial, the mean volume of plants in the aquaponic treatment supplemented with FeEDTA was marginally higher than the control (Figure 3.5) and the un-supplemented aquaponic treatment (878.38 cm 3, compared to 846.59 cm 3 and 742.06 cm 3 respectively). After 14 days, the mean volume of plants in the control treatment was the greatest (3142.26cm 3). By this time, the nitrate concentration in the aquaponic systems 3, 4 and 6 had fallen to 20 ppm, whilst that in system 5 had fallen to 10 ppm (Figure 3.1). <figure/><figure/>Volume measurements recorded after seven days' growth in the third trial were comparable across all three treatments, although the control plants were marginally larger. Fourteen days into the trial, however, there was a marked difference in plant size between the control treatment and the two aquaponic treatments (Figure 3.6). By the end of the grow-out period, the control plants' mean volume was significantly greater than both of the aquaponic treatments' plants. As in the two previous trials, there was no significant difference in mean plant volume between the two aquaponic treatments (lsd = 258.7 at P=0.05) <figure/>Throughout the final growth trial, the mean volume of plants in the aquaponic treatment was greater than that of the control treatment. After the 21-day grow-out period, the mean volume of plants in the aquaponic treatment was 1520.8 cm 3 compared to 843.4 cm 3 in the control treatment (Figure 3.7). It was noted though, that the plants grown in the aquaponic treatment displayed a much more open head structure than the control plants, which accounted for the marked difference in mean plant volume. <heading>Leaf area and number increase</heading>To compare the size of plants in each treatment more accurately, the number of new leaves and the total leaf area increase was utilised (Tables 3.1 and 3.2). The destructive nature of this comparison however meant it could only be carried out after harvest. In the first trial, the control treatment produced plants with a significantly greater mean leaf area increase and a significantly greater number of leaves than the two aquaponic treatments. Plants from the aquaponic + Fe treatment showed a leaf area increase between 10% and 20% greater than the un-supplemented aquaponic treatment in trials 1-3, although this was not significant at the P=0.05 level. <table/>After the fourth trial the mean leaf area increase of plants from the aquaponic treatment was significantly higher than that of plants from the control at the P=0.05 level. Analysis of the number of new leaves produced during the first three trials showed significant differences between the control and each of the aquaponic treatments but not between the aquaponic treatments themselves at the P=0.05 level (Table 3.2). After the fourth trial, however, there was no significant difference in leaf number increase between the control and the aquaponic treatment. <table/><heading>Leaf fresh and dry weight increase</heading>The growth rate was calculated for each plant using both fresh and dry weights by subtracting the final weight from the mean starting weight, which had been calculated from the 14 reference plants. The resulting gain was then divided by 21 days to give a simple growth rate in g d -1. In the first trial, plants from the hydroponic control treatment showed a mean leaf fresh weight increase of 2.96g d -1 over the three weeks (Figure 3.8). At over ten times the fresh weight increase per day, shown in either the aquaponic or aquaponic + Fe treatments, the difference was highly significant. <figure/>There were significant differences in leaf dry weights across the three treatments. The mean leaf dry weight increase in the control treatment (0.12g d -1) was significantly higher than that in the aquaponic treatment and the aquaponic + Fe treatment, whose mean leaf dry weight increase per day values were identical at 0.06g d -1 (lsd = 0.016 at P=0.05). In the second trial, the control treatment continued to outperform the two aquaponic treatments in terms of fresh weight gain per day with a growth rate close to that observed in trial 1 (Figure 3.9). There were significant differences between the control treatment (2.88g d -1) and both the aquaponic treatment (1.07g d -1) and the Fe-supplemented aquaponic treatment (1.22g d -1) at harvest, but not between the two aquaponic treatments (lsd= 0.374 at P=0.05). <figure/>After drying, significant differences were again seen across the three treatments. The mean leaf dry weight increase in the control treatment (0.11g d -1) was significantly higher than that in the aquaponic treatment and the aquaponic + Fe treatment (lsd = 0.016 at P=0.05). The mean leaf dry weight increase per day was identical for the aquaponic treatments (0.06g d -1). Trial 3 showed much the same pattern in growth rates, with the control plants showing a mean fresh weight increase per day over four times higher than each of the aquaponic treatments (Figure 3.10). The P=0.05 lsd of 0.879 indicated no significant difference in growth rate between the two aquaponic treatments. <figure/>Mean leaf dry weight increases in trial 3 were 0.012 g d -1, 0.003 g d -1 and 0.004g d -1 for plants from the control, aquaponic and aquaponic + Fe treatments respectively. Statistical analysis again revealed significant differences between the control and both aquaponic treatments, but not between the aquaponic treatments, at the P=0.05 level (lsd = 0.0024). In the final trial, when fish stocking density was doubled in the aquaponic treatment, no significant differences were observed in fresh weight increase per day (Figure 3.11, P=0.05 lsd = 0.113). After drying, the mean leaf fresh weight increase per day for both treatments was identical (0.0063 g d -1). <figure/><picture/><heading>Root dry weight</heading>The level of root production was measured and analysed across treatments in all four trials. In the first trial, analysis of the mean root dry weight across the three treatments showed very significant differences (P<0.001), significant differences occurred between each aquaponic treatment and the control at the P=0.05 level, but not between the two aquaponic treatments (Table 3.3). The control treatment was found to have approximately twice the mean root dry weight of each of the aquaponic treatments. <table/>Upon removal from the substrate-filled gutters, it was immediately apparent at the end of trial 2 that the lettuces grown in the two aquaponic treatments had much more extensive root systems than those from the control treatment. There was however a noticeable colour difference, the roots of the plants grown in the control were bright white and healthy, whilst those from the two aquaponic treatments were generally brown in colour and appeared less healthy. Significant differences were observed in dry root weights between the control and each of the aquaponic treatments (Table 4.4). At P=0.05, ANOVA testing showed no significant difference in mean root dry weight between the two aquaponic treatments. After the third trial significant differences were only observed between the control and the aquaponic + Fe treatment at P=0.05. Analysis of mean dry root weight after the fourth trial failed to show significant differences in between the two remaining treatments (P=0.737). <heading>Chlorophyll content</heading>Although the two aquaponic treatments gave slightly higher mean leaf chlorophyll content readings in the first trial, on analysis of the data, no significant differences were observed between the three treatments (P=0.728) (Figure 3.13). Analysis of data from the second trial, however, showed significant differences in mean leaf chlorophyll content between the control and aquaponic treatments, the control and aquaponic + Fe treatments, and also between the two aquaponic treatments themselves (lsd = 0.60 at P=0.05) (Figure 3.14).. <figure/><figure/>In the third growth trial, the highest mean chlorophyll content was observed in the control treatment. There were significant differences between the control values and each of the aquaponic treatments (P=0.05 lsd=0.534) but not between the aquaponic and aquaponic + Fe treatments (Figure 3.15). <figure/>In the final trial, the lowest chlorophyll content levels of the project were recorded, with plants from both treatments having mean values below 3.5 (Figure 3.16). There was no significant difference between the two treatments (P=0.107). <figure/><heading>Leaf tissue composition</heading>Dried leaf tissue samples were analysed by NRM laboratories for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium percentage by weight (w/w) for each treatment. Samples representing each separate system were prepared from trials 2 and 4 as growth rates in the control and aquaponic treatment(s) were most similar in these trials. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in total leaf nitrogen concentration across treatments in either the second or final growth trial. The total nitrogen content was higher in plants from the control treatment in trial 2 whereas in trial 4 the aquaponic treatment produced plants with the highest leaf nitrogen content (Figure 3.17). <figure/><figure/>Control treatment leaf tissue samples from the second growth trial contained significantly higher phosphorus concentrations than each of the aquaponic treatments (Figure 3.18) but there was no significant difference between the aquaponic treatments (lsd = 0.098 at P=0.05). In trial 4, the leaf phosphorus content was higher in the aquaponic treatment, but not significantly. <figure/>In trial 2, mean potassium concentrations in plants from the control treatment were significantly higher than those in plants form each aquaponic treatment, but no significant differences were observed between the aquaponic treatments themselves (Figure 3.19, lsd =2.125 at P=0.05). No significant differences in leaf potassium concentration were apparent in trial 4. <heading>Pests, diseases and signs of deficiency</heading>Several plants in systems 3 and 4 suffered caterpillar damage during the second week of the first trial (Figure 3.20). Owing to the low vigour with which these plants were growing, two were unable to recover and thus were omitted from the results. <picture/><picture/>The leaves of lettuces in the two aquaponic treatments were noticeably thicker and more brittle in the first trial. Furthermore, some of these plants also displayed spotting in the leaf surfaces. These appeared as small necrotic patches on closer inspection and occurred both within the inter-venal areas of the leaf lamina and on the veins and midribs themselves (Figure 3.21). During the third growth trial, a number of small flies were observed on all plants and several translucent larvae approximately 5-10mm in length were observed in the sludge that had accumulated amongst the substrate in the aquaponic systems (solid fish waste). Visible larvae were removed and the systems monitored closely but no damage became apparent. <heading>Discussion</heading>The design of the systems proved robust enough to support the growth of both lettuce and fish. Only two fish were lost over the period of the project, and those surviving approximately doubled in size over the duration of the project with no symptoms of disease. The plants were able to remove nutrients from the aquaria water and, where enough fish were present to produce sufficient nutrients, growth rates were comparable to the control treatment. The increasing electro-conductivity of the aquaria water, did however suggest that some dissolved nutrients were not being removed in the aquaponic systems at the rate at which they were being produced. This may have resulted from the lack of faeces removal, and its subsequent mineralization. The pH of the water in all aquaponic systems followed a downward trend over the project, this resulted from the action of nitrifying bacteria, the dissolution of CO 2 from fish respiration in tank water to form carbonic acid, and also from the bacterial breakdown of faeces and uneaten food to form other organic acids (Randall no date). It is fair to assume that longer-term aquaponic projects of this nature may require the addition of buffers to mitigate this acidification. The use of domestic goldfish in this project necessitated low densities of fish per unit volume of water. The size of the fish in the trial was not closely monitored, however those surviving until the end of the project had approximately doubled in size. One of these fish, which appeared to be representative of an average size at the end of the project was weighed. A unit weight of 18.7g was recorded, meaning that the total weight of fish in each tank during trials 1-3 and trial 4 equated to 2.14kg m -3 and 4.27kg m -3 respectively. When compared to commercial stocking densities up to 17 kg m -3 in the UVI systems and up to 100kg m -3 in super-intensive aquaculture systems (Lucas & Southgate 2003) the aquaponic crop growth rates observed in this project, especially in trials 2 and 4 must be seen as encouraging. The brands of fish food used during the project contained approximately 40% protein. In turn, proteins consist of around 16% nitrogen (Wurts, 2005). In a commercial system, where the food conversion ratio of a fish species is known, it is possible to estimate how much protein will be converted to fish biomass and how much will enter the water as ammonia. However, these calculations can be further complicated when the conversion of ammonia to nitrates is considered, with the rate of nitrification being dependent upon water temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (Stickney 2005). The growth of plants in the aquaponic treatments was up to ten times lower than the control plants in the first three trials. In addition, appearance of the plants in these treatments during the first trial suggested some nutrient deficiencies; the leaves of the plants were thicker and more brittle than those in the control treatment. Their dark green appearance and the generally stunted growth was consistent with a phosphorus deficiency (Jones 1997; Salisbury and Ross 1992). As aquaria nitrate concentrations did not rise above 40 ppm during the first three trials, it is also reasonable to suggest this low rate of growth was also significant of nitrogen deficiency. It is worthy of note, however, that no chlorosis was observed, often apparent in plants starved of nitrogen (ibid). Other than the above, there were no other outward signs of mineral deficiencies. The use of mains water, which contains traces of both macro- and micro-nutrients (Thames Water 2005) (Appendix 3), twinned with the lack of solids-removal may help to explain this. Leaf tissue analysis of plants from the aquaponic treatments in trials 2 and 4 showed concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the normal range for lettuce (Jones 2003). Whilst leaf concentrations of phosphorus and potassium are good indicators of the levels of these elements available to the plant, excess available nitrogen can lead to 'luxury uptake' (Greenwood et al 1980). It is worth noting that in the final trial, the aquaponic treatment showed higher leaf tissue concentrations of nitrogen than the control treatment, presumably because the nitrate levels in this treatment did not fall as rapidly as those in the control, exposing the plants to more nitrogen over the 21 days. In temperate zones where there are periods of low light during the year, the propensity for leafy salads to store excess nitrogen as NO 3- means that lettuce are routinely tested for nitrate concentration (Assured Produce 1997). The possibility of higher nitrate concentrations in aquaponically-produced lettuce may therefore be in need of further investigation. Root to shoot ratio in the second and third trials were higher in the aquaponics treatments than in the control, suggesting a lack of available nutrients. Salisbury & Ross (1992) imply that this is most indicative of low nitrogen availability, which is borne out by low recorded NO 3- concentrations in the fish tanks of these treatments during these trials compared to the control tanks. Low levels of root production in the aquaponic treatments in trial 1 may also be indicative of low phosphorus availability at that early stage in the project. Small necrotic spots surrounded by a yellow halo were also observed on the plants from the aquaponic treatments (Figure 3.21), which was identified as an early infection of Xanthomonus campestris (Agrios 2005). Whilst necrotic lesions can also be indicative of magnesium deficiency, the symptoms were not confined to inter-venal regions, and thus the initial diagnosis was accepted. The control plants did not show any sign of such infection, one possible reason being the vigour with which they were growing. The brown appearance of the roots of plants from the aquaponic treatments in the second trial would seem to suggest that there may have been at least some occurrence of anoxic pockets of water within the substrate, causing root death. Sampling of the dissolved oxygen in the irrigation water (when the water temperature was 17 °C) showed levels of approximately 8mg l -1. This is within the desired range for freshwater aquaria and well above the minimum levels acceptable for good growth in hydroponic crops (Goto et al 1996). Continuous flow systems through a substrate can lead to the water taking a 'path of least resistance' through the particles with some areas flooded but not moving. In such areas, denitrification (nitrate reduced to nitrogen gas) can even occur. Such a phenomenon would perhaps explain why some root tissue appeared necrotic. The root systems of these plants tended also to trap solid fish excreta and hence impede the flow of oxygenated water past the roots, possibly another reason for the root death. Dense root mats can be problematic in conventional Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) hydroponics where they can also starve themselves of oxygen by reducing solution penetration into the root mass (Jones 1997) The fluctuations in nitrate content of the aquaria water during the first three trials would appear to suggest that the fish stocking rates and hence feed input were insufficient to produce the amount of nitrogen required by the plants. However, during the third trial, nitrate levels remained at 40 ppm for the entire trial. During this period (early October) day temperatures in the glasshouse were noticeably lower than in previous trials (Appendix 4). The corresponding fall in water temperature in the aquaria may have reduced the feeding rate of the fish, meaning less protein from the food was converted to fish biomass and more uneaten food may have merely decomposed than in previous trials. The lower temperatures also corresponded to lower rates of plant growth, and thus less demand for nitrogen, although nitrate concentrations in the control systems did fall in line with the two previous trials. Higher growth rates (although not significantly) were observed in the aquaponic + Fe treatments in the first two trials but not in the third. Furthermore, only in the second trial did the addition if iron to the aquaponic systems have a significant effect on leaf chlorophyll content. The addition of iron did not therefore appear to have any consistent significant effect during the project. Plants are able to grow well in soilless systems where mineral concentrations are as low as those in soil solutions, as long as the nutrients can be replenished at a comparable rate to their uptake (Salisbury and Ross 1992). This continual renewal is central to the success of an aquaponic system, where levels of nitrate, for example remain much lower than those found in conventional hydroponics. From a fish-rearing perspective, treatment of aquaculture effluents are seen as problematic, especially in open systems, as the large volume flows carry relatively dilute nutrients (Adler et al 2000). Rackocy (no date) and Lennard (2004) have demonstrated the ability of aquaponic systems to produce leafy herbs when nitrate levels are as low as 40 ppm. It is theoretically possible to match nutrient production to nutrient uptake (at least for nitrogen) and thus for aquaponic systems to reach a nutrient equilibrium (Lennard 2004). Plant scientists generally acknowledge the possibility that organic compounds such as vitamins can have a positive effect on plant growth (Salisbury and Ross 1992). The importance of chelating agents in the uptake of nutrients, especially relatively immobile ones, is also widely known, and in soils it is known that these chelating agents are often of microbial origin (ibid). Commercially available bio-stimulants for use in soilless systems aim to enhance inorganic nutrient uptake in a similar way and indeed, Vernieri et al (2006) proved the capability of one such substance to maintain yields of rocket (Eruca sativa) when the nutrient content in a hydroponic system was reduced to 25% of normal levels. In aquaponic systems, the understanding of the action of micro-organisms in the production of bio-stimulants is growing. The action of micro-organism-derived chelating agents as well as humic compounds from the breakdown of solid waste may well be a key factor in the success of aquaponics. Savidov (2006 cited in Wilson 2006) has highlighted the need for aquaponic systems to 'mature' in order to produce economic crop yields. The speed at which the system reaches this maturity would obviously be important to any business application of the technique. The aquaponic systems in this project began to produce comparable yields to the hydroponic control after approximately four months of operation. The decision not to remove solid fish waste may have been important in achieving this as the organic particles can act as carriers for bacteria and other beneficial micro-fauna (Kolkovski et al 2003) Aquaculture-derived manure has been cited as a useful slow-release fertiliser (Westerman et al 1993). Naylor et al (1999) analysed fresh trout-farm manure, finding levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium (Mg) on a dry-weight basis comparable with cattle, poultry and swine manures. The amount of solid particles present in the system is also linked to the dissolved oxygen concentration, with the aerobic breakdown of excreta and uneaten food increasing the amount of oxygen removed from the water. This is the main reason why systems that are intensively stocked with fish, such as that of the UVI, remove solids (Rackocy no date). Over the project as a whole, there were much lower levels of water use in the aquaponic systems. Whilst the control systems required a 100% water change between trials as well as supplementary water to replace that lost through evapotranspiration, the aquaponic systems only required the latter. Each aquaponic system thus used approximately 75% less water than the control. <heading>Conclusion</heading>The project demonstrated the ability of aquaponic systems to produce lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. 'Trinity') using goldfish (Carassius auratus) aquaria as the nutrient source albeit at a slower rate than the control hydroponic treatment. The rate at which lettuce can be produced in these systems related directly to the amount of food added to the aquatic portion of the systems, which would normally be in direct relation to the stocking density of the fish used. Although the hydroponic control treatments produced a greater crop yield in three of the four trials, it is worth considering the amount of water used and the cost in terms of financial outlay for the inorganic nutrients and in terms of the energy used to produce these chemicals. Aquaponic systems also have the advantage of producing two saleable products and, as has been demonstrated in the United States, the possibility of generating further income from agri-tourism. Although there are obvious benefits to producing crops using aquaponic systems, the likelihood of commercial-scale aquaponic production occurring in the UK in the near future must be seen as unlikely. It is possible however, that large increases in energy costs and restrictions on water use and pollution discharge may make such techniques more important in years to come. <heading>Future Work</heading>It was apparent towards the end of this project that the expanded clay aggregate bio-filters/grow-beds were not large enough to cope with 5 months of goldfish faeces. It became necessary during the later trials to periodically remove the plug at the end of the irrigation hose to remove some solids from the pipe. Larger, deeper bio-filters would therefore enable the retention of more soild waste and possibly, therefore higher concentrations of micronutrients and micro-organisms. Lennard and Leonard (2006) assessed the comparative abilities of gravel bed, floating raft and NFT hydroponic systems to remove fish-derived nutrients in an aquaponics system, concluding gravel beds worked most efficiently. Combinations of grow-bed volume and various substrates could therefore be trialled along with the removal or retention of fish faeces. Now suggested as being an important factor in aquaponic systems, populations of water borne micro flora and micro fauna take some time to establish. Savidov (2006 in Wilson 2006) has suggested that for populations of these organisms to reach useful size may take up to twelve months, and that from that point forward aquaponics can outperform conventional hydroponics in terms of crop yield. A full investigation of these theories is currently under way by Savidov (Wilson 2006), however the limited time-scale for this project must be cited as a major limiting factor in view of these preliminary hypotheses. Possibly, future research could assess the effects of commercially-available plant boistimulants in aquaponics where 'virgin' aquaculture systems are used to provide crop nutrition. Finally, the increasing need to reduce energy consumption also presents the possibility of using warm water fish production alongside glasshouse crops to store excess heat during periods of high temperatures to reduce the need for night-time heating.
