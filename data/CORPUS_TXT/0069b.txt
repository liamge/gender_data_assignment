Lord Denning is regarded as having been one of the most radical members of the English judiciary, as shown by his enthusiasm to employ the judicial power of legislating in his decision-making, where he saw fit. Known as "the people's judge", Denning is considered one of the most popular adjudicators, with Lord Woolf praising his "...extraordinary ability in his judgements to reflect the sense of justice of the public at large...", and yet is also one of the most heavily criticised for his susceptibility to reach thoroughly unconventional decisions that created only short-lived precedent. <fnote>as per Lord Woolf, published in web-based BBC News report found at  URL  </fnote>When looking at certain Property Law cases that came before Denning, we can see how the liberal approach he adopted made his decision-making seem sympathetic to persons in residential occupation. Such tendencies led him to some radical and controversial decisions, criticised by his peers for their propensity to potentially 'clog' titles of residential property by creating an excessive number of interests which would lead to impracticalities and insecurities in conveyancing transactions. In the following paragraphs, I will endeavour to evaluate the impact such decisions had on the rights of those in residential occupation. In order to do this, we must first establish what the traditional legal positions were in relation to determining those rights, before investigating how Denning's decisions revised the positions, and concluding whether they had a lasting impact on them. <heading>(i) Contractual Licences </heading>A fundamental issue that Denning dealt with in relation to contractual licences was whether or not such a right to occupation could become an interest in land and thus bind third parties. The established legal position was that a contractual licence was not an interest in land as it is revocable, merely bestowing a personal and not a proprietary right on the licensee and therefore does not bind third parties. Authority for this rule can be found at case law. In King v. David Allen & Sons, Billposting Ltd, King and Allen entered a contractual agreement which gave the latter a licence to display posters on the walls of a cinema owned by King, who later leased the cinema to a third party. They demanded that Allen should discontinue displaying the posters. The House of Lords regarded the contract as creating nothing more than a personal obligation, bestowing rights capable of binding only on those party to it. It was not an interest in land that would have otherwise bound the new lessee to Allen's right to occupation. In Clore v. Theatrical Properties Ltd. , the court held that the contractual agreement which gave Clore "exclusive use of all the refreshment rooms of a theatre" was merely a licence rather than a lease. Consequently, it was held that contractual licences were not capable of binding a third party, even with notice, thus furthering the rule established in King v. David Allen. <fnote>as established by the cases of Wood v. Leadbitter (1835) 13 M. & W. 838, and Hurst v. Picture Theatres Ltd. [1915] 1 K.B. 1 </fnote><fnote>[1916] 2 A.C. 54, HL </fnote><fnote>[1936] 3 All E.R. 483 </fnote>However, Lord Denning's reasoning in the case of Errington v. Errington and Woods initiated the development of a controversial theory, which suggested that a contractual licence could in fact be 'elevated to the status of a proprietary right', despite the established precedent to the contrary. In this case, an agreement was made whereby a father promised to convey his house to his son and daughter-in-law, who lived in it, provided the couple paid all the mortgage instalments. When the father died, his widow inherited the house and sought possession against the couple, who had indeed paid the instalments in accordance with their agreement. In holding that the couple should maintain their right to occupation, Denning reached an unconventional decision. The ratio for this was that equity had stepped in to ensure the couple's contractual license could not be revoked, as they had acted upon their agreement to their detriment. This equity, Denning argued, had 'fused' with the law so as to give them an equitable interest in land that thus bound the widow seeking possession; essentially: "The infusion of equity means that contractual licences now have a force and validity of their own" that can only be disregarded by a "purchaser without notice". Denning's decision had thus created a new interest in land, seemingly going against both precedent and s.4(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 which attempts to restrict such expansionary decision-making for the benefit of facilitating the conveyance of land. It therefore also seemed to contradict the fundamental principle that licences are thus classified "precisely as they do not qualify as other recognised interests in the land, such as leases and easements"? <fnote>[1952] 1 K.B. 90. </fnote><fnote>'Modern Land Law' - Mark P. Thompson, p. 489, 2nd ed., 2003, OUP. </fnote><fnote>[1952] 1 K.B. at 299 per Denning L.J. </fnote><fnote>'Modern Land Law' - Thompson, p. 489, 2nd ed., 2003, OUP </fnote>Disapproval of Denning's decision seems abundant, yet despite such criticism, his argument that contractual licences could create interests in land persisted for some years, being upheld, although reluctantly, in the cases of  Re Sharpe and Midland Bank Ltd. v. Farmpride Hatcheries Ltd . Notably, Denning's argument is well reiterated, and developed, in the case of Binions v. Evans. Here, Mrs. Evans entered into an agreement with Tredegar Estates allowing her to continue to live rent free in a cottage, owned by the Estate, for the rest of her life, provided she simply maintained the house and garden to a good degree. Binions purchased the cottage from the Estate at a reduced price and, crucially, under express conditions that recognised Evans' right of occupation, and later attempted to seek possession against her. The action failed; the majority in the Court of Appeal decided that Evans was a tenant for life by virtue of her agreement with the Estate, which they felt had given her life interest in the property. Because Binions had evidently taken notice of this, he was bound to her interest. However, in adopting the rationale he developed in Errington and by emphasising the significance of upholding the "true intent of the parties" which seemingly were not to give Evans the significant statutory powers given to her as a tenant for life, Denning argued that Evans' agreement should be construed as an irrevocable contractual licence, thus giving her an equitable interest in the land. This licence, he argued, should be protected by the imposition of a constructive trust as Binions had expressly agreed to allow Evans' right upon purchase; therefore it would have been inequitable to later deny her this. <fnote>[1980] 1 W.L.R. 219 </fnote><fnote>[1981] E.G.L.R. 147 </fnote><fnote>[1972] 1 Ch. 359. </fnote><fnote>v. Errington & Woods [1952] 1 K.B. 290, CA </fnote><fnote>[1972] 1 p. 340 per Lord Denning, M.R. </fnote>However, as the reservations of Browne-Wilkinson in Re Sharpe indicate, such changes that Denning was instigating were seen to be distorting a worthy and well-established precedent, rather than addressing shortcomings in this section of property law. His impact on contractual licensee's rights to occupation was finally negated by the Court of Appeal in Ashburn Anstalt v. Arnold. This case necessitated a full review of the status of contractual licences. The Court of Appeal considered the doctrine established in Errington, stipulating that contractual licences were binding upon all but a purchaser without notice, and deemed it had been decided per incuriam and was thus wrong. It further instructed that contractual licences would no longer give rise to proprietary interests, emphasising the importance of establishing clarity between proprietary rights and mere contractual obligations. The policy aim of maintaining certainty and security in the conveyance of land, by keeping a lid on property rights arising from informal arrangements, clearly came into play here, overriding these seemingly 'unauthorised' attempts at furthering the rights of those in residential occupation which Denning had made. <fnote>"I do not think that the principles lying behind these decisions have been fully explored and on occasion it seems such rights are found to exist seemingly on the ground that to hold otherwise would be a hardship to the plaintiff" - Browne-Wilkinson J. in Re Sharpe [1980] 1 W.L.R. at 223. </fnote><fnote>[1989] Ch. 1. </fnote><fnote>v. Errington and Woods [1952] 1 K.B. 90 </fnote><heading>(ii) Matrimonial Home Rights and the "deserted wife's equity". </heading>Traditionally, the courts considered that in a matrimonial home conveyed solely in the name of the husband, the wife's right to occupation was that of a mere licence, revocable at any time. In legal terms, this meant that if the husband 'deserted' his wife and sold the house to a third party seeking possession, she could be left without residence as her right to occupation was not binding. During the 1950's, however, a controversial line of authority developed which indicated that the deserted wife could have a right in equity to remain in occupation. Characteristically fighting on behalf of those in danger of unjustly losing their rights to occupation, Lord Denning furthered the doctrine of the 'deserted wife's equity' in the case of National Provincial Bank v. Hastings Car Mart Ltd. , extending the ideas he developed in relation to informal arrangements creating binding equitable rights of occupation. He held that a wife, who had been deserted by her bankrupt husband, could remain in possession of the house held in his name, despite her lack of legal justification to do so. He argued the wife had "a licence coupled with an equity", which the courts would enforce against the bank seeking possession against her. Denning clearly found it unconscionable that the desertion of a husband could leave his wife and family homeless simply on the grounds that she had no legal estate or equitable interest in the land, referring to his decision as showing "mercy to the wife". <fnote>Mainly in the decisions in Bendall v. McWhirter [1952] 2 Q.B. 406 and Street v. Denham [1954] 1 W.L.R. 624. </fnote><fnote>[1964] Ch. 665 </fnote><fnote>in Errington v. Errington & Woods [1952] 1 K.B. 90 and Binions v. Evans [1972] 1 Ch. 359 </fnote><fnote>National Provincial Bank v. Hastings Car Mart Ltd. [1964] Ch. 665 at p.691. </fnote>The decision of the House of Lords a mere year later in National Provincial Bank v. Ainsworth rejected this idea of 'deserted wife's equity'. It was held that there was no such right known to law and, therefore, that third parties could not be bound to it. The courts once again seemed adamant to restrict the abundance of binding rights to ensure security in conveyancing transactions. However, it appeared Denning had done enough to necessitate a legislative response from Parliament in order to reconcile this situation that was seen as leaving wives in an 'unacceptably exposed position'. Under the terms of the Matrimonial Homes Act 1967, and later the Family Law Act 1996, a non-owning spouse was given the statutory right to occupation of the home (if not in possession), or to avoid eviction from it. If registered, these would be binding on a third party and a trustee in bankruptcy. <fnote>[1965] A.C. 1175 </fnote><fnote>'Modern Land Law' - Thompson, p. 78, 2nd ed., 2003, OUP </fnote>Lord Denning's legacy thus seemed maintained. However, upon closer inspection of the legislation, we can see how the rights it created for non-owning spouses are not as easily available to them as Denning had perhaps intended. The right operates as a Class F Land Charge which must be registered against the name of the legal owner as it appears on the deed that consigns the property to them, in accordance with the Land Registration Act 1925, in order to bind purchasers. Unless the non-owning spouse is under legal advisement, it is unlikely that they would know the necessity of taking such measures to establish their binding right of occupancy. In registered land, the right cannot be overriding and so a notice of rights must be entered so as to bind third parties. Furthermore, under s.33 of the 1996 Act, the court retains the ability to regulate the statutory right. Removal is thus at their discretion. In Kashmir Kaur v. Gill it was held that the non-owning spouse's right to occupation had been extinguished by the successful application for her exclusion, made by a purchaser with notice of her right, as the courts were prepared to take into account 'all the circumstances of the case', including those of the purchaser. Although the case of Wroth v. Tyler indeed shows the potential of the non-owning spouse's statutory right to effectively veto a proposed transaction, through its registration as a land charge, it more so illuminates the fragile nature of this right in the sense that it is dependant on the circumstances of the legal-owner (the owner's bankruptcy led to the dissolution of the wife's right) and can be removed if the court deems the registration was simply made out of spite. <fnote>Strictness of this is illuminated in Diligent Finance Co. Ltd. v. Alleyne (1972) 23 P. & C.R. 346 </fnote><fnote>[1988] Fam. 110. </fnote><fnote>[1974] Ch. 30 </fnote>Although the imposition of legislation can largely be attributed to Denning, the reform it had on the law was evidently moderate. The issue seemed to have come full circle; from Denning's initial theory of bestowing rights, ad hoc, on non-owning spouses, to Parliament's retention of authority to restrict or terminate such rights. Denning's impact, therefore, seems to have been limited. <heading>(iii) Acquiring Beneficial Interests in land </heading>A key problem which the courts have had to address in numerous property cases is that of determining "who owns what", after the breakdown of a relationship between co-habitees leaves the non-owning party in need of establishing their beneficial interest in the land. The controversy of Lord Denning's unorthodox decisions reappears here, most noticeably in relation to his theory of the 'New Model Constructive Trust'. <fnote>'Modern Land Law' - Thompson, p. 254, 2nd ed., 2003, OUP </fnote><fnote>in his own words: "a contructive trust of a new model", per Lord Denning in Eves v. Eves [1975] 1 WLR 1338, at 1341. </fnote>The Married Woman's Property Act 1882 caters for situations involving the breakdown of marriages. Under section 17., spouses can apply to the courts for a settlement for deciphering ownership of disputed "family assets". In Hine v. Hine, Lord Denning M.R. argued that the courts would have discretionary use of this section, in allocating shares of such assets, in cases where the acquisition of property was achieved by joint efforts (which he argued would include non-financial contributions such as child-care). This approach, typical of Denning, was firmly rejected by the House of Lords in Pettitt v. Pettitt. It was held that section 17 was procedural in nature, confirming that discretion should not be afforded to the judiciary when deciding upon the allocation of family assets. Denning's simplistic approach was held to be incapable of promoting certainty at law, and therefore failed to achieve any lasting impact on the rights of residential occupiers. <fnote>[1962] 1 W.L.R. 1124 </fnote><fnote>[1970] A.C. 777 </fnote>Notwithstanding this rejection of his discretionary approach, Denning made further challenges to authority in relation to acquiring trusts in land, leading to the development of his own doctrine. However, this fell under heavy criticism both in England and across the Commonwealth for being devoid of any concurrence with precedent and for its "total uncertainty of application and result". Perhaps inevitably so, this was once again extinguished by subsequent decisions in the House of Lords. <fnote>Mahon J. considered the development of Denning's doctrine to have been "a simple violation of the principle of 'stare decisis'", in Avondale Printers and Stationers Ltd. v. Haggie [1979] 2 NZLR 124, at 152 </fnote><fnote>Carly v. Far </fnote>The problematic types of trust with which Denning was concerned were resulting and constructive trusts. In cases where parties had not given an express declaration of ownership, the courts would be inclined to ascertain whether or not such trusts should be implemented through inference of the intentions of the parties or from their financial contributions to the acquisition of the property. In Gissing v. Gissing, the House of Lords held that a wife's expenditure on furnishings, clothes and lawn-laying, was an insufficient financial contribution to acquire a beneficial interest in the matrimonial home Her husband had funded both the deposit and the mortgage instalments, thus the courts saw no possibility of inferring an agreement between the parties under which the wife could claim an interest in the land. It was discussed that only a financial contribution to the acquisition of the property would suffice as an indication to create a beneficial interest in the home, through a constructive trust. The courts attempted clarify which financial contributions they would consider to justify imposing a constructive trust. These were restricted to substantial direct financial or indirect financial contributions; the former relating to cash fronted for purchase or mortgage instalments for example, the latter to those which facilitate the acquisition of property to such an extent that without them, the purchase could not occur. This clearly precludes non-financial contributions which are most often made by women, meaning all unpaid efforts made to maintain the house and its inhabitants are disregarded - a bias against women that Lord Denning would not tolerate. <fnote>indeed, an essential factor of Lord Denning's reformist approach was that he saw no need for establishing differences in such trusts: "the two run together", per Lord Denning in Hussey v. Palmer [1972] 1 W.L.R. 1286 at 1289. </fnote><fnote>which if made in accordance with section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act would provide a decisive indication as to what the beneficial interests are in the property under consideration. </fnote><fnote>Based on rationale established by Lord Diplock's dictum in Gissing v. Gissing [1971] A.C. 886, at 905: "A resulting, implied or constructive trust...is created by a transaction between the legal trustee and the cestui que trust in connection with the acquisition by the trustee of a legal estate in land, whenever the trustee has so conducted himself that it would be inequitable...to deny the cestui que trust a beneficial interest in the land acquired". </fnote><fnote>[1971] A.C. 886 </fnote><fnote>Ibid., per Lord Pearson at 903, per Lord Diplock at 909 </fnote>In Hussey v. Palmer, Denning launched his attack on the existing position, armed with his idea of a new model constructive trust which he ascertained would be imposed "whenever justice and good conscience require it", based on a test relating to the reasonable person's perception of the situation. He accepted here that Mrs. Hussey's payment of £607 to her son son-in-law, for the building of her bedroom extension in his house, could amount to a beneficial interest, based on arguments of equity intervening so as to reverse the unjust enrichment of the son-in-law. Thus, Denning reintroduced the broader discretionary approach to determining beneficial interests which he had hinted at in his earlier decisions in Falconer v. Falconer and Smith v. Baker, in attempt to displace reference to financial contributions to acquisition of property in decision making. In Hall v. Hall, this approach was adopted explicitly. The court fashioned a discretionary trust, having shown its willingness to take into account "all the circumstances" including non-financial contributions of "keeping up the house" and looking after children, in contrast to the much narrower, traditional approach. <fnote>[1972] 1 W.L.R. 1286 </fnote><fnote>(He had refused to reimburse Hussey after her departure from his residence due to quarrels between them). </fnote><fnote>[1970] 1 W.L.R. 1333 - Denning suggested that substantial financial contributions to family expenses could be sufficient to infer a trust. </fnote><fnote>[1970] 1 W.L.R. 1160 </fnote><fnote>Hazell v. Hazell [1972] 1 W.L.R. 301 at 302-304 per Lord Denning M.R. </fnote><fnote>[1982] 3 F.L.R. 379 </fnote><fnote>Ibid., at 381 </fnote>However, as indicated earlier, Denning's controversial conception of trusts was finally put to rest, as criticisms manifested themselves in some crushing decisions made in later cases, resulting in an return to orthodoxy that remained largely unchallenged thanks to Denning's retirement. In Burns v. Burns, the Court of Appeal found no sympathy for a woman who had both cared for her and her partner's children, and made continual financial contributions to bill-paying and house maintenance. In unanimously rejecting her claim to a beneficial interest in the house, it re-established the principles adhered to in Gissing v. Gissing, re-instating the substantial financial contribution test and firmly rejecting the broader perspective adopted in Hall v. Hall. The House of Lords furthered the restoration of the traditional approach in Lloyds Bank plc v. Rossett, by holding that a woman's physical work in renovating the property was not capable of acquiring her a constructive trust, notwithstanding that such work had been carried out under the assumption that purchase of the house had been a 'joint venture'. Judicial discretion in relation to determining trusts was also removed, in Spring v. Defoe, whereby Dillon LJ dissolved the more objective approach advocated by Denning. <fnote>[1984] Ch. 317 </fnote><fnote>[1991] A.C. 107 </fnote><fnote>[1992] 2 F.L.R. 388 </fnote><fnote>Ibid., at 393 "[t]he Court does not as yet...exercise a general discretion to do what the man in the street, on a general overview of the case, might regard as fair". Per Dillon LJ </fnote>Although the courts were still willing to infer intentions as to creating beneficial rights, the strict tests for establishing the existence of such intentions were reintroduced, thus substantial direct financial contribution re-acquired its place as essentially being the only way from which such interests could be inferred. As expressed by Oakley, "it is unlikely that much more will be heard of Hussey v. Palmer". Denning was thus seemingly unable to have any lasting impact on occupier's rights in this area, in the way he had intended. However, calls for reform of the law of trusts are manifesting themselves, and so it remains to be seen if a balance can be struck, through legislation, between the traditional approach and that developed by Lord Denning. Indeed, the courts of Canada have seemingly taken Denning's model into consideration and moulded his doctrine somewhat so as to adhere to a more balanced perspective on the law of trusts. <fnote>'Constructive Trusts' - Oakley, p.44, 2nd ed., 1987, Sweet & Maxwell </fnote><fnote>for example in Sorochan v. Sorochan [1986] D.L.R. (4th) 1. and Peter v. Beblow[1993] 101 D.L.R. (4th) 621 </fnote><heading>Conclusions</heading>It is clear from this investigation that Lord Denning's affinity for reaching decisions based on what, above all, he believes do justice  between the parties before him, created some radical doctrines in the law of property, which were seemingly extinguished at the first opportunity by the House of Lords. However, Denning's decisions can be seen to have had some lasting impact, in the way that they revealed certain shortcomings of the established law, which Parliament and the House of Lords, in determining future cases, were inclined to take note of. They have thus incorporated some of Denning's controversial innovations into legislation and their decision-making, albeit to a more diluted extent of what Denning initially intended. These rationalisations of Denning's, often 'precedent-defying' decisions, are clearly apparent in cases dealing with matrimonial home rights and constructive trusts, and to some degree in those involving contractual licences that, largely thanks to Denning, can give rise to constructive trusts. In conclusion, the rights of persons in residential occupation have seemingly benefited from Lord Denning's decisions to some extent, although the potential reform in certain areas leaves us contemplating whether these interests will continue to be protected in the absence of Denning's influence. <fnote>'Judging Judges' - Simon Lee, p.127, 1989, Faber and Faber (per Lord Denning himself) </fnote>
