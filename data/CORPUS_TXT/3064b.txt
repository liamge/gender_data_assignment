<heading>Introduction</heading>May is 63 and has a moderate learning disability which means she may have difficulties such as understanding, learning and remembering new things, and in generalising any learning to new situations. She may have difficulties with a number of social tasks, for example communication, self-care and awareness of health and safety. (Northfield, 2001) A moderate learning disability is identified in early childhood and people with a moderate learning disability have an IQ range of 35/40 - 50/55. Cognitive, psychological, social and self management performance components can be affected. A learning disability is a lifelong condition and is non-progressive. The emphasis of intervention is therefore on managing the medical aspects of the condition and helping individuals achieve their highest potential. (Hansen and Atchison, 2000) May attends a social services Day Centre, but she would like to cut down the days she goes from 3 days to 1 because she gets tired. She would like to find some other activities to do which are not too tiring, and which are sociable. <heading>Gather and Analyse Information</heading><heading>Observations of and interview with client: </heading>Spend half a day with May in the Day Centre. Observe her general character and behaviour and what she does at the centre. Talk to her about what she likes and dislikes doing and what activities she is referring to when she says that there are a lot of things she does at the centre, but could do at home. Ask her about getting tired - does she get tired after a mornings activity? Maybe it would be better if she did things in the morning and had the afternoons free, rather than being out for a whole day and getting too tired. Does she health problems? <heading>Interview with May's husband:</heading>What does he do in the day time? Are there some activities or outings he and May could do together sometimes, so they are not cooped up in the house, but participate in a positive activity they can share the experience of. <heading>Information needed from other disciplines:</heading>Day centre staff: What kind of activities does May enjoy doing at the centre? What are her strengths and attributes? Do they have any ideas for activities/outings for May? Why does she tire easily? <heading>Assessments:</heading>Assess client perspective using COPM (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure) to find out May's performance, problems and goals. (Standardised assessment). Carry out an interest checklist with May to determine activities she enjoys, which she could do in her own time or do more of. <heading>Define the Problem</heading><heading>Problem and nature of problem:</heading>Going to the Day Centre 3 days a week - this is too tiring for May and she feels she could do some of the activities she does there, at home. Being at home with her husband too much - they do not get on very well being cooped up together, so need to do other things and go out. <heading>The areas of need for the client:</heading>To find outings and activities which are not too tiring, and are sociable and enjoyable. <heading>Strengths that can be built on:</heading><list>May's desire and enthusiasm to want to go out, see people, enjoy herself and be useful</list><list>Her sociable, chatty nature</list><list>Supportive husband</list><heading>Plan and Prepare Intervention</heading><heading>Long Term Aim:</heading>Volunteer in a local charity shop 2 mornings a week. <heading>Short Term Goals (Progressive):</heading>Visit 3 local charity shops with the OT and talk about what it would be like to volunteer in one. Chose preferred charity shop and ask to volunteer. In 1 week. Help in the charity shop for 1 morning a week (3 hours) for 2 weeks, sorting clothes and donations, helping other staff at the till and talking to customers. With no problems. Help in the charity shop for 2 mornings a week (3 hours each), for 2 weeks, sorting clothes and donations, helping other staff at the till and talking to customers. With no problems. <heading>Notes on choice of goals:</heading>The activities May did at the centre, but said she could do at home are knitting, watching television and listening to the radio. She can do these in her time at home and has no problems with these activities. (Her knitting can also have a purpose other than being a leisure activity, and she can knit small items to sell in the charity shop.) The long term goal is therefore focused on an activity May can do away from the house. Her strengths and attributes mentioned by the Day Centre staff and observed and assessed by the OT are her social and chatty nature and her enthusiasm to go out and do new things and feel helpful. Working in a charity shop will enable her to see many different people, it should not be too tiring, and it is flexible. It will give her a new occupational role and help her gain new skills, such as learning about money, and developing her people skills with the public. <heading>Implement Intervention</heading>This intervention plan is based on the occupational behaviour frame of reference which focuses on the importance of occupation and having a balanced variety of occupational roles. The focus of attention is on the way the client spends their time during the week. (Creek, 2001). The long term aim can be discussed with the Day Centre staff to see if they are happy with the chosen activity, and therefore for May to cut down the days she goes from the centre from 3 days to 1. Short term goal number 1) enables the OT to explain to May what will be involved in volunteering in a charity shop and May can then chose the charity shop she most prefers and ask to volunteer there. If they do not need a volunteer, the goal will have to be adapted and she will have to ask in another charity shop. Short term goals 2) and 3) can be adapted by reducing the hours May volunteers if it proves too tiring. Or they can be graded, and she could start by working for 1 Â½ hours a morning, and then increase it to 3 hours. <heading>Evaluate Outcomes</heading>Has May's long term goal been reached and her wishes met? Interview May, her husband and the Day Centre staff to see how they feel about May's new routine, if there are any problems and if she is enjoying volunteering in the charity shop. Grade or adapt goals as necessary. Repeat COPM to assess and compare May's perspective of her performance, problems and goals prior to and after intervention.
