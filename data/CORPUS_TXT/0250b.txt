<abstract><heading>Summary</heading>The principle objective of this report is to design and build a cantilever beam-type force sensor, to measure an output voltage in terms of a loading force. A cantilever rig is used, incorporating two active strain gauges. When the resistance of the gauges changes under load, a Wheatstone bridge circuit is utilised to convert this resistance change into a voltage. Finally a non-inverting operational amplifier circuit is introduced to the system to amplify the bridge voltage to a degree which can be digitised and analysed. The output voltage is found to follow an approximate linear relationship with the input load, and the designed system offers a sensitivity value of 12.5 V/N. It is believed that the sensitivity of the system could be improved by upgrading the gauge material at an extra cost, or by increasing the number of active gauges in the bridge circuit. This reduces one of the biggest sources of error caused by resistance changes due to temperature fluctuations in the bridge. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>The purpose of this report is to design and construct a beam-type instrument for force measurement. The design of the instrument is based upon a ready made cantilever rig, incorporating two strain gauges. The strain variation in the beam under the action of a force alters the resistance of the gauges, which is measured by a wheatstone bridge circuit. The relatively small output voltage from the bridge circuit requires amplification, in order for that signal to be processed, or displayed. After determining the sensitivity of the rig, along with the maximum allowed loading force, the principle objectives are to design a suitable wheatstone bridge circuit and an appropriate amplifier, to provide a suitable voltage level, with a gain of 100-1000, using a standard 741 operational amplifier. <heading>Theory</heading>The cantilever rig used for force measurement is as follows: <picture/><heading>Strain Gauges</heading>A strain gauge is a type of semiconductor whose resistance changes under a strain. The fractional change in the gauge resistance caused by an induced strain is defined as the Gauge Factor, 'G', which represents the strain sensitivity, where:  FORMULA   ~Eqn. 1 In most strain gauges, the gauge factor ranges between 2 and 4. <heading>Wheatstone Bridge Circuits</heading>The purpose of the bridge circuit is to convert a change in resistance to a voltage. A variety of circuits exist, but since the strain gauges are used to measure force measurement, the most common arrangement of bridge circuit, is one using 2 active strain gauges. When the cantilever beam is subjected to a load, each gauge experiences either a tensile or compressive stress depending on the surface which it is attached to. This typical arrangement is shown below: <figure/>The bridge circuit shown in figure 2, is used in the test rig, but with the addition of a potentiometer across terminals B and D. This allows the bridge circuit to be zeroed before any readings are taken. In this circuit, for the bridge to be balanced, it is expected that:  FORMULA  ~Eqn. 2 Where R 1 and R 2 are active strain gauges. If a force now acts on the strain gauges, the resistances R 1 and R 2, will become R 1+ΔR, and R 2- ΔR. In this case, the bridge output voltage can be calculated by:  FORMULA  ~Eqn. 3 For the purpose of simplicity, the bridge circuit can be designed with R 1=R 2=R 3=R 4=R 5 and so eqn.3 is simplified to:  FORMULA  ~Eqn. 4 This gives the bridge circuit output voltage, in terms of the change in gauge resistance, and supply voltage. <heading>Cantilever Beam Arrangement</heading>The cantilever beam used in the laboratory is set up in the following way: <picture/>When the cantilever is loaded by a force 'F'. The gauges experience a strain in accordance with Hooke's Law. This strain is given by:  FORMULA  ~Eqn. 5 <heading>Operational Amplifiers</heading>Since the output from the bridge circuit is very small, an operational amplifier has to be incorporated into the rig, to amplify this voltage to an appropriate level. In order to reach the appropriate voltage level, an amplifier must be designed with a gain of 100-1000. Using a 741 operational amplifier, there are two possible configurations: <picture/>For the purpose of voltage amplification, the non-inverting operational amplifier is the ideal choice, for its very high input impedance (~10 13 Ω), which lowers the input currents, and causes the circuit to behave more like an ideal operational amplifier. The non-inverting amplifier also has a higher gain in comparison to the inverting amplifier. This gain is given by:  FORMULA  ~Eqn. 6 In order to achieve the target gain of 1000, this circuit requires that R1 = 999R2. Using standard resistors, an ideal choice for each resistor is as follows:  FORMULA  <heading>Static Characteristics of Measuring Equipment</heading>Static characteristics are the relationships between output and input of an instrument, which is either constant or changing slowly. As well as being characterised by standard terms such as accuracy and range, the force sensor is also characterised by sensitivity and resolution. Sensitivity is a measure of the change in an output which occurs when the input changes by a given amount:  FORMULA  ~Eqn. 7 Where y = change in output, and x = change in input. The instrument may also be characterised by its Resolution, which is the smallest change in the input which can be registered by the instrument. All of the static characteristics of a measurement system contribute to the accuracy and reliability of the system. <heading>Apparatus and Methods</heading>The following equipment is required for the chosen method of force measurement: <list>Cantilever Rig - Analogue Experimental Transducer (see fig.1 page 3)Standard Ruler - Millimetre IncrementsA Set of Washers - Each Weighing 0.25g9V BatteryDC Power SupplyDigital VoltmeterOscilloscopeBread Board741 Operational AmplifierCapacitorsResistorsMicrosoft Excel Computer Program - For Graph ConstructionLabview Computer Software - For Data AcquisitionData Acquisition Card - 6023E (12-bits A/D)</list>Below is an account of the method taken to construct, test and calibrate the beam-type force sensor. <heading>Cantilever Rig Measurements</heading>The steel cantilever must be measured, along with the position of the strain gauges. The measurements taken are those illustrated in figure 3, page 6. The accuracy of these values is limited by the choice of measuring instrument. The strain produced at the gauges is calculated in terms of the force applied. This is given by equation 5 page 6. The Young's Modulus of the steel is given to be 210GPa. The range of the force sensor is determined by Hooke's Law, with the given fatigue strength of the steel being 540Mpa. <heading>Design of Wheatstone Bridge Circuit</heading>The strain gauges are assumed to be identical, and have a nominal gauge resistance of 1000Ω. The gauge factor is given as G=2.1 and a standard 9V battery is provided as the Bridge power supply. The theoretical balance condition is derived using equation 2 page 5. With the balance condition known, the remaining bridge resistances can be selected. It should be noted that the balance condition is only theoretical due to temperature fluctuations in the system. A potentiometer is incorporated in the bridge, to zero the system. The relationship between the bridge output and the resistance change of the gauges can then be calculated from Equation 4 page 5. <heading>Design of Non-Inverting Amplifier</heading>Once the type of amplifier is selected, the feedback resistances are chosen to provide the required gain as in Equation 6 page 7. The amplifier is tested prior to connection of the bridge circuit, by connecting the amplifier to the oscilloscope. The high gain of the non-inverting amplifier results in a considerable amount of noise present in the signal which is displayed (~50Hz). It is to be noted that the noise present is a source of error in the measurements. Due to the induced noise, a low pass filter is constructed by connecting a capacitor across R 1 in the amplifiers feedback loop. By assuming that RC=0.1 seconds, a capacitor of 100nF is chosen to reduce the noise produced at low frequencies. <heading>Test and Calibration of Force Sensor System</heading>The entire system is constructed and through the use of the potentiometer of the bridge, an initial zero condition is achieved. One washer at a time is added to the end of the cantilever, and the output of the amplifier is recorded. Note also that the output fluctuates as the cantilever oscillates at the instant the load is applied, before settling. The collected data can then be plotted on a graph using MatLab, and a linear fit of the data can be analysed. This allows the sensitivity of the system to be calculated. The force sensor can finally be connected to the data acquisition software, which converts the analogue signal to digital. Tests can be made to determine the dynamic behaviour of the cantilever, such as the stabilising time, and resonant frequency of the system. <heading>Observations and Results</heading>The geometrical dimensions of the cantilever, as shown in figure 3 page 6, are measured as follows: <table/>Using the given value of Young's Modulus (210GPa) and the equation 5, from page 6, the strain produced is calculated in terms of the force applied as:  FORMULA  Using the above expression, and the given fatigue strength (540MPa), the maximum loading force is given by:  FORMULA   FORMULA  For the construction of the bridge circuit, the theoretical balance condition has already been discussed in equation 2 page 5. the resistors chosen for the bridge are both 1000Ω. This balance condition is only theoretical due to fluctuations in temperature which will occur as the bridge circuit is in operation. Any increase in temperature will affect the resistance of the bridge. In order to test the designed amplifier circuit, it is connected to the oscilloscope to analyse the output signal. The signal reveals a large amount of noise at low frequencies, which affects the accuracy of the reading. To remedy this, a low pass filter is constructed as detailed in the method section. This has the effect of reducing the noise to a more tolerable level. As each washer is added to the cantilever rig, the resulting output voltage is measured. The output voltage is observed to fluctuate as each washer is added, due to the beam oscillating. The cantilever is allowed a few moments to come to rest before the voltage reading is taken. The following table shows the results: <table/><heading>Analysis of Results</heading>With the numerical data obtained in the previous section, an analysis can be made to assess the linear range and sensitivity of the system. In order to do so, the output data is plotted vs. the loading force. This is shown graphically below: <figure/>From the linear fitting of the data in graph.1, the data is shown to follow an approximate straight line. From this linear fit, the following deductions can be made: Using equation 7 page 8, the sensitivity of this system can be determined, as:  FORMULA  This figure signifies that a change in load of 1N, results in an output fluctuation of 12.5V. The linear trend shown provides an overall equation for output voltage against loading force, and is given by:  FORMULA  ~Eqn. 8 Where x = the load applied in Newton's The accuracy of this equation is best demonstrated by comparing the obtained values with the actual values: <table/>Table 3 confirms that equation 8 above is a reliable model for the output voltage and by taking into account the sources of error in the method, the overall uncertainty in equation 8 is approximately, +/- 0.03V Since the output from the force measurement system is analogue, by digitising the signal, further analyses can be made. This is achieved by connecting the output from the amplifier to a 12-bit A/D converter (6023E). The digital signal is then displayed using the LabView computer program. The program is setup to analyse the signal at a sample rate of 1000/s, with 1000 samples taken. The following graphs demonstrate the affect of the capacitor in reducing the noise in the signal: <figure/><figure/>Evidently by comparison of graph 3, and  graph 2, the low pass filter has the effect of dramatically reducing the amount of noise, and therefore improves the reliability of the instrument. An analysis of the dynamic behaviour is analysed using LabView, by tapping the end of the cantilever prior to sampling, and determining the time taken for it to stabilise. The following figures show this graphically: <figure/>After the initial disturbance, graph 4 shows the number of oscillations occurring before the system stabilises. From this graph it is evident that approximately 20 oscillations occur every second, signifying that the system has a resonant frequency of 20Hz. <heading>Discussion</heading>The results obtained illustrate that the force measurement system which has been designed, offers an approximate linear trend in the output voltage, in response to a load. The resulting output voltage has been shown to follow an approximate linear trend, given by equation 8 page 14. Although the results are satisfactory, there could be improvements made to the method in order to reduce the uncertainty. The ambient temperature for example has not been considered in this report, but may affect the accuracy of the results. The thermal expansion of a material follows the equation:  FORMULA  ~Eqn. 9 <list><heading>Where </heading> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list>Therefore, if it is assumed that Lo = the length calculated in figure 3 page 6, then for each degree change in temperature, the length of the cantilever is expected to increase by only 1.628x10 -6m. Considering this very small increase in length, it is believed that the resultant effect on the strain produced and the maximum loading force will be negligible. In order to design the bridge circuit, a theoretical balance condition is used to determine the resistances in the bridge. However, these resistances are expected to change as the temperature of the system rises. An effort could be made to turn the circuit on for only a short period of time to reduce the heating effect, and therefore improve accuracy. The amount of noise in the signal also has an affect on the accuracy of the data, but the inclusion of a low pass filter, in the amplifier circuit is sufficient to reduce the noise to a tolerable level. A big factor in the errors calculated occurs from the measurements made of the geometrical dimensions of the cantilever. Since only a standard rule was used, the precision of the method was very poor. If a set of Vernier Callipers had been used, and perhaps a Micrometer for the thickness measurement, the error in dimension measurement could be reduced, which would have an effect on the overall accuracy of the force sensor. The sensitivity of the system could be improved even further by increasing the number of gauges. For instance, if 2 gauges had been used for each side of the cantilever, then all four resistances in the bridge would be replaced, and this would have the effect of increasing the sensitivity by a factor of two. This arrangement also compensates any variation caused by temperature, axial and Torsional components. The sensitivity of the system is dependant primarily on the sensitivity of the actual gauges. By changing the material of the strain gauges, for example to Platinum-Tungsten, the gauge factor would be increased from 2.1-4.0. However, despite the improvement in sensitivity, the relative cost of a platinum gauge would be far too excessive for this type of instrument. The resolution is also responsible for reliability in the results. The bit-rate of the A/D converter limits the resolution of the device, and so by increasing the bit-rate the resolution could be improved, so a smaller change in the input can be registered by the program. <heading>Conclusions</heading>The results obtained illustrate that the force measurement system which has been designed, offers an approximate linear trend in the output voltage to the input load, and is given by the equation:  FORMULA  The sensitivity of the system is calculated to be 12.5V/N, signifying that a change in load of 1 Newton will result in an output voltage fluctuation of 12.5 volts. The force measurement system is found to have a resonant frequency of approximately 20Hz. There are many factors which are affecting the uncertainty in the results obtained, such as noise, temperature fluctuation, and gauge sensitivity. The effects of fluctuations in ambient temperature are shown to be negligible in their affect on the force measurement, due to the only small temperature change which is expected. It is believed that the strain gauge material could be upgraded to improve the gauge sensitivity, but the cost of such an improvement would not be economically viable. The number of active gauges in the bridge circuit could also be increased to four, as this arrangement is believed to compensate for any variation caused by temperature, axial and Torsional components. The choice of method used to measure the geometrical dimensions of the cantilever is an enormous factor in the errors, and could easily be reduced by replacing standard rulers for Vernier scales and micrometers.
