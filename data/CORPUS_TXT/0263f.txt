<heading>Project Title</heading>The title of the project is "Comparison of Block and Stream Ciphers". <heading>Problem</heading>Due to the technological developments in telecommunications in recent years, the need for new methods of maintaining security and privacy over insecure communication media has emerged. This is usually achieved through using some form of data encryption. Data encryption involves taking some type of data (in computer communications, generally in binary form) and in some way altering it so that only the intended recipient - and possibly also the sender - can work out what the original data was. The alteration generally involves either rearranging the characters in the data, or replacing certain characters with other characters, or may involve a combination of both of these. Encryption algorithms can be split into two general categories: block ciphers (which encrypt multiple characters at a time) and steam ciphers (which encrypt data character by character). There are many different algorithms within these categories, and often even different ways of implementing the basic algorithms, which leads to a huge array of choices for any given application. <heading>Objectives</heading><list>To gain a good understanding of the theory behind block ciphers.To gain a good understanding of the theory behind stream ciphers.To select two algorithms from each category and examine them in detail.To implement versions of these algorithms in software.To compare the implementations in terms of speed of use.To compare the chosen algorithms in terms of speed of use and resistance to attack.</list><heading>Achievement of Objectives</heading><heading>Objective 1</heading>This objective was very important as completing it thoroughly was absolutely essential to fully understanding the rest of the project. Various resources were used to gather plenty of information about block ciphers, which was then analysed and written up in a clear and concise manner, suitable for inclusion in the final report. The written results from this stage will not only provide valuable background information for the reader of the final report but will also serve as a good reminder of the basics as the project progresses. A good definition of a block cipher was quickly found and an understanding of the principles behind block ciphers was developed through reading appropriate sources. Some very basic specific implementations (e.g. Caesar ciphers) were investigated at this stage where it was beneficial to examine examples to gain a better understanding of the ideas. No candidate algorithms for the project were investigated until a later stage. <heading>Objective 2</heading>As with objective 1, this objective was very important for providing the grounding required to fully understand the rest of the project. Various resources were investigated and plenty of information gathered about stream ciphers, which was subsequently analysed and written up in a format suitable for inclusion in the final report. Again, the written results from this stage will not only provide valuable background information for the reader of the final report but will also serve as a good reminder of the basics as the project progresses. A clear definition and understanding of the principles behind stream ciphers were found through reading and basic specific implementations were investigated as appropriate, though as with objective 1, no candidate algorithms for the project were investigated at this stage. <heading>Objective 3</heading>At this stage, it was necessary to investigate specific block and stream cipher algorithms. A wide variety of algorithms were examined - though it was noted there was a much wider choice of block ciphers than stream ciphers - and two from each category were selected. It was decided that it would be most useful to select algorithms which are in common use, as opposed to selecting ones which appeared perhaps more mathematically interesting and secure but were virtually unheard of. The algorithms chosen are as follows: Block cipher 1: DES Used to be used by the US government for sensitive but unclassified data. Now no longer officially sanctioned by the government but still widely used in industry, for example, in spite of many proposed alternatives being available. Selected due to its wide-spread use in spite of the fact that it is no longer endorsed by the US government. Block cipher 2: IDEA An algorithm originally proposed as a replacement for DES. Selected as it appears to be very secure but has not been well taken up; it would be interesting to see why this may be the case. Stream cipher 1: RC4 Very widely-used software stream cipher, used in applications such as SSL and WEP. Can produce very insecure systems though some are sufficiently secure as to be practically useful. Selected due to its wide use in spite of apparent insecurities. Stream cipher 2: A5 Used in GSM networks for encrypted services but several weaknesses have been identified. Selected as GSM is now the most common way of delivering mobile phone services; would be interesting to see why it is still used in spite of obvious short-comings. These algorithms were investigated in detail to gain a good understanding of their operation and design. The designs of all 4 algorithms are freely available and the information available should be easily sufficient to allow their implementation and comparison in future phases of the project. <heading>Objective 4</heading>Not yet achieved - to be commenced during Christmas break and completed in term 2. <heading>Objective 5</heading>Not yet achieved - to be completed in term 2. <heading>Objective 6</heading>Not yet achieved - to be completed in term 2. <heading>Project Management</heading>No major difficulties have been encountered to date. All targets have been met and the project appears to be proceeding well. It is not envisaged at this stage that any changes to the original list of objectives will be necessary, and it seems likely that all of the original objectives will be achieved within the timescale available. The initial timetable proposed appears to have been very accurate to date with all objectives being completed on target. Having written up - and redrafted as appropriate - a large amount of the research as it was done is likely to free up an appreciable amount of time towards the end of the project as a considerable amount of the final write-up will already have been drafted to a very high standard. This will hopefully mean that fewer redrafts are necessary, and will certainly be an excellent starting point for the report. It is recognised, however, that just because no problems have occurred to date does not mean that none will arise in the future. The main areas which have been identified as potentially problematic are the implementation and comparison phases, which will occur mainly in term 2. It is not envisaged that any specification changes would be necessary, but it is possible (as the author has little previous experience in these areas) that the time required has been underestimated and therefore that these phases may take longer than anticipated. As has previously been mentioned, however, there is some time which was originally to be spent writing up the project which has now been freed up, allowing scope for small timetable adjustments to be made without causing disruption to the project. Assuming that the timetable for the holidays and term 2 is reasonably accurate and that no adjustments are required, the time which has been freed up by writing up research as it is done may be able to be used to develop the project further. One possible area which may be interesting to investigate further would be exactly why the encryption algorithms selected for investigation were chosen for the applications they are used in - for example, why A5 is used in GSM networks. An alternative could be to choose some other property (apart from speed and resistance to attack) to compare the algorithms with. <heading>Updated Timetable</heading><heading>Term 1</heading>Date Task(s) To Be Completed 07/10/05 Specification drafted; resources found 14/10/05 Specification completed; block ciphers researched and written up 21/10/05 Stream ciphers researched and written up 28/10/05 Specific block ciphers researched and written up 04/11/05 Specific stream ciphers researched and written up 11/11/05 Cryptographic attacks researched and written up 18/11/05 Remaining research completed and written up 25/11/05 Progress report drafted 02/12/05 Progress report completed; investigate C++ development environments and compilers <heading>Term 2</heading>Date Task(s) To Be Completed 06/01/06 Complete familiarisation with C++ development environment 13/01/06 Begin implementation of algorithms in C++ 20/01/06 Complete implementation of algorithms in C++ 27/01/06 Test implementations for speed of use 03/02/06 Begin speed of use & ease of attack analysis 10/02/06 Complete speed of use & ease of attack analysis 17/02/06 Begin producing presentation; draft report of work from term 2 24/02/06 Finish producing presentation; complete draft report and discuss with supervisor 03/03/06 Give presentation (if appropriate); make necessary alterations to report 10/03/06 Give presentation (if appropriate); finalise report <heading>Holiday Periods</heading>Over the Christmas vacation, some refamiliarisation with the C++ programming language will be done, as well as selection of an appropriate development environment and compiler.
