<abstract><heading>SUMMARY</heading>The major objectives of this laboratory were: <list>To give an appreciation that there are many factors to be considered when using a manufacturing process to convert raw material into a useful product.To understand that if any of the process variables are changed, the properties of the final product will also be changed.To appreciate that there can be differences between laboratory scale processes and industrial scale processes.</list>The product to be manufactured was an oilite bush. Six bearings were to be made, with two groups of students making three each. The amount of powder (iron and zinc stearate) required for the bearings was weighed according to the specifications given in the laboratory handout. The powder required for one bearing was put into the die and pressed by the hydraulic press. It was then removed from the die using the hand press and the dimensions were recorded. The same process was used to make six bearings by two groups of students. These were then kept in the furnace for sintering for 20 minutes. The dimensions were noted again and the bearings were then applied with axial loads till failure. The load at which the bearings failed was noted. Using the recorded data, Table 1 and Table 2 were completed by calculating the density (before and after sintering), R, ln [1 / (1-R)], porosity (after sintering) and the density change (after sintering). The apparent density was calculated for each bearing. A graph was plotted for ln [1 / (1-R)] against the compaction pressure. The graph line is not straight, but its trend line can be used to calculate the pressure at which g = i. It was observed that the laboratory process of measuring the powder by weight was unsuitable for an industrial manufacture. It was concluded that measuring by volume was a better alternative for the method used. Also, it was evident that a change in one variable during the process modified the end product, yet a change in a second variable could compensate for the change in the first. A full set of variables was provided at the end, to make the bearings to the specifications listed in the handout. </abstract><heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>Manufacturing a product requires a blend of different raw materials that are processed by a combination of methods and techniques. The end product may have varying physical and chemical properties as opposed to those characteristics that are possessed by the raw materials at the beginning of the production. These changes take place because of the different types of processes that the raw materials undergo, and greatly depend on any modification brought about to the variables involved in the processes. The purpose of this laboratory was to recognize and note that forming a product comprises of many changes that are brought about in the raw materials and any modifications in the process variables alter the end product. The product to be made was an iron self-lubricating bearing called an oilite bush. A bush a is a low friction material, which has a precisely controlled inner diameter, outer diameter, and thickness. It is designed to fit into a hole, usually with a loose fit. The amount of iron powder and lubricant, Zinc Stearate, were measured for six bearings according to the specifications listed in the laboratory handout (attached). The quantity of powder enough for one bearing was set into the die and was compressed by a hydraulic press. The bearing was extracted by the hand press and its dimensions were noted. Similarly, three bearings were pressed out by two groups each, and were kept in the furnace for sintering. Then their dimensions were measured again and an axial load was applied to each bearing till they broke due to the pressure. This maximum load was noted. After calculations using the recorded data (Refer Tables 1, 2 and 3), a graph was plotted for ln [1 / (1-R)] against the compaction pressure (in MPa) (Refer Graph A). It was observed that the graph could be used to calculate the pressure at which g = i. The apparent density was calculated for all the bearings. <heading>THEORY</heading><heading>Die Set</heading>A die set is a mould that holds the powder to form a bearing by press fit. It has fixed dimensions, as given in the laboratory handout (Die-Set assembly). The diagram in the handout illustrates the working of a die. <heading>Powder Compactionb</heading>Axial powder compaction is a metal powder processing which fine metal particles are pressed into a desired shape in a metal die under high pressure. The "green" compact is then sintered in a furnace with a protective atmosphere to bond the powdered metal particles together metallurgically. <list><heading>Process Characteristics</heading>Compacts powdered metal in a die Parts are sintered to increase strength through metallurgical bonding Finished parts have a smooth finish and close tolerance Produces very little scrap material Can use alloy combinations and fillers</list>The theory of powder compaction is explained in the diagram below: <picture/><heading>Sinteringc d e </heading>Sintering is a simple process whereby a particular mineral or set of minerals in powder form are heated to a high temperature less than the melting point, where the particles bond to each other, producing a porous material. The material usually shrinks significantly, and often the sintering process occurs in a die with a compaction pressure. The vacuum in space generally helps this process. The heat can come from either direct solar energy and/or microwave. Microwave heating allows quicker uniform heating. The result is a fairly low density material which can be cut and shaped fairly easily, can hold small loads in compression, and provides good thermal insulation, but cannot take much stress in tension and is brittle. Sintering allows production of parts without melting and liquid casting processes, i.e., dealing with only powder or fine sand. The type of furnace most generally favoured is an electrically heated one through which the compacts are passed on a woven wire mesh belt. The belt and the heating elements are of a modified 80/20-nickel/chromium alloy and give a useful life at temperatures up to 1150Â°C. A tube furnace usually has gases that consist of 95% nitrogen and 5% hydrogen. The tensile strength E n of sintered iron powders is insensitive to sintering time, alloying, or particle size in the original powder, but is dependent upon the density (D) of the final product according to FORMULA  where E is Young's modulus and d is the maximum density of iron. <heading>APPARATUS AND METHODS</heading><heading>Apparatus:</heading><list>Die-set (No. 1)5Iron PowderBeakerPlastic BoatCeramic BoatSpatulaDial Gauge Vernier CalliperFace masks, glasses and protective gloves for protectionElectronic balance, hydraulic press, hand press, furnace</list><heading>Method:</heading><heading>Powder Preparation</heading>The product design specification was given in the laboratory handout (attached). Accordingly, the correct amount of iron powder and lubricant, Zinc Stearate, was measured out to make six bearings, taking into account that the lubricant had an insignificant effect on the dimensions of the end product and that no raw material was wasted during the production. <heading>Powder Compaction</heading>The lower half of the die was assembled for the powder compaction. The quantity of powder required for one test bearing was measured and settled into the cavity of the die. The upper punch was pressed down strongly and the length of the uncompressed powder, L p, was taken using the handout given (attached). Following this, the die was hydraulically pressed using a load of 0.5 tons. The 'green' compact was then extracted out of the die using the hand press and its mass and length were measured and recorded (Refer Table 1). The bearing was squeezed slightly and it was noted that the bearing broke into dust when slight pressure applied to it. The above powder compaction was then performed to produce the six bearings (three bearings by each group) but by using different loads (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5 tons). The six bearings were then placed on the ceramic boat in ascending order of the magnitude of the load applied on them. <heading>Sintering Stage</heading>The six bearings on the ceramic boat were kept in the furnace for 20 minutes for sintering. <heading>Measuring and Testing</heading>After the sintering stage was completed and the bearings had cooled down, the mass, length, internal and external diameters for each of the six bearings were measured and recorded (Refer Table 2). Each bearing was then subjected to an increasing axial load until failure. The load at which the failure took place was recorded (Refer Table 3). Following this, Table 1 and Table 2 were completed by calculating the density (before and after sintering), R, ln [1 / (1-R)], porosity (after sintering) and the density change (after sintering). A graph was plotted for ln [1 / (1-R)] against the compaction pressure (Refer Graph A). The apparent density is also calculated (Table 1). <heading>OBSERVATIONS AND CALCULATIONS</heading><heading>Powder Preparation:</heading>Calculation of mass of iron powder and Zinc Stearate required for bearings: Volume of bearing = FORMULA  where R = external radius, r = internal radius, l = length of bearing =  FORMULA  = 541.92 mm 3 Removing porosity = FORMULA  = 406.44 mm 3 Mass of iron powder for each bearing = Density * Volume = (7.8 * 10 -3) * 406.44 = 3.17 g Mass of Zinc Stearate for each bearing (2% of weight) = 0.06 g For six bearings: iron = 19.02 g, ZnSt = 0.36 g <heading>Powder Compaction</heading>Length of uncompressed Powder for all bearings (L p): 28.275 mm <table/><heading>Measurements after sintering stage</heading><table/>After the bearings cooled down, it was observed that those that had been subjected to heavier loads appeared shinier on the surface. <table/><heading>DISCUSSION OF RESULTS</heading>At the end of the laboratory, a graph was plotted for ln [1 / (1-R)] against the compaction pressure (in MPa) (Refer Graph A). It is observed that the graph line is not straight, but the trend line can be used to calculate the pressure at which g = i. This is the density of iron that is listed in the design specification. Using the length of the uncompressed powder measured at the beginning of the powder compaction stage, the apparent density of the powder in the die cavity, p, was determined (Table 2). This density is affected by factors such as a change in the amount of powder that is put into the die, the manual pressure that is applied to it, and the measurements of the external and bore radius of the die. The apparent density is so called because at the stage when the length L p was measured, the powder had only undergone manual compression, and not the load of the hydraulic press. It is observed that p was less than half of g. Hence, p was not the final density of the bearing. The laboratory process seemed to be suitable for small-scale processing of bearings, but inappropriate for any large-scale manufacturing. This is because the laboratory process involved the measurement of the powder by weight, which was time consuming and hence, cannot be used on an industrial level. A better method to fill the die would be the measurement of the powder required for the bearings by volume. This will consume less time and will be more economical for a process that would manufacture millions of small oilite bushes. The laboratory highlights that fact that changing one variable during the process of manufacture alters the end product, but a change in another variable can prevent the alteration of the product. For example, an increase in the mass of the powder will change the density of the bearing, but the length can also be decreased to keep the density constant. Referring to Table 3, it can be observed that not all the bearings have final measurements that fall under the product design specification listed in the laboratory handout. Hence, the values that are highlighted in bold are those that are the correct final values. The bearing that was loaded with a compaction pressure of 2.0 Tons from our final product seems to be most suitable for the manufacture of required bearing. Its specifications are: This is the most ideal bearing, though there may be a bearing more suitable to the specification from those that had been sintered for 10 and 30 minutes. These cannot be compared with in this laboratory due to the lack of data available. <heading>CONCLUSION</heading>The aim of the experiment was to appreciate various factors concerned with manufacturing a bearing. It analysed the fact that a manufacturing process involves many factors that need to be considered when raw material is converted into a useful product. Also, if any process variables are changed, the properties of the final product may change, but changing another variable in the process can compensate for this. Also, the laboratory highlights that there are many differences between the processes used in small scale processing as compared to large scale industrial manufacturing.
