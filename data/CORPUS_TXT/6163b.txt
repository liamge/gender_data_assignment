<heading>PART A: </heading><heading>1) </heading>See diagrams P5.1 and P5.2 <heading>2) </heading><heading>Surface analysis: </heading>A developed low pressure centre can be seen at 60 oN, 10 oW. The start of a developing low pressure system is also found at 53 oN, 7 oW, which can be seen by the 'kink' in the trailing cold front at this point. <heading>500 hPa analysis: </heading>A trough can be seen centred at 60 oN, 15 oW. The geopotential height contours are closer together to the south of the trough, which corresponds to a jet stream: <heading>Comparison</heading>The upper level trough lies slightly to the east of the surface low. This is to be expected as the low is nearly developed, so the upper levels and surface should line up vertically. However, the upper trough lies to the north west of the developing surface low. This, combined with the baroclinic instability at the surface at that point (i.e. the kink in the trailing cold front), suggests that the low is going to develop. In the vicinity of the southern entrance to a jet stream, there is upper level divergence and lower level convergence. This results in a rising air mass, which encourages cyclone development. However, the jet stream would need to be further north for this to be an important factor at 0000UTC (the method may have become more important later in the cyclone's development however). <heading>3) </heading>Please see calculation 1 for full workings. The geostrophic wind was found to be 33 4 ms -1 blowing from the south west and parallel to the isobars at that point. The surface wind was measured to be 65 kts ( 33 ms -1) blowing from the same direction. This result is expected as the wind is calculated at the 500hPa level, so it's well above the boundary layer. Therefore there would be no friction which could cause ageostrophic winds. However, an ageostrophic wind component is normally found in the vicinity of a jet exit region. This is because air parcels decelerate in jet exit regions, so they aren't in geostrophic balance. This leads to ageostrophic motion in jet exit regions towards the area of higher pressure. The reason this isn't observed in the calculated/measured wind may be because the station is situated too far from the exit of the jet to be noticeable (or I've drawn my contours wrongly!) <heading>PART B:</heading><heading>1) </heading>Please see diagram P5.3 <heading>2) </heading>Please see diagram P5.4. How the configuration has change from 00:00UTC: The system has been accelerated along the jet stream and has moved towards the North East (so that the surface low is now positioned ~ 55 oN, 5 oE at 12:00UTC). The jet stream is now positioned directly behind the cold front. This is expected as air is being pulled down from the top of the troposphere at this point and has more momentum, therefore faster winds would be expected (jet streaks). Also, we know from the synoptic chart analysis that the strongest winds blow across the cold front. The upper level trough has also moved slightly towards the south east ~at 57 oN, 2 oW). The cyclone has also developed, as can be seen by the occluded front curling around the surface low. <heading>3) </heading>I believe the system is still developing as the upper level trough is still situated to the north west of the surface low. However, the upper levels and surface are much more lined up (i.e. the upper trough is much less further west than the surface feature). This suggests that the system is becoming fully developed/mature. Also, the geopotential height contours are still crossing the pressure contours (so cyclogenesis). This is more relevant to the initial stages of a developing cyclone however. The cyclone is also now situated near the northern exit of the jet stream; therefore it may be developing through the process discussed in question A2. It's more likely however that this process happened slightly earlier in the cyclone development (i.e. about 06:00UTC when the explosive low developed). Therefore, I believe the system is still developing but is about to reach maturity. <heading>4) </heading>Please see diagram P5.5
