<heading>Referral information Source of referral and a summary of key information</heading>Miss  is a 23-year old receptionist who was electively admitted on  with chronic pelvic pain. <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, and current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background. The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading>Miss  has complained of recurrent pain predominantly in the left iliac fossa, and also suprapubic area for the past seven years, which has progressively been getting worse for the last 3-4 years. She describes the pain as "sharp", grades it as 10/10 at its worst, and currently suffers the same pattern of pain on a daily basis. The pain is aggravated by lying flat, and relieved by trunk flexion. She takes no medication for the pain, it does not radiate, there are no associated factors, and it is not linked with her menstrual cycle. Her cycle is currently regular with 5/5 days bleeding every 30 days. There was no intermenstrual or post-coital bleeding, and no discharge. Her cervical smears have been normal since she started on the screening programme aged 20. Miss  was admitted with the same complaint in 1997, and in 2000 had a diagnostic laparoscopy. Miss  had a bout of oligomenorrhoea in 1996 that resolved spontaneously. She currently complains of a two-year history of dysparenuria on deep penetration. Miss  has had no previous pregnancies, miscarriages or abortions. She has had six previous sexual partners, and has had a stable partner for the last seven years. She does not use contraception. Her past medical history is unremarkable excepting removal of a naevus from her groin aged 11, and grommets in her ears aged 4. She takes no medications, and has no known allergies. Socially, Miss  works as a receptionist, and lives with her fiancée. She smokes 10 cigarettes/day, and takes on significant alcohol. A systems review was unremarkable. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading><heading>General - </heading><list>HR- 68, regular.

The most likely diagnoses at this stage are Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), endometriosis, Pelvic pain syndrome (chronic pelvic pain + dysparenuria without organic cause). Less likely is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and other causes of pelvic masses. This may also be an atypical presentation of sub-acute appendicitis. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>Miss  is a 23-year old lady who has been suffering from chronic, daily pelvic pain for the past 7 years. This affects her performing her daily activities, has caused her to have irregular periods, causes her pain during sexual intercourse, and has caused her worry about her fertility as she has had unprotected regular sex with the same partner for the last 7 years. Socially it has affected her as she describes being embarrassed as she suddenly "doubles up" in pain without warning. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management.

Multiple filmy adhesions within the omentum and sigmoid were evident, attaching mainly to the fundus of the uterus, and serosa of the fallopian tubes. Further inspection revealed tethering of the ovaries to the back of the broad ligaments. A dye salpingogram revealed a non-patent left fallopian tube, and a right fallopian tube, which filled and eventually spilled. Impression- evidence of previous pelvic infection, and blocked left fallopian tube giving an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, and decreased chance of conceiving." </quote>A high vaginal was positive for Staphylococcus aureus , and + for erythrocytes. <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading>Miss  was counselled regarding the risks of general anaesthesia, and consented for a laparoscopy, laparotomy and left salpingoophrectomy. A discussion regarding future family plans also took place, and the risks and potential benefits of removal of an ovary and fallopian tube were discussed. The possibility of IVF at a later stage was also considered and explained. <heading>Prescription/medical intervention</heading>Miss  underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy and subsequent laparotomy and left salpingoophrectomy. Post-operatively, she was prescribed IV Metronidazole (1g/8hrs) and Cefuroxime (1.5g/8hrs). She was also prescribed Co-codamol 8/500 prn. <heading>Observation </heading>Post-operatively, Miss  was observed on the ward for 3 days and discharged with a 6/52 Outpatient appointment. <heading>Referral and team working</heading>Involved Miss 's GP, theatre staff, and the Obstetricians and Gynaecologists at Miss  Hospital. <heading>Advice and Prevention</heading>Excepting abstention, barrier methods of contraception are the best way to prevent chlamydial infection. The progesterone-only pill is also thought to be slightly protective due to the mucus plug formation. <heading>Outcome A description of the progress of the patient as far as possible. This should include consideration of further issues to be resolved. Where appropriate you should contact by telephone patients who have been discharged home.</heading>Mrs  underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy, which showed multiple adhesions from the fundus of the uterus to the peritoneum. The left ovary was covered with multiple adhesions to surrounding structures, and the right ovary also displayed adhesions to the back of the broad ligament. The right fallopian tube looked unhealthy, and the right ovary had a clubbed appearance. The adhesions were divided, and a left salpingoophrectomy was performed. <heading>Evidence based medicine (EBM) and issues for research A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s)</heading>'Clinical Evidence' has provided EBM on 'empirical vs. delayed treatment until the results of microbiological investigations are known' and 'how do different antimicrobial regimes compare?' <heading>1) August 2003- Empirical antibiotic treatment</heading>No Randomised Controlled Trials comparing empirical antibiotic treatment versus treatment guided by test results [1]. However, one case control study found that delaying treatment is associated with reduced fertility [2]. <heading>2) August 2003- Different antimicrobial regimes</heading>There is consensus that antibiotic treatments are more effective than no treatment for women with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). One systematic review of observational studies and RCTs has found that several different antibiotic regimens (including parenteral clindamycin plus parenteral aminoglycoside; parenteral cephalosporin with or without probenecid plus oral doxycycline; and oral ofloxacin) are similarly effective in relieving the symptoms of PID, and achieve high rates of clinical and microbiological cure. We found no good evidence on the optimal duration of treatment. Two RCTs found no significant difference between oral ofloxacin versus parenteral cefoxitin and doxycycline. One RCT found no significant difference between outpatient treatment with intramuscular cefoxitin - probenecid and oral doxycycline versus parenteral antibiotics for outcomes of recurrence, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy at 35 months [3]. In the studies reviewed, cure rates of between 88-100% were achieved [4,5]. It is interesting to note that there is no EBM explicitly directed towards medical vs. surgical management of PID, and no EBM on methods of restoring tubal function post- PID. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a spectrum of infections of the female genital tract that includes endometritis, salpingitis, tuboovarian abscess, and peritonitis. PID exclusively affects women, and around 1 in 50 sexually active women in the UK develop PID each year. It is most common in women aged between 15 and 24, although sexually active women of any age may contract PID. Depending on the severity of the infection, patients with PID may be minimally symptomatic or may present with toxic symptoms of fever, nausea, vomiting, and severe pain. The commonest reported symptom of PID is uni/bilateral lower abdominal pain. However, vaginal discharge, lower back pain, and irregular vaginal bleeding also commonly occur. One of the commonest signs of PID is lower abdominal tenderness. Pelvic examination may reveal mucopurulent cervical discharge, cervical excitation, uterine tenderness, and/or bilateral adnexal tenderness. An adnexal mass may be found in more extensive cases, suggesting a tuboovarian abscess, or peritonitis may be present, mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. PID is a worldwide phenomenon, but the commonest causative agent(s) vary with location. In the West the commonest infective agents is Chlamydia trachomatis followed by  Neisseria gonorrhoeae, although many Gram-negative organisms (e.g. E. coli) and Gram-positive organisms (e.g. Streptococci Groups B and D) are also causative agents. Anaerobes (e.g. Bacteriodes), Mycoplasma hominis, and Actinomyces israelii have also been identified as causative agents in PID, although a sexually transmitted infectious organism is not recovered in a third of women with PID. Certain infectious agents have also been linked with intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs). The pathogenesis of PID is incompletely understood. However, mononuclear cells are one of the hallmarks of chronic inflammation. In chronically or repeatedly infected individuals, increased chlamydial hsp (heat shock protein) expression secondary to the action of gamma interferon produced by the T-helper 1 cell mediated immune response might drive persistent chlamydial infection and chronic inflammation. Chronic infection might in turn lead to the fibrosis and scarring characteristic of the severe sequelae of C. trachomatis infection. On Laparoscopy, adhesions between the ovaries, fallopian tubes peritoneum and other structures may be evident. The adhesions due to C. trachomatis are said to have a characteristic filmy appearance, although this is not pathognomonic of C. trachomatis infection. Management of PID is either medical or surgical. Medical management must first begin with a sensitive; yet frank discussion about sexual health. Risk factors for PID include youth and sexual activity (under 25), multiple sexual partners, and not using barrier methods of contraception. The patient should be asked to bring her partner(s) in for screening to the clinic, and abstain from sexual activity with them until they have also been treated. Doxycycline 100mg bds for 7 days the current recommended outpatient regime. Side effects include possible interference with the pill, and photosensitivity. If there are doubts about compliance, 1g azithromycin may be prescribed immediately. If pregnant or lactating, erythromycin 500mg qds for 7 days may be used, although a test for cure 3 weeks later is recommended, as this method is less effective than Doxycycline. Long-term sequelae of PID include infertility, chronic persistent pain, increased incidence of ectopic pregnancy, increased further risk of PID, and tuboovarian abscess. Surgical management is indicated for chronic pain 2 to adhesions, and tuboovarian abscesses. The most common operation performed is salpingoophrectomy, although this has considerable effects on the woman's fertility. Appropriate counselling should be given regarding assisted conception and future family planning. Up to 30% women become infertile after one episode of PID, 9% have an ectopic pregnancy, and 18% experience chronic pelvic pain. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading>Presentation and differential diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain.
