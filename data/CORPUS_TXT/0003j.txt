Rousseau has always been typified as an intellectual outsider; it was, however, only in the twentieth century that his socio-political theory came to be seen as a threat to the individual's liberty. Emphasis thereby is often laid on his concept of a 'general will', through which personal liberty is handed over to the collective. 'The citizens having but one interest', Rousseau argues, 'the people [have] but a single will'. And although Rousseau favours the ballot vote, he argues for the infallibility of its ruling: 'when the opinion contrary to my own prevails, it proves nothing more than that I made a mistake, and that what I took to be the general will was not'. From the point of view of Rousseau, most importantly protection should be rendered against the emergence of a minority rule, or 'particular will', rather than against the state, which, after all, represents the sovereignty of the lawgiver as it corresponds with the community's best interest, the general will. The question I will look at here is thus to what extent the critical assertion holds truth that 'the more safeguards he established against despotism, the more weapons he forged for tyranny', within Rousseau's system of the social contract. <fnote>Iain Hampsher-Monk, 'Rousseau and totalitarianism: with hindsight?' in Robert Wokler (ed), Rousseau and Liberty (Manchester/New York, 1995), p. 268. </fnote><fnote>Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract and Discourses (London/New York, 1952), p. 87. </fnote><fnote>Christopher Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and The Social Contract (London, 2004), p. 120. </fnote><fnote>Hampsher-Monk, 'Rousseau and totalitarianism: with hindsight?', p. 271. </fnote>Recent criticism has argued that the Cold War split has caused intellectuals to make an over-simplified distinction between 'individualistic liberalism and state collectivism', stating that Rousseau was on the totalitarian side of the argument. Rousseau, however, from the outset entertains an awareness of the problem of new forms of subjugation that hide behind a powerful state, and thus sets out to construct a model for a 'form of association [...] in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain free as before'. In this sense, Rousseau undertakes to find a form in which freedom can be exercised on a public, political level. The important distinction that has to be made here though, is the type of freedom at stake. Arguing that pre-modern, pre-social man exercised an individual sovereignty free from social obligation or commitment, knew a natural, brutal kind of liberty. When people come to regular interaction, they become interdependent, which goes accompanied by fierce passions. It is only within society that morality comes to exist, through virtue and pitié, a form of compassion which counters man's corruption by society. What is then needed is the construction of an association in which passions are tempered and virtue is encouraged. In this sense, envisaging a social contract is merely a theoretical exercise, to find a form in which such an exercise of sovereignty can be best expressed, in other words, 'Rousseau's purpose is to discover a rule which has moral validity'. <fnote>Hampsher-Monk, 'Rousseau and totalitarianism: with hindsight?', p. 268. </fnote><fnote>Rousseau, The Social Contract, p. 12. </fnote><fnote>Patrick Neal, Liberalism and Its Discontents (London, 1997), p. 61. </fnote><fnote>Rousseau, The Social Contract, p. 5. </fnote><fnote>Maurizio Viroli, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the 'well-ordered society' (Cambridge, 1988), p. 132. </fnote><fnote>Christopher Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and The Social Contract (London, 2004), p. 19. </fnote><fnote>Viroli, The 'well-ordered society', p. 121. </fnote>Another point of view insists on the juxtaposition of democracy and liberalism, positioning Rousseau in a radically democratic framework. Certainly, this view depends greatly on the view one takes of liberalism. Liberalism can be taken at an individual level, stressing the removal of any constraint on human action (negative liberty), and placing theory in wider context, that of the body politic (positive liberty). Rousseau is quite explicit about what form of liberty we are to seek. 'Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains', he argues, 'One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they'. It is therefore clear that Rousseau seeks a wider answer to the question of liberty, one for which 'it is necessary to ensure that the conditions in which [people] live do not pose a threat to their survival'. This condition can be brought about by the realisation that it is the best interest of all citizens to care for other's interest and well-being. Here we find the distinction that Rousseau makes between a narrow form of personal interest and a wider, more coherent form of enlightened interest, being the best for the community, and thus, indirectly, each citizen's actual will, as it secures the best-considered proposal and enjoys general support of the citizenry. Subordination to the law subsequently only becomes an exercise of one's liberty. <fnote>Carol Blum, Rousseau and the Republic of Virtue.

This is where Rousseau takes a radically democratic stance, criticising Kant's very open assertion that law can still be legitimate only by the requirement that the requirement 'that the proposal could have been agreed to had the citizens been consulted and were they fully rational'. Hence Rousseau's claim that 'power indeed may be transmitted, but not the will': for the general will to function, it requires the individual standpoints of each citizen. Unanimity is thereby not needed; it is in fact a sign of an unhealthy body politic. The only law that requires unanimity of all citizens is the social pact, since by this each individual hands over their individual sovereignty to the higher expression of the community. Within the body politic, the general will aims to protect rather than to attack its participants, and 'it is not', therefore, 'to be assumed that any of the parties then expects to get hanged'. Likewise, peace with neighbouring communities is required by natural law. It has therefore been claimed that the general will represents a model for the well-being of all, and thus reflects 'each individual's good or real will'. <fnote>Neal, Liberalism, p. 63. </fnote><fnote>Rousseau, The Social Contract, p. 20. </fnote><fnote>Ibid, pp. 87-88. </fnote><fnote>Ibid, p. 28. </fnote><fnote>Hampsher-Monk, 'Rousseau and totalitarianism: with hindsight?', p. 270. </fnote><fnote>Ibid, p. 270. </fnote>The emphasis that Rousseau lays on the collective, however, is today regarded with mistrust. After all, the functioning of the general will depends entirely upon the full dedication of the citizenry to the social contract, and we find 'no restriction of principle on what it may command in that form'. It appears at times as though Rousseau puts all individual risks at right for an ideologically unified community. As soon as all sovereignty passes from the individual to the state, a greater power comes to exist which '[man] cannot use without the help of others'. Contrarily, there is no 'safeguards for the individual against the state'. The Rousseauean state results in collective socialisation, only rendered legitimate through the consent of its participants. In a wider interpretation of the social contract as merely a thought experiment, this socialisation obtains a somewhat enforced character.  <fnote>Bertram, Rousseau and The Social Contract, p. 193. </fnote><fnote>Blum, Republic of Virtue, p. 111. </fnote><fnote>Hampsher-Monk, 'Rousseau and totalitarianism: with hindsight?', p. 272. </fnote><fnote>Ibid, p. 268. </fnote>One form of criticism of the general will draws parallels with the Jacobin rule during the French revolution. Both reveal traces of absolutist totalitarianism: 'It is absolutely necessary that evil come from others and from them alone'. Despite the validity of a critique of Rousseau's reassertion that the general will is infallible (which indeed shows traces of a majority intolerance), it is difficult if not altogether impossible to find examples of the Rousseauean state in practice. Eastern block socialism, which has been suggested as imposing some for of a state-directed will upon its citizens, has been severely criticised. Also the Jacobin adoption of Rousseau's general will has been seen as of symbolic value rather than a precise influence of his thought. Lacking everywhere has been the binding together of lawgiver and subject, which according to Rousseau results only in the imposition a particular will of a state governed by a political elite.  <fnote>Jean Starobinski, 'La Mise en accusation de la Société', cited in Carol Blum, Rousseau and the Republic of Virtue.

It is therefore perhaps surprising that Rousseau leans entirely on the exercise of a general will in ensuring the best for all citizens. Through this construct, Rousseau categorically denies the individual any sovereignty except for a participatory role in the community. Effectively, the state attains a strongly fortified position in which ' [t]he more the natural strengths are dead and destroyed, the more the acquired ones are great and durable, and the more solid and perfect this institution is'. Such a radical step toward an active, creative form of liberalism challenges liberals into the debate of the equalisation of the citizenry, since 'serious economic inequalities destroy liberty'. Nonetheless, it does not suffice to, as a consequence of this conclusion, leave all individual property and grounds for action within the confines of the community's sovereignty. <fnote>Viroli, The 'well-ordered society', p. 113. </fnote><fnote>Blum, Republic of Virtue, p. 111. </fnote><fnote>Hampsher-Monk, 'Rousseau and totalitarianism: with hindsight?', p. 275. </fnote>One of Rousseau's ideas of human nature was that the strongest of human passions was amour the soi (love of self), of which virtue and piti éwere manifestations within society. 'No-one has any interest in making them [the conditions of association] burdensome to others' This may be seen as a problem for the protection of the individual's rights: Rousseau does not expect the intrusion of state into the individual's life and thus includes no precautions to safeguard certain domains of private life. 'If this leads to intervention in 'areas which are perceived as illiberal, such as the social and economic conditions of citizen's lives and with their beliefs and values', this is seen by Rousseau as a decision of the general will in order to secure the necessary conditions for socio-political liberty. To some extent the modern welfare state can be seen as a moderate outcome of Rousseau's general will, be it on a representative basis. Executive and lawmaking government of the welfare state is now generally expected to create policy that benefits the community in a broad social sense. Taxation, health security and economic intervention are put in place to equalise conditions and ensure a minimum standard of welfare for each citizen, whereas participation in elections for government positions is open to each citizen. This form of moderate liberal welfare state, however, fails to pass the test, since in this model the law does not come from all. <fnote>Bertram, Rousseau and The Social Contract, p. 24. </fnote><fnote>Hampsher-Monk, 'Rousseau and totalitarianism: with hindsight?', p. 281. </fnote><fnote>Ibid, p, 275. </fnote><fnote>Bertram, Rousseau and The Social Contract, p. 157. </fnote>The dichotomy between modern, individualist liberalism and the Rousseauean state lies predominantly in their different interpretations of liberty. Whereas the former stress the lack of protection for the individual in Rousseau's social contract, Rousseau in turn entertains concerns with the crude, unsocial kind of liberty that individualists profess. Rather does he see liberty in a community best exercised at the highest level, thus enhancing liberty in an ordered way. For order to exist, there needs to be unity based on a reasonable principle; the social contract offers just that. As liberty exercised only on the most individual, narrow level only furthers contradiction in interests, Rousseau proposes the pursuit of community interest, which, if carried out fully, secures the welfare and safety of all its citizens. What Rousseau does not display enough attention to, however, was the fact that 'there is never a perfect fit between moral requirements of our rational nature and requirements of citizenship'. This results in a lack of consideration of the nature of the general will, and its proper domain. Rousseau, on the contrary, believes in the stabilising role of the general will, and the inalienability of the will in general. As the general will represent the only genuine method of determining the sovereign will of the citizenry, parallels drawn between totalitarian ideological states and Rousseau's general will are, strictly theoretical, incorrect. The problem, nonetheless, lies with the radical solution Rousseau's general will poses. Asserting that '[t]o be governed by appetite alone is slavery, while obedience to a law one prescribes to oneself is freedom', leaves very little space for individual action. Thus, a community taking its legislative task to the extreme, might indeed force its citizens into abide by the law. The question becomes, then, not to what extent Rousseau can be used for totalitarian ends, which he explicitly sets out to prevent, but rather how a feasible system may be envisaged in which particular interpretations of the general good can obtain a stable construct in which the individual is both more protected and better positioned to criticise the state's pursuit of the general good. <fnote>Viroli, The 'well-ordered society', p. 38. </fnote><fnote>Christopher Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and The Social Contract (London, 2004), p. 33. </fnote><fnote>Rousseau, The Social Contract, p. 20. </fnote><fnote>Neal, Liberalism, p. 60. </fnote><fnote>Christopher Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and The Social Contract (London, 2004), p. 194. </fnote>
