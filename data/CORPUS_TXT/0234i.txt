This report will focus on a cantilever system, in which a Beam-Type Load cells involved and will be looking at how a system made up of strain gauges and Beam- Type Load Cells amplify signals, transmit data to an analogue device and how to digitise data to a digital signal for further processing, displaying and storage. <heading>Theory</heading>Before looking at how to make a system work, it is important to understand how this system is expected to work. Force Beam and strain gauges Wheatstone bridge circuit Amplifiers Data Display Force As the design of the cantilever and selection of strain gauges has already been done, only the beam type instrument is left to be designed. The signal must have to be big enough to be detected. Therefore, amplifier is used in this case. There are 2 types of amplifier, generally and they are inverting and non-inverting amplifier. Inverting amplifier inverts polarity of the output from the input, which is 190 degree out of phase with the output. The amplification produced by a circuit is described by its gain. Noise is added in all kind of real electronic circuits as signals passing through them. It has to be one of the factors that have to be considered <heading>Methods</heading><heading>1a.</heading>Measure the geometrical dimensions of the cantilever and the distance between strain gauges and the support.

A non inverting amplifier is used because it does not invert the output signal Since Gain in an non-inverting amplifier = R1+R2/R2 , providing the gain is between 100 and 1000. Therefore, the resistance of R1 is chosen to be 1MΩ and R2 to be 1kΩ which will give a gain of 1000. <picture/>After connection, a considerable amount of noise in the output due to high gain used has to be filtered out as there is no screen protection. A low pass filter made of a capacitor across a feedback resistor of the amplifier can be used. In this case, frequency lower than 10Hz will be filtered as it is regarded as noise. To find out what capacitor should be used, equation below could be used: Time= RC Substitute T=0.1, calculated by equation F=1/T, where F is the frequency and T is the period, which will give  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  By installing a capacitor of 0.1μF, any frequency lower than 10Hz will hopefully be filtered. <heading>4.</heading>Carry out test and calibration of the design made which includes the ready-made cantilever, strain gauges, bridge circuit and amplifier by adding washers to the nylon screw at the end of the cantilever beam progressively after zeroing the system. <heading>5.</heading>To transform analogue signal to digital signal for further processing or other purposes, analogue data is input to a computer system which has integrated or external analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue functions. Labview can be used to process the data. <heading>Conclusions/Discussion</heading>System designed is to measure low-level force and transmit data as a signal and be displayed. The processing is mainly done by the strain gauges in the circuit. A gauge is put on each side of the cantilever. So when there is a force applied at the end of the cantilever, gauge 1 on the top of the cantilever would experience a tensile strain while gauge 2 on the bottom will be under a compressive strain. The theoretical balance condition of the bridge has been derived early on and we can base on equation(1) to derive an overall equation for output voltage, which takes loading force and deflection into account. Equation 1 gives  FORMULA  As gauge 1 is under a tensile strain, it will change from R 1 to  FORMULA  While gauge 2 is under a compressive strain, it will change from R 2 to  FORMULA  Substituting into (1), will give  FORMULA  As the equation suggests, the deflection becomes one of the factors that have to be considered. It is believed dimensions of the cantilever would affect the range of deflection. Therefore, it is assumed that dimensions of the cantilever would influence the sensitivity of the measurement system. To improve the system, 4 active gauges can be introduced as the sensitivity would be increase dramatically and can compensate any other factors that may influence sensitivity like temperature, axial and torsional components. Also, repeated reading can minimise any human mistakes.
