<abstract>Synchrotron radiation is a truly spectacular form of light, used in many situations as an aid to understanding the weird and wonderful structure and behaviour of molecules, atoms, crystals and innovative new materials. While most devices are only able of generating one type of electromagnetic radiation, synchrotrons have the supreme capability of producing light over a broad range, from the infrared to X-rays. What's more, the intensity of the synchrotron radiation is over a billion times greater than that produced by a typical laboratory X-ray source.1 This paper looks at the development and applications of the revolutionary instrument which has given man unrivalled power and precision in probing the fundamental nature of matter. </abstract>The Daresbury SRS Synchrotron Radiation Source is the world's first dedicated high-energy (2GeV) synchrotron source, exploiting synchrotron radiation for fundamental and applied research, with the first user experiments in 1980. With a main ring of 96 metres in circumference, the SRS encapsulates a varied amalgamation of experimental facilities, which deliver synchrotron radiation with wavelengths extending from the infrared to hard X-rays. Techniques available include X-ray diffraction, X-ray spectroscopy (XAFS), small-angle/wide-angle scattering, soft X-ray spectroscopy, photoemission, and imaging.2  <picture/>So how does it all work? A synchrotron itself is essentially an accelerator in which charged particles are accelerated around a fixed circular path by an electric field and held to the path by an increasing magnetic field. <figure/>As Einstein's Special Relativity states that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum, these charged particles (usually electrons or protons) are accelerated to relativistic speeds, sometimes nearly (99.999%) the speed of light. Now when an electron undergoes a constant acceleration (acceleration happens not only when changing speed, but also when changing direction) it emits electromagnetic radiation (photons), in accordance with Maxwell's equations, and these photons are emitted in a narrow cone in a forward direction, at a tangent to the orbit.3  In a high-energy (of the order of GeV) accelerator the energies of the emitted photons vary from low energy infrared to energetic short wavelength X-rays. This radiation is called Synchrotron Radiation. The radiation is then focused down pipes called beamlines, which are placed at tangents to the ring, and consist of arrays of mirrors, lenses and filters to provide beams of varying wavelength and intensity at the work areas where the scientists run their experiments. Each type of beamline is designed for a specific type of scientific technique. The ability to select different radiation wavelengths and the high intensity allows experiments that would otherwise be unfeasible. In 1997, Dr Paul Hatherly, under the title of Principle Investigator, began a three year project which involved the overseeing of the construction progress of the new Extreme Ultra Violet and X-ray (XUV) beamline on the SRS. Originally, the SRS was designed to use the main dipole magnets as the primary source of radiation, however it has recently been desirable to incorporate so called 'insertion devices'. These devices are magnetic structures, inserted into the straight sections between the bending magnets on the storage ring. A multi-pole wiggler (MPW) is a principle type of insertion device consisting of a linear array of alternating magnetic dipoles, which influences the beam of electrons to 'wiggle' about the nominally straight trajectory and emit radiation.4  <figure/><quote>"The intensity of the synchrotron radiation is over a billion times greater than that produced by conventional X-ray tubes..." </quote>The newly commissioned (2001) beamline, MPW6.1 ("PHOENIX") combines research programmes in surface science and nanotechnology with programmes in atomic and molecular physics. It is based on a 2 Tesla strength multi-pole wiggler insertion device which, due to the increased number of poles in the device, is capable of providing about ten times the photon flux output as compared with traditional bending magnets at Daresbury.5 The photon energy range covered is from 40eV to 350eV, however there is significant flux available to 500eV, meaning that the beamline is highly suitable for experiments aimed at determining the chemistry and the physical and electronic structure of nanoscale materials.6  <figure/>Why, you ask, is synchrotron radiation so important? For a start it is by far the most powerful light produced by humans, emitted in pulses typically picoseconds (10 -12s) or femtoseconds (10 -15s) in length, and only a few thousandths of a millimetre in diameter.7 The light is highly collimated (light rays are aligned parallel to one another) and incredibly bright, millions of times greater than that produced by the Sun, and billions of times greater than that produced by conventional X-ray tubes. You could compare an x-ray beam from a synchrotron with a laser and one from an X-ray tube with a floodlight. Although they both might deliver the same number of photons per second, those from the synchrotron are concentrated in a smaller angle, whereas those from the x-ray tube are widely scattered. This means that there is essentially a higher photon flux on a smaller area. Because of this increase in flux, scientists can perform a wider range of experiments for example, they can simply study much smaller objects or choose a very specific range of photon energies with which to examine samples.8 One very important technique performed at the PHOENIX station is that of Spin Polarised Photoemission, whereby the energy, angle and spin of photo-emitted electrons is established by combining both circularly polarised x-rays and electron spin analysis. It is the most direct means of probing spin-split electronic structures and it is a key technique in the study of magnetic materials. Daresbury Laboratory is home to the only research equipment in the UK designed and built for this purpose.9 However the application of synchrotron radiation experiments occurs in many fields, ranging from materials research to medical research and imaging. It can be used to trace the distribution of pollutants in natural systems, analyse ore samples to establish the value of a possible mining site, and even analyse a hair sample for trace elements to determine whether an Inca leader was poisoned many years ago. The ultra-bright X-rays are being used to help the industry develop solvent-free paints, find new ways to manufacture biodegradable plastics that can be eaten by bugs, and study the surfaces and interfaces between materials; research which can help tackle corrosion problems in cars, planes, and pipelines. <quote>"If proven successful, this technique will allow the eradication of cancer cells without the need for major surgery..."</quote>Additionally, the exploration of diverse materials such as semiconductors, glasses, muscle fibres, and plastics has been taken to a new level, and as a consequence, the development of new injection-moulded materials for example running shoes, car bodies and even furniture foam has been realised in a fraction of the time it would take without the existence of synchrotron radiation.10  In astronomy, synchrotron radiation has been suggested as the mechanism for producing strong celestial radio sources like the Crab Nebula. This Nebula is the remnant of a star that was observed to explode in 1054 A.D. located some 6000 light years away in the constellation Taurus. At the heart of the Crab Nebula lies a rapidly rotating neutron star (or pulsar) that is apparently pumping enormous amounts (equivalent to that given off by 100 Suns) of energy into the nebula in the form of high-energy particles and magnetic fields. Due to the magnetisation of the pulsar, electric voltages in excess of 10 quadrillion (one quadrillion equals 10 15) volts are produced. The gravity of the pulsar, being more than 100 billion times greater than that on Earth, is completely overwhelmed by the immense electric field, and this leads to particles being ripped off the neutron star and accelerated to relativistic speeds. These particles spiral around magnetic field lines, producing synchrotron radiation in the form of X-rays as they do so.11 <picture/><picture/>The Crab Nebula's bell-shaped appearance in the X-ray image (shown in pale blue-purple) is due to synchrotron radiation from a huge magnetised bubble of high-energy electrons that is several light years in diameter. Although this is a natural example of synchrotron radiation production on the cosmic scale, however the fundamentals of the process remain the same. At present, X-ray crystallography, a technique first introduced by William L. Bragg in 1913, is the most important use of X-ray synchrotron radiation. The diffraction patterns produced in X-ray crystallography when firing X-rays through crystals (often proteins) reveal the atomic make-up and molecular structure of the crystal. Investigations using synchrotron X-rays for protein crystallography can help scientists understand and imitate complex structures - from cellulose fibre to spiders' silk.12  It is thanks to X-ray crystallography that James Watson and Francis Crick were able to discover the "double helix" structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA. The big clue came from an X-ray diffraction photo of the B form of purified DNA fibres 13 (shown below). The inner cross pattern consisting of a pair of strong arcs along the vertical axis gave Watson and Crick clues about the double helix structure of DNA. <picture/>An ever-increasing number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as university researchers are utilising synchrotron radiation in their experiments to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins. This knowledge obtained by using synchrotron radiation has allowed protein crystal structures to be determined in a matter of days as opposed to months or even years, and as a result new and more efficient drugs and treatments have been formulated to combat viruses and even disease. In 1985, Dr Michael Rossman and his colleagues determined the structure of a receptor on a human cell that binds to the common cold virus, by using synchrotron radiation and X-ray crystallography.14 This work, and that of other laboratories, may help scientists determine how a cold virus and other viruses enter and infect human cells. Even more recently in 2003, Dr Robert Gallo, who in the early 1980's discovered all we know today about HIV and AIDS, has used the same techniques to formulate a potentially successful HIV vaccine.15 One of the most promising uses of synchrotron radiation however, is applied in the field of cancer research. <picture/>X-ray synchrotron radiation is used to study samples of cancerous tissue for example in the brain, while researchers are investigating the idea of neutron capture for cancer treatments.16 While is has already been proven that high-powered X-rays are an effective killer of cancerous cells, there has also been a considerable difficulty in depositing the maximum energy to the offending cells or tumour, while minimising the dose to the surrounding good tissue. With the current advancement in technology, the idea is that in the near future synchrotron X-radiation beams may be focused accurately enough to attack individual cancer cells. If proven successful, this technique will allow the eradication of cancer cells without the need for major surgery, and eventually make this evil disease a thing of the past.
