<heading>Question 1Why did M&S suffer its downturn in the late 1990s? Distinguish between internal factors (expectations, culture and organisation) and external factors (customers and competitors). </heading>Marks and Spencer were founded through the partnership of Michael Marks and Tom Spencer. Simon Marks took over M&S and the company was hugely successful in terms of profit and market share. Richard Greenbury became the CEO of M&S from 1991 and the company continued to make a success until the late 1990s. <heading>Internal factors</heading><heading>Expectations</heading>---It is about the expectation of shareholders, CEO, managers and staff. Something that they expect the organisation to be what they can get back from the organisation. Cost control through full-time sales assistants reduction led to an inability in stores to meet the service levels. Employees expected stable and rewardful job. Cutting of full-time sales meant employees worked less and earn less which was out of their expectation. Employees expected secure and stable job. To grow through expansion overseas though many of the countries were difficult to expand in and might lead to scarification of cash flow. The appointed CEO, Peter Salsbury, was poorly received by shareholders. Salsbury was not the one shareholders expected as he had only worked in womenswear which was one of worst performing units in M&S. Market share kept falling which made stakeholders lost their interest in M&S. <heading>Culture</heading>---It is about people attitudes and act within the company. Organisational culture is a critical feature of successful organisations: Managers followed central direction on how the stores operated which restricted how they could respond to the local needs of customers. Focus on day-to-day operations rather than long term strategy. Sticked to traditional culture and ignored the changes in the market place. Tied to a generalized view of the market instead of trying to understand and tailor offerings to various market segments. Having an inward culture which almost all managers and executives were promoted internally starting at the bottom. They already immersed in the established culture without innovations and knowledge form outside world. Autocratic approach from Greenbury as he only allowed discussion in the boardroom and persuade people of his views. Inadequate communication between executives, directors and staff as top management sat in offices which were separated from their staff. Employees were happy and felt secure to work with M&S before as the company as t foster good human relations with staff. However, employees felt stress, unsatisfied and unhappy to work in late 1990s because of Greenbury's autocratic approach and cutting of staff. <heading>Organisation</heading>---It is about the structure of the company, including power structure and flow of decision making. Hierarchical structure with CEO, top management, store managers and staff. Top-down management which could often take the form of shouting and bullying which led to dislike of employees. Centralised authority caused lots of problems as store managers and staff were restricted in what they could do Disagreement with directives sent down from the top. Greenbury decided to control cost by having less full-time sales assistants, but store managers brought in all available employees to appeal the stores gave level of service when Greenbury visited the stores. Greenbury never saw customer surveys results but make judgements on how M&S operated by sales figures and visits to stores. This led to lack of understanding of customers' needs. Top management was dominated by men while a large proportion of M&S customers were women. This led to lack of understanding of customers' needs. <heading>External factors</heading><heading>Customers:</heading>Changing taste and preference of customers made M&S products which remained in the stores all year round no longer attractive. Customers were looking for up-to-date fashion but M&S seemed only offered traditional range. Customers were not satisfied with the clothing range of the stores as M&S did not segregate the clothing into different sections for different segments. Customers looked for clear layout of products so that they could find what they needed easily. <heading>Competitors:</heading>Situated in a turbulent competitive environment. Competitors like The Gap, Oasis and Next, which were at the top end of market, offered more design focused with up-to-date fashions but with similar price to M&S. Discount stores like Matalan and 'George' range at Asda at the bottom end of market offered essential and basic clothing, but at much lower price. Tesco and Sainsbury offered added value foods which were pioneered by M&S. Competitors reacted to changes in the market place quickly. <heading>Finance:</heading>Having financial difficulties worldwide because of tough trading conditions. <heading>Question 2Using the culture web as a model, identify some of the more important and influential aspects of the M&S culture. </heading>The concept of culture web is a representation of the paradigm (taken-for-granted assumptions) of an organisation and the physical manifestations of organizational culture. The cultural web provides wider aspects of the organisation as to give clues about the paradigm and to reinforce the assumptions within the paradigm. It can be used as a way of understanding current organizational culture and desired future culture. The cultural web is a useful way of considering the cultural context for change. The elements of the cultural web are rituals and routines, stories, symbols, power structures, organizational structures and control systems. Rituals and routines------Rituals are about organization events through which the organisation emphasizes what is particularly important. Routines are how members of the organisation behave towards each other and towards those outside the organisation. Stories-----------------------Stories and myths told by members of the organisation to each other, to outsiders and to new recruits which embed the present in its organisational history. Symbols---------------------Such as logos, offices, cars and titles or the type of language and terminology commonly used become a shorthand representation of the nature of the organisation. Power structure------------It is about how power distributed in the organisation. The most powerful groupings within the organisation are likely to be closely related to the assumptions and paradigm. Organisational structure------Outline important relationships and emphasise what is important in the organisation. It can reflect the power structure and show how decisions flow. Control systems-----------Measurements and reward systems emphasise what is important to monitor in the organisation and to focus attention and activity upon. <figure/>The assumption which constitute the paradigm reflect the common public perception that M&S is traditional, old-fashioned and lack of innovations as it always emphasis and launch classic style clothing without any fashionable design. Also stories about M&S products were not attractive meant its products were not up-to-fashion and not innovative. M&S products were seen as of high quality as it launched the 'St Michael' logo to prove the quality and always use the same suppliers to ensure quality. All the organizational structure, control systems and board room meeting made M&S being percept as an organisation which emphasis on organisational structure. <heading>Question 3Which 'levers' did M&S use to try to bring about change? </heading>Sometimes there is a tendency towards inertia and resistance to change. People will tend to hold on to existing ways of doing things and existing beliefs about what makes sense. Managing strategic change must therefore address the powerful influence of the paradigm and the cultural web on the strategy being followed by the organisation. If change is to be successful it also has to link the strategic and the operational and everyday aspects of the organisation. Managers need to consider how to balance the different approaches to managing strategic change according to the circumstances they face. Different 'levers' can be employed to manage strategic change. Levers include the importance of changes in structure and control, the need to change organizational routines and symbols and the importance of political processes, communication and other change tactics. Structural and control-----These aspects of change tend to position top managers as controllers of change with organizational members responding to the systems they install. Routines---They are the organizationally specific 'ways we do things around here' which tend to persist over time and guide people's behaviour. Symbolic processes------Changes in everyday things which are nevertheless especially meaningful in the context of a particular situation or organisation. Symbols can be objects, events, acts or people which express more than their intrinsic content. Political processes---------There may be a need for the reconfiguration of power structures in the organisation to build a power base, encourage support or overcome resistance and achieve commitment to a strategy or course of action. Communication------------It is important to communicate with members of the organisation understand the need for change, what it is intended to achieve or what is involved in the changes. Change tatics---------------Including timing, job losses and de-layering and strategies which can be put in place and to be successful quickly. M&S used different levers at different time periods and with different CEOs. Luc Vandevelde was appointed as the new CEO of M&S in January 2000. Between January to May 2000, he used routines, symbolic processes, political processes, communication and change tatics to try to bring about change. <list><heading>Routines and symbolic processes:</heading>Employed more staff to operate on the shop floor to directly served and helped customers as to offer a more personal service. Luc Vandevelde represented rites of challenge as he acted differently from previous CEO. Stopped using green carrier bags to present a new corporate image in March 2000. Alteration of stores, uniforms, packaging and labelling to fit with the new corporate image.Used only one distinct brand for clothing which everyone could understand. And the St Michael brand was relegated to inside clothing labels as a symbol of quality and trust.</list><list><heading>Political processes:</heading>Deals with two football clubs as part of the plan to tailor stores geographically in Feb 2000.Unveiled an exclusive clothes collection designed by haute couture fashion designers. </list><list><heading>Communiction:</heading>Vandevelde conducted many interviews to raise awareness and M&S profile.</list><list><heading>Change tatics:</heading>Vandevelde planned to revitalise the domestic brand and them go overseas with an extensive expansion programme as to change M&S to become a multi-format retailer.Grouped the stores on the bases of demographic characteristics and lifestyle patterns instead of operating with the old system which allocated merchandise dependent on the floor space. Overseas stores could develop their own strategies which ere tailored to the needs of local market.</list>However, sales remained unchanged as in 1999 and a fall in profit of £71.2m when M&S announced its figures for the year in May 2000. New measures and strategies implemented did not make any visible improvement. The clothing range performance remained bad and there were lots of excess stock. Thus Vandevelde implemented new strategy and chose different levers to try to bring about change after May 2000. <list><heading>Structure and control, routines and symbolic processes:</heading>To retain and attract the best people by asking shareholders to double the share options available for key executives.Poster with question asking 'What you were doing to bring customers back' to guide staff what they should do. Rites of sense making by creating a Customer Insight Unit to perform in-depth research with customers to gain an understanding of customers and perceptions of the M&S brand.Moved the headquarters from Baker Street, London to Paddington in Spring 2004. This showed that M&S was going to make meaningful changes and tackling the problems at its core. Launched a campaign entitled 'Fighting Back' to encourage staff to get behind M&S and make a difference in key areas of recovery.Top management was asked to work one day in a local store to get an insight into real situation in-store and to lift employee moral.New Autume-Winter fashion collection marked a return to M&S's roots with the main focus on classically styled clothing. The new range 'Per Una' was put in a separate floor space with different shop fittings from the other clothing to target a different segment, which also meant M&S was changing to more customer focus.Introduced washable suit.Implemented a store refurbishment programme.</list><list><heading>Political processes:</heading>Joint venture with one of the M&S leading suppliers, Desmond & Sons, to design and source children's clothing.Collaboration with George Davies to design a women's range called 'Per Una' that would specifically cater for M&S's fashion-conscious customers.Closed its final salary pension scheme to new members to reduce cost.</list><list><heading>Communiction:</heading>Posters appeared in staff room to remind staff M&S was changing and its new strategy.News about increasing sales and market shares to show that recovery was on track.</list><list><heading>Change tatics:</heading>Offered cloths at a discounted price in factory outlet malls to clear excess stock. Disposed its 38 stores in Europe and Brooks Brothers in America and sold the Hong Kong stores to franchises. So that M&S could focus on its core domestic clothing. Restore the confidence of its core customer by its new Autumn-Winter fashion collection and a new range of back-to-basics collection entitled 'Perfect'.Development of homeware department in existing stores, dedicated satellite outlets and expansion of 'Simple Food' convenience store format in railway and underground. </list>Vandevelde's performance was praised by shareholders. The new women's range 'Per Una', 'Perfect' range and washable suit were greatly received by customers and performed well. M&S reported better trading figures and a rise in share price in October 2001. Roger Holmes was employed to be M&S's head of UK retailing in late 2001 and was promoted to CEO in July 2002 after Vandevelde resignation. He made use of structure and control, routines, symbolic processes, political processes and change tatics. <list><heading>Structure and control, routines and symbolic processes:</heading>Spoke with actual customers and walked with them around the stores to find out what differences they did experience in M&S.Cut its contractors from four to two to produce massive saving per year and introduced new staff contacts to achieve cuts to overtime pay.</list><list><heading>Political processes:</heading>Collaboration with Davies and the recruitment of Yasmin Yusuf to produce new clothing.Alliance with David Beckham, who was seen as a natural hero and could reflect M&S's brand values, to promote its children's wear. Poached Vittorio Radice with a 1.7m npackage form the chief executive position at Selfridges to head M&S's home furnishings division.</list><list><heading>Change tatics:</heading>Injected innovation into the food ranges, such as protected its popular 'steam cuisine' by patent. Launched a nationwide credit and loyalty card scheme called '&more' to build loyalty, understand its customers and open a lasting dialogue with them .Built 'Lifestores' which only stock homeware products with a fully functioning house to let customers see the homeware range in situ. Opened more Simple Food stores in different places.</list>Under Holmes effort, Sales had risen 6.7% on Christmas trading period 2002 which outperform most of its competitors but full cost was 5% higher than previous year. Back in the rankings of the 'World's Most Respected Companies'. Won a Queens Award for Enterprise for its washable suit which had been on sale since 2001. A rise in profits and an increase to the dividend was reported in the end of year figures for 2002. Success of its '&more' card and so regained customer trust. Holmes was blamed as being too nice and took too long to make decisions. Simply food stores performed better than main stores for sales per foot. Home division started having problems and underperformed. Performance in children's and women's clothing continued to be a problem and lost market share. Failed to make an impression on the culture and did not manage to change the bureaucracy.
