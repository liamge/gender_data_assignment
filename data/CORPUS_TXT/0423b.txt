<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>This essay sets out a framework for a peoples' law tribunal (Tribunal) on the health violations suffered by the Roma community at the camps for internally displaced persons (IDP camps) administered by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Part I provides the context for the Tribunal and explains the purpose of an application of a peoples' law perspective to the violations. Part II details the proposed structure of the Tribunal, including the issues for judgment, the participants and the expected nature of the testimony. Finally, Part III explains the political vision and strategies of the Tribunal, both as an event and as a process. <heading>PART I: BACKGROUND</heading><heading>The United Nations Mission In Kosovo (UNMIK)</heading>UNMIK was established in June 1999 when the UN Security Council issued a resolution authorising the UN Secretary-General to establish an interim civil administration led by the UN in the war-ravaged province of Kosovo, following the eviction of Yugoslav troops by NATO forces.  <fnote>Resolution on the Establishment of UNMIK, SC Res 1244, UN Doc S/RES/1244 (1999). </fnote>In Kosovo, UNMIK acts not only as an international organisation, but also as a "surrogate state authority", unprecedented for a UN mission in both its scope and structural complexity. The mission "performs the whole spectrum of essential administrative functions and services covering such areas as health and education, banking and finance, post and telecommunications, and law and order." UNMIK's mandate combines elements of peace-keeping, democracy-promotion, reconstruction and economic development, institution-building and rule of law. <fnote>European Roma Rights Centre, European Court of Human Rights Has No Jurisdiction in Kosovo Lead Poisoning Case (2006) < URL > accessed on 26 March 2007. </fnote><fnote>UNMIK, UNMIK At a Glance < URL > accessed on 26 March 2007. </fnote><fnote>Ibid. </fnote><heading>Violations </heading>In June 1999, approximately 600 displaced persons, predominantly from the Roma community in Kosovo, were relocated by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to three IDP camps situated near the Trepca lead mine in Mitrovica, Kosovo. <fnote>In this essay, the term 'Roma' is used to denote the particular Roma community of Kosovo. For a discussion of the Roma range of groupings and identities worldwide, see: Minority Rights Group International website < URL > accessed on 4 April 2007. </fnote>In November 2000, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the UN specialised agency for health, issued the first in a series of reports that revealed high blood lead concentrations in all children and most adults at the IDP camps. In July 2004, WHO conducted lead exposure testing in the children of the IDP camps and concluded that 88% of the IDP camps' areas were considered unsafe for human habitation. In November 2004, WHO issued a further memo recommending that the camp population be moved away on an emergency basis.  <fnote>Sandra Molano and Andrej Andejew, 'First Phase of Public Health Project on Lead Pollution in Mitrovica Region' (2000) World Health Organization. </fnote><fnote>World Health Organization, Preliminary Report on Blood Levels in North Mitrovica and Zvecan (2004). </fnote><fnote>World Health Organization, Capillary Blood Lead Confirmation and Critical Lead-Related Health Situation of the Roma Camps Children (2004) 3. </fnote>UNMIK began temporary relocation, and proper medical treatment, of the Roma community in 2006. Permanent relocation to new housing did not commence until March 2007, almost seven years after the WHO's initial report. <fnote>'Kosovo's Displaced People Treated for Lead Poisoning', Environment News Service (New York), 1 September 2006, < URL > accessed on 7 April 2007. </fnote><fnote>Although the camps were intended only as temporary housing for RAE victims of the 1999 looting and burning of the Romani Mahala settlement in Mitrovica, it was not until 2006 that the IDPS were relocated from the lead-contaminated camps to other temporary camps, and on 7 March 2007 UNMIK reported that "after nearly eight years in makeshift camps, a number of Roma families have begun to return to south Mitrovica" to permanent housing. See: UNMIK, Kosovo: Roma return to new homes in Mitrovica with help from UN and partners (2007) < URL > accessed on 7 April 2007. </fnote>At least 25 deaths have been linked to the prolonged lead exposure. Further, many Roma of the IDP camps suffered, and continue to suffer, severe health consequences. In relation to children in particular, lead poisoning has been linked with permanent loss of cognitive function, thereby also affecting education and livelihood prospects. <fnote>Lead poisoning symptoms include loss of appetite, lethargy, high blood pressure, fertility problems, stunted growth, hearing damage, neurological damage, seizures, pain in the legs and bones, stomach cramps and vomiting.

In this regard, the European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC): filed a criminal complaint; notified the UN Human Rights Committee; attempted to commence an action at the European Court of Human Rights; requested the UN Secretary-General, UNHCHR and four Special Rapporteurs (on Housing, Toxic Wastes, Refugees, and Health respectively) to take immediate action for the preservation of the lives and health of children in the affected IDP camps, and to commence an internal investigation to ascertain how a situation (that a WHO expert had described "as one of the most serious lead-related environmental health disasters in the world and in history") was allowed to continue for more than six years; filed a third party complaint at the UN; and filed a complaint with the UN Oversight Body requesting an investigation into the mismanagement of the IDP camps in Kosovo. <fnote>European Roma Rights Centre, Criminal Complaint Against Unknown Persons (2005) filed at the Office of Public Prosecutor in Kosovo (2005) < URL > accessed on 12 March 2007. </fnote><fnote>European Roma Rights Centre, Written Comments of the ERRC Concerning Kosovo for Consideration by the United Nations Human Rights Committee on the Occasion of Review of the Country Report of Task Forces on UNMIK (2006) < URL > accessed on 12 March 2007. </fnote><fnote>On 20 February 2006, the European Roma Rights Centre filed an application on behalf of 184 IDPs at the European Court of Human Rights. On 21 February 2006, the Court notified the ERRC that it did not have the jurisdiction to review the case, since UNMIK is not party to the relevant convention.

The Politics of Judgement and an Agenda for People's Law' (2001) 2 Law, Social Justice & Global Development [Part 3] < URL > accessed on 22 March 2007. </fnote>These initiatives are founded on the re-thinking of the concept of 'law', which is generally presented as apolitical, benign and relatively static. However, research in relation to historical legal and political processes demonstrates the restriction of such an interpretation and re-conceives law as a political concept not limited solely to the national/international dichotomy. Whilst at the present time the law predominantly manifests in accordance with the interests of dominant neoliberal-led globalisation(s), its emanicipatory potential is also apparent in relation to communities of suffering around the world. In addition to resistance and activism within law, it becomes possible to imagine resistance to the current conception of law. If 'law' itself is a malleable concept and can be viewed as a "discursive terrain", it can be re-thought as a powerful tool for those with less power in today's world order. <fnote>See, for example: Antony Anghie, 'Time Present and Time Past: Globalization, International Financial Institutions, and the Third World' (1999-2000) 32 New York University Journal of International Law and Politics 243; Balakrishnan Rajagopal, International Law from Below (2003) ch 4; China Miéville, Between Equal Rights: A Marxist Theory of International Law (2005) ch 6; and B.S.

In this regard, a peoples' law perspective offers an approach to resisting and confronting the law, and effect a re-appropriation of the common (including free access to and control over knowledge, information, communication and affects). <fnote>Caleb Smith and Enrico Minardi, Interview with Michael Hardt (North Carolina, 5 March 2004) question 2 < URL > accessed on 10 March 2007. </fnote><fnote>Chamsy el-Ojeili and Patrick Hayden, Critical Theories of Globalization (2006), 203. </fnote>A peoples' law perspective facilitates the re-appropriation of 'law' primarily through the recognition of the 'crime of silence' and a re-claiming (by subaltern, less powerful singularities) of judgment, authorship, control and action in relation to specific violations as well as in relation to the wider complex global interactions, processes and institutions of the present hegemonic world order.  <fnote>Nayar, above no 25, 321-322. </fnote><heading>Application of the Foundational Principles</heading><heading>(i) Judgment </heading>The primary issue for judgment is the accountability of the UN for health violations of the Roma community in the IDP camps administered by UNMIK. The Tribunal process commences with a repudiation of the normalcy of 'expected' and 'inevitable' delays, inconveniences and lack of funds in a post-conflict situation administered by the UN, and provides a platform from which the Roma can reclaim their histories, future and 'truth' by re-framing their treatment by UNMIK from a discourse of 'mere misfortune' to one of judgment of violations. Thus, the Tribunal aims challenge the 'crime of silence' in relation to the health violations of the Roma in the IDP camps and, as a wider concern, seeks to situate the violations within a broader global movement that examines the systematic, structural violation against minority communities resulting from a privileging of other interests (for example, 'development', 'nation-building', 'democracy', 'security' and the interests of transnational corporations) over human rights relating to health and life. <heading>(ii) Authorship</heading>The Tribunal is a forum for the Roma to resist the dominant ideology by reclaiming the power or right to author their version of the 'law' and to define the structures and nature of social relationships conducive to a life of security and welfare. The dominant legality promises, through myriad human rights treaties, international and national legislation, a world order of equality and compassion. In relation to the specific situation, multiple human rights standards exist that are applicable to the Roma in this context that have ostensibly been breached by the (in)actions of UNMIK. <fnote>For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, guidelines in relation to IDPs, Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, among others. </fnote>In light of this and as steps taken within the current legal framework were unable to assist the Roma effectively, the Tribunal is an attempt to re-think the 'law' and to generate imaginations for new political action. The adopted discourse does not derive its validity from any formal source of law, nor from any validation by institutions of power but instead derives from the assertion of the power of peoples' voice and judgment.  <fnote>Nayar, above no 25, 325-326. </fnote><heading>(iii) Control</heading>The Tribunal is a space for the Roma to control (and not merely participate in) the processes of decision-making and judgment in relation to the matters which affect the daily life-conditions of their communities. In relation to the specific situation, it is apparent that the Roma have suffered as 'victims' of the health violations. As to the wider background conditions leading to such violations, it is important to recognise a shared responsibility, as complex interrelated global practices, inaction and relations each contribute to long-term circumstances of structural injustice. Accordingly, given this outlook, it would be beneficial ultimately to remove the focus on a 'victims' perspective' as without accepting shared responsibility, it is difficult to re-claim the responsibility, power and direct space for re-claiming truth, of each individual, which can be focused towards shared goals (representing 'a multitude of singularities'). <fnote>For an interesting discussion of the concept of 'political responsibility' (which expands on the notions of 'fault/strict liability' and emphasises the shared responsibility of all, through action and non-action in complex global processes, for violations throughout the world, see: Iris Marion Young, 'Responsibility and Global Labor Justice' (2004) 12(4) The Journal of Political Philosophy 365. </fnote><heading>(iv) Action</heading>The Tribunal recognises the right of the Roma to effect the implementation of their alternative visions of social relationships in ways which reinforce and celebrate the diversity of humanity, for humanity. <heading>Tribunal Initiation and Timing</heading>It is envisaged that the Roma community and the ERRC will be the joint initiators of the Tribunal, the former for its personal experience and the latter primarily for the following reasons: knowledge of the history and discrimination against the Roma communities of Europe generally; knowledge of the specific situation that is the subject of the Tribunal; continuity given ERRC's series of attempts to facilitate justice; resources and ability to organise the Tribunal and subsequently mobilise the public and other NGOs and CSOs. <fnote>European Roma Rights Centre, 'Justice for Kosovo' (2005) 3, 4 Roma Rights Quarterly < URL > accessed on 16 March 2007. </fnote>The Tribunal will be held during the period of UN discussion regarding the future status of Kosovo, in order to attract maximum attention from the public/media, and to place pressure on the UN and other relevant bodies to give due consideration to the violations and incorporate justice into any plans for Kosovo.  <fnote>UNMIK, Ban Ki-moon receives proposals for future status of UN-administered Kosovo (2007) < URL > accessed on 7 April 2007. </fnote><fnote>This could be defined as a 'strategy of democratisation', whereby "facts and figures are given a voice, a face and a story, and [the story] told in public by people whose lives have been damaged", see Ulrich Beck, Power in the Global Age (2005) 245. </fnote><heading>PART II: TRIBUNAL FRAMEWORK</heading><heading>Originating declaration (judgment)</heading>Through its (in)actions, the UN/UNMIK has violated the health, lives and livelihood prospects of the Roma community housed at the IDP camps in Kosovo. As a starting point, the Tribunal will consider the following violations: Against the Roma community: a wrong of inaction: neglect in the duty to take positive action to rectify health violations expeditiously a wrong of silence: neglect of the duty to give privilege and duty to voices of suffering Against humanity (in addition to the above): a wrong of exclusion: complicity in the exclusion of the voices and visions of communities of less power in the current hegemonic world order, as a result of the privileging of economic and political interests over peoples' aspirations of security, well-being and justice <heading>Participants, Testimony and Roles</heading>The Tribunal will undertake to gather evidence and documentation systematically in order to meet the most rigorous requirements of international legal norms with a view to exposing the violations of, and gaps in relation to, existing promises of human rights. Further, participants will be requested to provide sex- and age-disaggregated data where available, to reflect the different impact of the health violations on women, men and children, in order to expose details of any systematic violations. The following people will be invited to participate in the Tribunal process, to provide testimony/take action as indicated: (1) Roma representatives and their supporters (predominately from ERRC) Mix of first person and advocacy testimony in relation to: (a) The IDP camp environment, health violations suffered, (in)action taken by UNMIK, steps taken by the Roma in response to the health violations. Due consideration to the safety of the Roma and repercussions resulting from their involvement in the tribunal will be required. <fnote>European Roma Rights Centre, above no 13, 2. It is noted in the Complaint that "Their names are not public because of serious concerns of [sic] their safety and fears of any violence or other repercussion following this complaint." </fnote>(b) The wider context of discrimination against the Roma community in Europe and Kosovo, the health violations at the IDP camps, steps taken by ERRC to attempt to achieve justice. (2) UNMIK and UN representatives First person testimony in relation to: the wider context of UNMIK's role in Kosovo, the IDP camp environment, steps taken to relocate and medically treat the Roma, the role of and any accountability attributable to Kosovo municipalities/Ministry of Health as far as they existed during the relevant time period. (3) Medical experts (WHO/independent) First person testimony in relation to the causes, severity and consequences of the health violations suffered. (4) The jury A jury panel consisting of representatives from the Roma community and experts in the fields of human rights, minority rights, Kosovo, health and international law will be asked to deliberate on the evidence presented and reach a formal Tribunal decision. (5) The audience The Tribunal will be open to the members of the Roma community and their supporters, members of the UN/UN missions (as representatives of the key institution of focus), and the public generally. The audience will be requested to deliberate on the evidence presented, galvanise world public opinion and reach as many people as possible who can take action in response to the truths revealed. <heading>Issues for Consideration</heading>The Tribunal process follows a twofold conceptual framework, namely an investigation of the wrongs committed against the Roma people in the IDP camps, as well as an investigation into the unjust background and structural conditions that ought to be addressed in order to re-claim the 'law' from a more compassionate perspective. (1) Investigation into the severe legal, political, social, ethical, cultural wrongs against the Roma people including specific crimes and violations. In order to reach a decision, evidence and testimonies will be considered by the Tribunal, and decisions reached, in relation to the following issues: Whether the treatment of the Roma in the camps violated existing international, regional and national laws specifically, as well as humanity's values of peace, justice and non-violence generally. The accountability and liability of the UN/UNMIK (and other relevant UN departments or agencies, or other institutions or groups generally) in relation to the health violations. Whether international and regional institutions forming the current world legal order, such as the European Court of Human Rights, are guilty of complicity in their failure to respond positively to requests for assistance. (2) Investigation into the background and structural conditions that made possible the crimes and violations. Beyond determining the specific crimes committed, and re-claiming voices, regarding the accepted normalisation of the post-conflict treatment of the Roma community, the situation raises wider issues of concern that are critical for the collective decisions of the Tribunal and world public opinion. In order to consider the broader implications, the following issues will be considered: The role of the UN in post-conflict situations (particularly the unprecedented roles undertaken by evolving peacebuilding missions). Why is the UN unable or unwilling to uphold its own human rights agenda in relation to individuals under its express care? What interests and agendas does the UN privilege in such circumstances? What ideology is revealed through the UN's democratisation project, and what implications does this have for the incorporation of post-conflict states into the 'modern' (economic) world order, as a continuing colonisation project? <fnote>Balakrishan Rajagopal, 'From Modernization to Democratization' in Richard Falk, Lester Edwin J. Ruiz and R.B.J.Walker (eds) Reframing the International: Law, Culture, Politics (2002) chap 7. </fnote>The impact of the specific situation on the credibility of the UN (and other international political-legal institutions and courts) generally. What are the future implications for the role of the UN system and the international human rights framework to provide a credible means by which the aspirations and the will of the global population may be effected? The impact of the camp situation on the global health environment and human rights. Whilst the UN selected the locations of the IDP camps, what action, if any, should be taken against the owners of the Trepca mine? What implications arise in relation to the ability of corporations to pollute the environment with impunity? The impact of the situation on the Roma diaspora generally throughout Europe. What implications does the (in)action by the UN, as the purported highest advocate of human rights, have for the world order in relation to communities with less power? The impact of the Kosovo circumstances and war that lead to the displacement of the Roma community and the need for UNMIK to administer the IDP camps. <fnote>It is noted that this issue is very complex and, for the most part, beyond the scope of the present Tribunal. For an interesting and instructive application of a peoples' law perspective to the issue of war, see: World Tribunal of Iraq website at < URL > accessed on 10 April 2007. </fnote><heading>PART III: STRATEGIES AND VISION OF TRIBUNAL</heading><heading>The Tribunal as an Event</heading>Through the use of the peoples' law principles outlined above, the Tribunal (including its announcement and organisation) will effect declarative, deliberative and mandating functions in relation to the specific violations as follows: (1) The Tribunal represents a supportive public space in which to articulate and create a historical record of the violations, and to highlight the failure of existing mechanisms to address human rights abuses. This re-claims 'law' for the violated community, affirms solidarity with minority communities, and educates the public. Instead of continually reliving 'yesterday's' world legal order, all stages of the Tribunal will assume conscious responsibility (both individual and shared) for the construction of an alternative reality. (2) The Tribunal will provide a process of listening, reflection and evaluation. A considered and informed decision shall be rendered on the issues presented to the Tribunal, with such decision to be widely distributed throughout the world for the benefit of individuals and groups struggling for peace and justice. (3) To this end, the Tribunal will highlight existing action, consider and decide upon strategic action to be taken at all appropriate levels, with the aim of reclaiming the power of enforcement in terms of acting upon the judgments reached to mobilise world public opinion to invigorate social and political pressure. The purpose of such pressure will be to contribute to efforts to bring the UN/UNMIK to account as part of the overall campaign to put an end to both the impunity enjoyed by international institutions in relation to violations against minority communities, and the privileging of economic or political interests over basic human rights concerns. Any such strategic action is likely to include: the removal of all Roma from contaminated areas; the provision of appropriate and comprehensive medical treatment to all affected persons desiring such treatment; ongoing medical, financial and other relevant support for long-term health consequences and any other consequences arising from the delay in rectifying the violations (such as loss of employment opportunities and learning difficulties in children due to permanent cognitive dysfunction). <heading>The Tribunal as a Process</heading>In addition to any mandated action in relation to the specific subject violations, the Tribunal is a contribution to a peoples' law movement generally (through a recording of alternative 'truths' to preserve against the dominant writing of history) and a practical application of a new political project that rejects the current unjust world order and imagines alternatives. It is likely that issues will arise during the Tribunal process that will require further investigation, deliberation and action that may not be finalised within the scope of the Tribunal. The Tribunal process ought to indicate at least such need and call on further initiatives to follow these up. The power of enforcement lies in the ability of the Tribunal, as a component part of a creative global movement for peace and justice, to appeal to public conscience and to mobilise around the emerging truths to create political pressure throughout the world. The actual steps to be taken, and the relevant actors to call upon, will depend on the Tribunal process. However, at this stage, it is envisaged that recommended options may include: the agreement by relevant NGOs or other civil society organisations to monitor the situation in Kosovo; the establishment of further tribunals in relation to human rights in UN missions; a series of workshops within UN bodies, and between UN representatives and relevant groups to learn from the violations and discuss alternative future approaches or priorities in peacekeeping. <fnote>For a discussion of the difficulties related to the attempted mainstreaming of human rights into all political, development, and other initiatives by the UN, see: Hurst Hannum, 'Human Rights in Conflict Resolution: The Role of the Officer of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in UN Peacemaking and Peacebuilding' (2006) 28(1) Human Rights Quarterly 1. </fnote>
