The results showed a tendency of decrease blood pressure and heart rate when subject change their body posture form standing to sitting, and form sitting to supine. Although all five subjects show a tendency of decreasing blood pressure and heart rate, the degree of change is closely related to the rate of baroreceptor reflex of the subject. Baroreceptors are located in the upper thorax and the neck, known as the carotid sinus baroreceptor and the aortic baroreceptor. As the blood pressure increase, the baroreceptors are activated and action potentials are generated and travels along the Vagus nerve or Hering's nerve, to the tractus solitarius of the medulla. The secondary signals inhibit the vasoconstrictor centre and excite the Vagal centre. Those changes will elicit two next effects: 1) vasodilatation thoughtout the peripheral circulatory system and 2) decreased heart rate and strength of heart contraction. This reflex is very important in the homeostasis. It is essential to maintain relatively constant arterial pressure when a person sits after having been lying down. Immediately upon standing, the arterial pressure in the head and upper body tends to fall. This marked reduction of blood pressure could cause loss of consciousness. The baroreceptor reflex mechanism helps the bring the blood pressure and heart rate back to normal level and therefore maintaining a sustainable cardiac output. <heading>Part B: Measurement of the ECG</heading><figure/>The ECG trace represents the strength and direction of cardiac action potentials travel along the heart chambers. The P wave corresponds to the atrial excitation; atrial myocytes are depolarized, and produces a P wave last for approximately 0.8 seconds. The PR interval represents the time taken for excitation to spread through the atria, AV- node and the bundle of His into the ventricle. The PR interval should not last more than 0.2 second. A longer interval indicates a fault in conduction pathway which called a heart block. The QRS complex marks the ventricular excitation. The rapid depolarization of large amount of ventricular myocytes produces a big deflection. The complex normally last 0.1s or less, longer intervals indicate bundle branch block or a ventricular ectopic beat. The ST segment, represent the maximum ventricular action potential and the rapid ejection phase. As the ventricle is uniformly depolarized, the ST segment should be isoelectric. However, if a region of ventricular myocardium is damaged by ischaemia, the ST segment will no longer be isoelectric. Location of ST segment is characterised by different heart abnormalities. In chronic myocardial ischaemia, the ST segement is depressed, while the ST segement is elevated immediately after an acute myocardial infarction. The T wave marks the repolarization. Repolarization is a relatively slow process compare to depolarization. Noted that mycocardial ischaemia not only shift the ST segment but can also cause the T wave inversion. The ECG traces return to isoelectric state before the next cardiac cycle start. Amount the three subjects taken in account in this experiment, almost all of their ECG trace follow the typical pattern and time. Apart form the Lead Ⅲform subject B shown a T wave inversion, this is probably due to the poor connects between electrodes. The table below summarize clinical assessments can be made form the ECG trace. <table/><heading>Part C: Human Skin Circulation </heading>venous pressure Observation: Refilling is much slower then normal when the hand reaches the level of manubrosternal junction, and above this junction the veins are collapsed and almost empty. Explanation: In the arm veins, the pressure at the level of rib is usually about +6mmHg according to the compression of the subclavian vein as it passes over the ribs. The hydrostatic pressure down the length of arm totally depends on the distance below the level of rib. In this experiment, as the subject gradually raise the hand towards the manubriosternal junction, the hydrostatic pressure in veins decrease. Therefore, the refill becomes much slower and may even appear to be collapsed and almost empty. b) Harvey's experiment to demonstrate valves in the veins. Observation: 'lumps' appeared in regular interval indicate the presents of valves. Explanation: valves are presents in veins to prevent the back flow of blood. The white reaction Observation: Blanching extends for a few mm form the scratched skin. Explanation: Immediate blockage of capillaries due to addition of pressure. If high pressure is applied, capillaries will be damaged and blood leaks out around the wound. <list>The triple responseObservation: ⅰ) a red line under the contact track (the 'red' reaction)ⅱ) an ill- defined, reddish surround ('flare')ⅲ) a slight oedema developing along the track ('weal')</list>The red line appeared about 1 minute after contact track. After that, a 'flare' gradually develops and slight oedema builds up around 7-10minutes Explanation: capillaries or even venules can be damaged by mild injury, causing haemorrhage. A blood clot develops rapidly and white blood cells in lymph storage comes along, phagocytose any foreign material and dead tissues.
