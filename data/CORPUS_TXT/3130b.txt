<heading>Summary of Case Study</heading>Name: Rosemary Age: 58 Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis aged 42. Occupation: Part time job at day centre for people with Multiple Sclerosis. Home: Lives with husband in a ground floor flat adapted to accommodate her needs as a wheelchair user. Family: Two adult children who live within ten miles. Rosemary's husband is her main carer; he has noticed a change in Rosemary. Hobbies: Using computer and cooking. Personal: Rosemary has adjusted well to her illness and embraced the challenges that have come with it. However recently she has become frustrated and anxious. History of OT interventions: Rosemary has been open to adaptations in the past. <heading>Reasons for referral</heading>1) Rosemary is experiencing an exacerbation in her condition and is therefore finding her motor skills have deteriorated making it difficult and frustrating to handle small objects and to work on her computer. These motor skills need to be assessed and equipment provided as indicated. 2) Rosemary is anxious about having to leave the day centre when she is 60 and would like to explore other vocational interests. <heading>Summary of Multiple Sclerosis </heading>A Progressive Neurological condition. Multiple plaques of demyelination occur which are caused by the immune system attacking the neurons within the central nervous system (Kumar and Clark 2002). Visual, motor, sensory, cognitive, psychological, bowel and bladder systems can be affected (Hanson and Atchison 2000). Fatigue is common (Tipping in Turner 2002). There are different types of MS but it is generally characterised by exacerbations, remissions or a progression which result in temporary, transient or permanent loss of function (Pedretti and McCormack 1985). <heading>Information Gathering</heading><heading>Information from other disciplines</heading>G.P: Patterns to Rosemary's condition; Medical treatments and effects; Other relevant medical information. Rosemary's husband: Is he willing and able to support Rosemary with her goals? How can we plan a client centred approach that does not disrupt family life? The day centre: Adaptive technology; alternative vocations or roles. The disability employment advisor: Employer responsibilities; Rosemary's rights. Physiotherapist: Exercise programs. <heading>Assessments</heading><heading>Non-Standardised = The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</heading>This assessment focuses on the areas of self care, productivity and leisure. The individual being assessed rates the importance of tasks within these areas. This will confirm and possibly introduce where Rosemary needs support. <heading>Standardised = The Ashworth Spasticity Scale</heading>This assessment will measure on a scale of 0-4 the levels of spasticity within muscle groups and their control over movement (Silcox 2003). In order to ensure it is valid Rosemary would need to take this test at different times of day on different days. This test will reliably establish Rosemary's motor skills. <heading>Initial Interview</heading>An informal discussion with Rosemary to establish whether initial information and referral is akin to Rosemary's perspective and to determine social and cultural needs which are at present unclear. <heading>Planning Intervention</heading><heading>Rosemary's Priorities</heading><list>Exploration of alternative vocations.Consideration of adaptations.Maintenance of motor skills.Ability to use phone and computer.Maintenance of independence.Occupation on leaving day centre.</list><heading>Defining the problem</heading><list><heading>Leisure</heading>Using keyboard and mouse; poor co-ordination, muscle weakness and tremors.</list><list><heading>Work</heading>Holding telephone receiver; difficulty grasping and muscle weakness.Concern about having to leave the day centre at 60 and having no occupation.</list>Rosemary's problems occur in work and leisure and are a result of reduced manual dexterity and changing roles. Productivity and leisure are usually the most important occupations for those with MS because they allow the individual to maintain a sense of purpose in life (Bodium, 1999, in Turner). <heading>Rosemary's Strengths</heading><list>Positive attitude to therapy interventions. Love of new challenges. Successful completion of computer course.Being a good cook.Supportive and close family. Valued member of the day centre both to staff and clients. </list><heading>Intervention and Rationale</heading><heading>Model</heading>I have chosen to use the Person-Environment-Occupation Model (PEO). This model focuses on the individual engaging in purposeful activities and tasks within their chosen environment to fulfil various roles. Occupational performance is central to this model. This will suit Rosemary's desire to continue in activities of work and leisure by exploring and solving the associated problems. Within this model the environment is more amendable to change than the person (Hagedorn 2001). <heading>Frame of reference : Rehabilitation</heading>Reduced manual dexterity cannot always be improved by therapeutic activity and the provision of assistive devices is usually necessary (Silcox, 2003). I will therefore include adaptive technology and orthosis. This avoids over tiring limbs which can exacerbate the symptoms of MS (Tipping in Turner 2002). Rosemary will be able to use her love of meeting new challenges and her positive attitude to adaptations and skills in technology to overcome problems with motor skills and concern over her future. By focusing on the environment Rosemary will not be under pressure to continually learn new skills without having to continuously re-learn motor skills which can be frustrating and cause feelings of depression or anxiety (Johnson in Turner 2000). <heading>Goal Planning</heading><heading>Overarching aim</heading>For Rosemary to continue to be occupied by work and leisure activities within her chosen environments. <heading>Long term aim</heading>To maintain motor function and to be independent with tasks needed for occupations of work and leisure. <heading>Short term goals</heading>To use her computer keyboard and mouse within three weeks. To be independent and pain free in answering the telephone at work within two weeks. To decide upon possible alternative vocations within 4 weeks. To maintain motor skills over five weeks. <heading> Steps/tasks to achieve goals</heading>To choose and install a computer package such as "Dragon" to eliminate the need to use hands. (The Multiple Sclerosis resource centre 2005). To practise using this computer package for 10 hours a week, on days when she is not too tired, to write a list of possible alternative vocations and to write letters to request information on these vocations. To purchase a telephone headset and to practise using it at home over the next week and to take it to work to use within two weeks. For Rosemary to use her computer mouse for a period of half an hour 3 times a week to look for alternative vocations on the internet, whilst wearing a cock up wrist splint. For Rosemary to practise taking splint on and off with therapist. <heading>Evaluation</heading><heading>Monitoring</heading><list>One week: Discuss using splint.Two weeks: Review use of the hands free headset. Three weeks: Discuss using computer software. Four weeks: Review and discuss vocations.Five weeks: To discuss and review motor skills.</list><heading>Re-assessment: After 5 weeks</heading>COPM assessment; this would indicate whether Rosemary feels her performance and level of satisfaction are improved within the areas she has defined. The Ashworth Spasticity test to determine whether Rosemary's motor skills have been affected. <heading>Final Interviews: After 6 weeks</heading>A discussion with to determine whether or not she feels further OT interventions would benefit her. <heading>Further Interventions</heading>From these interviews and re-assessments further or alternative interventions could be planned.
