<abstract><heading>Abstract:</heading>Formation of the vertebrate limb requires specification of cell position along 3 axes: the proximal-distal axis, the antero-posterior axis and the dorso-ventral axis. These 3 axes are governed by signalling centres: the apical ectodermal ridge and the progress zone for the proximal distal elements, the polarizing activity region for the antero-posterior axis and the overlying ectoderm that determines the dorso-ventral axis. These signalling centres emanate proteins which cross-talk linking the formation of each axis to each other. A decade of intensive studies has identified some signals that pattern the different axes. The apical ectodermal ridge releases Fibroblast growth fators (Fgfs) in particular Fgf- 4 and Fgf-8 which mimic it if removed. Fgf-8 is also involved in the formation of the fore and hind limb formation as it forms a feedback loop with Fgf-10 mediated by Wnt3a, which is induced by Tbx 5 and 4 via Wnt2b and Wnt8c respectively. The polarizing activity region releases Sonic Hegdhog (Shh), a limb morphogen, which is induced by Gli3 a protein implicated in human Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, which forms a feedback loop (mediated by Formin, Gremlin, a Bmp antagonist and of course Bmp) with Fgf-8 and Fgf-4. Sonic Hedgehog is also induced by dHand, a transcription factor, and in the forelimb by Hoxb8. However, dorso-ventral patterning is very different as it does not rely on a gradient of expression but more on an ON/OFF system. Wnt7a, another member of the Wnt family, is restricted to the dorsal region by Engrailed1 and induces the expression of Lmx1 without Î²-catenin dependent activity to specify the dorsal fate. It is also required for maintenance of Shh and thus Fgf signalling. </abstract><heading>Introduction:</heading><quote>"What can be more curious than the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that a mole for digging, the leg of a horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat should all be constructed on the same pattern and should include similar bones, and in the same relative positions?" Darwin(1859).</quote>This quote from Charles Darwin highlights the intrigue that is the making of the vertebrate limb and how it has been conserved in evolution and between the different vertebrates. This is an extremely complex organ, which is not necessary for embryonic survival (therefore makes it a fantastic candidate for studying how structures develop in the right places in the embryo), is initiated when the vertebrate body plan is being mapped out and finished when the precise array of organised cells and tissues have been generated. The question the developmental biologists seek to answer is: how is the vertebrate limb made? Limb patterning is established along 3 dimensions: the proximal-distal axis which consists in the replacement of the initial cartilage by bone and accompanied by the rises of the stylopod (humerus/femur), zeugopod (radius, ulna/ tibia and fibula) and autopod (carpal fingers/ankle and toes). The second axis is the anterior-posterior axis (thumb to little finger) and finally the third one is the dorsal-ventral axis (knuckles/palm respectively). Figure 1 represents a schematic diagram of these 3 axes and a recapitulatory of all the terms and their definitions used in this review can be viewed in the end table. <picture/>In order to analyse the making of a vertebrate limb, the 3 different pattern of development must be discussed. <heading>I) Generation of the proximal-distal axis in the vertebrate limb</heading><heading>A) Apical ectodermal function and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) roles</heading>The proximal - distal axis is patterned through an organizing centre known as the apical ectodermal ridge (AER). This self-perpetuating structure forms at the boundary between the dorsal and ventral ectoderm (Niswander, 2003). It becomes visible as a continuous epithelial layer protruding from the distal tip of the limb bud. This structure can be viewed in figure 2. <picture/>AER formation involves 3 steps. Precursors are first induced; they then spread over a large area of ectoderm. Following their migration, they are concentrated at the dorso-ventral junction of the limb bud and this defines the compaction step (see section III) (Tickle, 2004; Niswander, 2003). Following experiments in which the entire ridge was removed and resulted in the cessation of outgrowth and a truncated limb, it was concluded that this organization centre is critical for the developing limb and each step mentioned is mediated by key signal which will be discussed later (Mahmood et al., 1995; Niswander et al., 1993; Niswander, 2003). Subadjacent to it is a region of mesenchyme (see end table for definition) which contains undifferentiated progenitors of the limb skeletal elements and called the progress zone. Two models have been proposed to explain the specification of proximal-distal elements: the progress zone model and the early specification model. A comparison of the two models is shown in figure 3. Another region of mesenchyme caudal and proximal to the progress zone is the polarizing region which is the source of polarizing activity. This zone was defined following experiments which resulted in mirror image digit duplications (see figure 4 for a representation of these interacting regions). <figure/><picture/>AER function is specified by the fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs). It is a gene family containing 15 known members that encode heparin-binding proteins which most of them are secreted constitutively. They are essential for the induction of the mesoderm, vascularization and maintenance of the ridge. These genes were identified to encode the outgrowth signals as beads soaked in Fgf could substitute for the apical ectodermal ridge and sustain limb bud outgrowth (Niswander et al., 1993; Tickle, 2004; Mahmood et al., 1995). Two protein members seem to be more involved than the others: Fgf-4 and Fgf-8. Although these proteins have the same overall effect, their signal transduction pathway differs greatly. Fgf-8, previously identified as androgen-induced growth factor, is believed to be the most divergent member of the family since its amino acid sequence shows the least similarity than the others. It therefore probably regulates developmental processes not previously associated with Fgfs (Mahmood et al., 1995). Fgf-8 is expressed in all three germ layers and in 2 neuromeric boundary regions of the brain (Mahmood et al., 1995). Its expression in those regions suggests that it might affect morphogenetic movements or cell adhesive processes that help to establish the initial number of cell in the early limb bud and the also play a role in spatial organization (Mahmood et al., 1995; Niswander, 2003). Interestingly, the use of whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization, has detected Fgf-8 RNA in nephrogenic mesoderm cells adjacent to the Wolfian duct prior to their differentiation, suggesting that its expression is linked to embryonic kidney development and has very important role in tubulogenesis (Crossley et al., 1996). However, the most striking role of Fgf-8 is in its involvement in AER derived mitogenic activity that regulates limb bud outgrowth (see section B). This was stated due to its presence in the ectoderm of limb bud prior to the onset of limb bud growth in both mouse and chicken embryos. However, it is not sufficient to induce a limb; it probably acts in conjunction with other determinants such as retinoic acid or other Hox genes. It is also involved in the compaction step of the ridge formation (Niswander, 2003). This protein signals through Fgfr2, which belongs to the fibroblast growth factor receptor family. This is a group of four transmembrane proteins with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (Xu et al., 1998). They all share common features (they are listed in table 1 along with their role) and all have the same signalling pathway. See figure 5 for a schematic representation. <figure/>But the most important domain is the immunoglobulin (Ig) like domain. Deletion of this domain or inactivation using a Cre recombinase uncouples the interaction between Fgf-8 and Fgf-10 (which defines the reciprocal regulation loop) resulting in limbless embryos (Xu et al., 1998). It is therefore critical for Fgf binding and for normal Fgfr2 activity. Figure 6 represents a schematic diagram of this interaction. <picture/>A characteristic that differentiates Fgf-4 from Fgf-8 is the receptor it binds to. Fgf-4 binds to Fgfr-1, which is expressed in mesenchyme. Fgf-4 is efficiently secreted from cells and along with Fgf-9 and Fgf-17 is expressed in the posterior part of the ridge (Niswander et al., 1993; Tickle, 2004). Fgf-4 can also substitute for the ridge but although the limb develops completely, there are a few digit abnormalities. This suggests that Fgf-4 does not perform the mechanical function of the ridge (Niswander et al., 1993). Fgf-4 and Fgf-8 do show redundancy as Fgf-4 also maintains Shh expression (See section II). This property is also shared with Fgf-9 and Fgf-17. Nonetheless, this redundancy is partial as in Fgf-4 conditional mutants, the limb forms normally showing that Fgf-4 is not essential for limb induction (Niswander, 2003). Another feature in which Fgf-8 differs from Fgf-4 is that the latter is critical for the progress zone cell proliferation (Niswander et al., 1993). <table/>There are 3 hypotheses that relate Fgf signalling to the proximal-distal patterning: according to the progress zone model, Fgf signalling could be related to a developmental clock based on oscillations, as cells leave the progress zone, they leave Fgf influence. Another hypothesis is that there is continuous interaction between the mesenchyme and the AER throughout limb but outgrowth, leading to increasing levels of Fgf production and that these levels specify the proximo-distal fate. And finally, a possible explanation that specifies a role of Fgfs in the Dudley et al model is that Fgfs form a gradient, by diffusing Fgfs from the ridge, which specifies position along the proximal-distal axis (Tickle, 2004). Once the Fgfs have performed their role, they are down - regulated, mesenchyme proliferation ceases and the apical ectodermal ridge regresses, returning to a flattened epithelium (Niswander, 2003). <heading>B) The formation of the limb bud and the identification of the hind and forelimbs. </heading>Limb bud induction occurs progressively and at different stages in different tetrapods. It first begins when mesenchyme cells proliferate from the somatic layer of the limb field lateral plate mesoderm and from the somites. These cells to accumulate under the ectodermal tissue to create a circular bulge: the limb bud (Gilbert, 2003). Limb induction engages 3 distinct gene families: the Fibroblast growth factor family, the Wnt family and the Tbx family. From the Fgf family, 2 actors impose themselves: Fgf-10 and Ffg-8 as seen above. Fgf-10 protein has various roles, and is not only limited to limb bud induction: it's a brain regulator and it is required for lung formation (Sekine et al., 1999). The latter was suggested due following Fgf-10 deficient mice that were generated using embryonic stem cells in which a targeting vector construct had replaced Fgf-10 exon. The resulting mice died shortly after birth: they were fore and hind limbness as the limb bud had been initiated but did not outgrowth and displayed pulmonary branching morphogenesis disruption (Sekine et al., 1999). Like stated above, it has to interact with Fgf-8 in order to induce a limb. Recent work has however updated the reciprocal regulation loop. Three members have now emerged as to mediate the interaction between Fgf-8 and Fgf-10 as Fgfs do not diffuse very far and when a Fgf-8 soaked bead is implanted in the flank, it takes as long as 17hr to induce Fgf-10 expression in the surface ectoderm in the lateral plate mesoderm contrasting with the rapid activation of other limb genes in response to Fgf beads. The first mediator is Wnt-2b, a member of the Wnt family , showed by whole-mount in situ hybridization of embryos to be expressed (and restricted) in the chick wing region (forelimb) and to act upstream of Fgf-10 in the lateral plate mesoderm during limb initiation (Kawakami et al., 2001). The second mediator detected by a similar experiment is Wnt8c which is expressed in the leg (hind limb) and acts as a regulator of Fgf-10 expression in the lateral plate mesoderm of the hind limb region (Kawakami et al., 2001). And finally, the 3 rd mediator appears to be implicated in the reciprocal regulation loop. These intermediate factors all have activities that are Î²-catenin dependent: when Î²-catenin is blocked in both the fore and hind limbs forming regions (using axin, a negative regulator of the Wnt pathway, which was over expressed using an adenoviral vector) limb development is impaired (Tickle and MÃ¼nsterberg, 2001; Kawakami et al., 2001). The third family that is critical for fore and hind limb development is the Tbx family. This family of gene encodes T-box transcription factors with the T-box domain binding DNA as a dimer (Rodriguez-Esteban et al., 1999; Rallis et al., 2003). Two members are specifically expressed in the hind and fore limb buds: Tbx 5 and Tbx4. These appear to be the most upstream factors in limb initiation. This is supported by 3 lines of evidence: mice carrying a null mutation in Tbx5 and Tbx4 (using the Cre recombinase) failed to express Fgf10 in the fore limb and hind limb respectively (Takeuchi et al., 2003; Rallis et al., 2003), Tbx5 mutation in human causes Holt-Gram syndrome (a dominant disorder characterised by upper limb defects and heart abnormalities), and misexpression experiments using RCAS retroviral vector to produce Tbx4 and Tbx5 dominant-negative forms resulted in failure of wing and leg to form respectively (Takeuchi et al., 2003). Recent work has also shown that there is a regulatory loop between Hox9 and Tbx for both limb initiation and the wing/leg identity specification (Takeuchi et al., 2003). Figure 7 shows the expanded model of this reciprocal loop. <figure/><heading>II) The establishment of the anterior-posterior axis</heading><heading>A) Front line</heading>Normal antero-posterior patterning in the limb depends on the zone of polarizing activity. This crucial signalling centre releases a number of signals (Niswander, 2003). The first identified signal, using whole-mount in situ hybridization is Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein, which has the main attribute of the limb morphogen in that it acts by forming a gradient across the early bud and is diffusible (Tickle, 2004; Riddle et al., 1993). Degenerate polymerase chain reaction primers corresponding to a sequence highly conserved between drosophila Hedgehog (produced by a set of cells in the posterior of each segment) and mouse desert Hedgehog (Dhh) was used to amplify and screen an amplified cDNA library. This resulted in the isolation of a 16.6kb cDNA clone whose gene was name Shh (Riddle et al., 1993). Its attribute as a morphogen arises from graft experiments in which small blocks of limb tissue were grafted to the anterior of host limb buds and the strength of the ZPA activity was quantified according to the degrees of digit duplication to determine the extent of correlation between the spatial and temporal pattern of ZPA activity and Shh expression (Riddle et al., 1993). The outcome of this experiment was that Shh signalling is pivotal in controlling both digit number and identity (Tickle, 2004). Further evidence support this statement as application of Shh expressing cells or recombinant Shh protein to the anterior of the chick limb bud causes mirror-image digit duplications of the type: 4-3-3-4 and 4-3-2-2-3-4 (Niswander, 2003; Riddle et al., 1993). Figure 8 shows these mirror- image duplications. <picture/>The patterning effects of Shh signalling require Gli3 (Gene implicated in human Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome ) (Litingtung et al., 2002; Niswander, 2003). Gli3-/- embryos display polydactyly (which has been attributed to ectopic Shh expression in the early stage mesoderm of the anterior limb bud) and surprisingly Gli3-/- Shh-/- double mutants also have numerous digits with a normal stylopod and zeugopod. This suggests that the default state of the limb is to form many digits and that those 2 genes and their transcripts repress the polydactylous capacity of the autopod. In other words, Shh and Gli3 are required for digit identity, not the formation of the limb; and the type of digit that develops in a particular position depends on the signalling strength (Lintingtung et al., 2002; Niswander, 2003; Tickle, 2004). <picture/>The Gli3 processed form acts as a repressor (Gli3R) and the unprocessed form acts as an activator. The relative ratio of Gli3A: Gli3R is crucial in Shh signalling (Niswander, 2003; Litingtung et al., 2002). Defects in Shh signalling can be seen in talpid2 and talpid3 mutant which express high Gli3A:Gli3R levels across the anterior/posterior axis supporting the model described above (Tickle, 2004; Litintung et al., 2002). Upstream of Shh lie Hoxb8 and dHAND.Hoxb8, member of the Hox gene family, plays an important role in specifying the antero-posterior axis (Gilbert, 2003; Stratford et al., 1997). It appears to be induced by Retinoic acid (Retinal is oxidised to retinoic acid by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase2- Raldh2) as embryos treated with disulphiram (which inhibits RA synthesis) showed severe Hoxb8 down-regulation (Stratford et al., 1997) within particular regions of the forelimb mesoderm and is not detected in the hind limb. Conclusion, Hoxb8 only induces Shh in the anterior forelimb. Interestingly, grafting and removal experiments showed that Hoxb8 is inhibited by the established zone of polarizing activity and by the anterior AER (figure 10). <picture/>However, Shh signalling affects downstream targets as well. <heading>B) Downstream of Shh</heading>The vertebrate limb bud organizer patterns the anterior-posterior axis by generating differences through extracellular antagonism signalling (ZuÃ±iga et al., 1999). As stated, there is a feedback loop between the ZPA region and the AER in which Fgf-4 and Shh form the reciprocal regulation loop with Shh normally maintaining Fgf-4 expression which in turns maintains Shh expression in the posterior mesenchyme (Tickle, 2003). There are 3 main mediators of this feedback loop: Formin (Fmn), Gremlin (Gre) and Bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmp). Formin was first discovered as a downstream target of sonic hedgehog as in Shh mutants, there are no Fmn transcripts in the limb bud and in ld (limb deformity) mutant mice, the gene encoding Fmn is disrupted as well as the maintenance of the ridge and the Shh-Fgf feedback loop. Furthermore, anterior grafts of Shh expressing cells induce ectopic Formin expression in distal limb bud mesenchyme (ZuÃ±iga et al., 1999, Khokha et al., 2003). Downstream of Formin there is Gremlin, a member of the DAN/Cerberus gene family and an extracellular Bmp antagonist absolutely required in limb patterning (Khokha et al., 2003). This was demonstrated by producing a null allele at the Gremlin locus by replacing the open reading frame which lies in the exon with an in-frame fusion of LacZ to the sequence encoding the first five residues of Gremlin. Homozygous displayed a very obvious disturbed skeletal phenotype and died within 48hours of birth, Fgf-4 and Fgf-8 expression were reduced (they lacked kidneys, and as discussed, Fgf-8 is linked to embryonic kidney). This supports the model in which Gremlin is sufficient to induce the Fgf-Shh feedback loop (ZuÃ±iga et al., 1999, Khokha et al., 2003). Figure 11 is a model representing this regulation loop. However, there is an alternative pathway which involves the same protagonists, except for Shh, (and is therefore termed the Shh-independent pathway), with the instigator being an unknown posterior activity (ZuÃ±iga et al., 1999; Niswander, 2003). <figure/>This feedback loop shows that the making of a vertebrate limb involves cross-talking between the different axes. In contrast with the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment of the other axes, the formation of the dorso-ventral dimension appears to be straightforward. <heading>III) The mechanism of Dorso-ventral axis patterning</heading>Studies of the molecular control of the dorso-ventral patterning has so far identified 2 central characters. Wnt7a, a member of the Wnt family is expressed in the dorsal ectoderm, suggesting that it may play a role (Parr and McMahon, 1995; Riddle et al., 1995). Indeed, loss of Wnt7a function in mice, using gene targeting, results in the transformation of dorsal limb structures into ventral fates (Parr and McMahon, 1995; Riddle et al., 1995). These are particularly distinguishable in distal limb structures. In addition, ectopic expression of Wnt7a in ventral ectoderm leads to the acquisition of dorsal properties by the ventral mesoderm (Riddle et al., 1995). Figure 12 shows some of these penetrant phenotypes. <picture/>Wnt7a induces the expression of Lmx1 and is sufficient to maintain its expression in disto-dorsal mesenchymal cells. This is supported by the fact that expression of Wnt7a coincides with expression of Lmx1. Lmx1 is a member of the LIM homeobox gene family which encodes protein with a pain of cysteine-histidine rich LIM domains and a homedomain (Riddle et al., 1995). The presence or absence of their respective proteins appears to depict the organization of the limb into dorsal and ventral domains. In other words, the default state of the limb mesenchyme is ventral and Wnt7a and Lmx1 signalling result in the emergence of a dorsal pattern (Riddle et al., 1995). It follows that Wnt7a and Lmx1 signalling is not restricted to the dorso-ventral pattern. Indeed, the removal of the dorsal ectoderm or the loss of Wnt7a by gene targeting causes a reduction or loss of Shh expression. Moreover, loss of posterior skeletal elements and Fgf-4 expression in Wnt7a-/- limbs supports the view that Wnt7a is also required in conjunction with Fgfs to maintain Shh expression and thus A-P establishment (Niswander, 2003; Parr and McMahon, 1995; Riddle et al., 1995). Phenotypes produced by these experimental manipulations can be seen in figure 13. <picture/>Although a Wnt protein, Wnt7a is not involved in AER formation and does not have a Î²-catenin dependent activity (Kengaku et al., 1998). Misexpression of an activated mutant form of Î²-catenin limb buds stimulated the effect of Wnt3a but not of Wnt7a. Furthermore, this resulted in ectopic expression of Fgf-8 and other AER markers such as Fgf-4 and Bmp-2 but not Lmx1, the Wnt7a target (Kengaku et al., 1998). <figure/>What signal specifies the dorso-ventral border? It has yet to be identified but the dorso-ventral boundary can be clearly seen due to the presence of the apical ectodermal ridge (Rodriguez-Esteban et al., 1997). A gene called Radical fringe (R-fng) in the chick (it also homologous to Drosophila fng gene) appears to direct formation and positioning of the ridge (Rodriguez-Esteban et al., 1997). It is first expressed at the dorsal limb ectoderm and then at the dorso-ventral boundary to finally be expressed in the AER. <heading>Conclusion:</heading>The last ten years of research into this field has given insight into how all three axes are mutually linked to allow co-ordinated growth and patterning of the limb. Several aspects remain in the dark such as the fact that Gli3 activity is not required for expression of the genes downstream of Shh, however these genes are not sufficient to generate posterior digit identity (posterior pattern is not generated in the Gli3-/- limbs despite intact levels of Shh signalling as shown by expression of genes downstream of Shh). It is possible that another Gli family member fulfils this role or a different transcription factor. Another enigma is what are the downstream targets that translate the signals from the organizing centres into skeletal pattern? And the greatest question is why some of the molecules involved have been conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates whereas others have been changed within a specific developmental program? <table/>
