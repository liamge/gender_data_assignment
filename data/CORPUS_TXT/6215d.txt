<heading>Question 1 Forest Growth Rates</heading><heading>A forest has an extinction coefficient for solar radiation ( k ) of 0.5. Calculate the fraction of incoming solar radiation intercepted by the forest when the leaf area index ( L ) is 3.0 and when it is 6.0. </heading> FORMULA  <heading>Assuming that the radiation use efficiency (for intercepted solar radiation) of the forest is 2.0 g MJ-1, calculate the daily growth rates of the forest (g m-2 day-1) for both of the above values of leaf area index when the incoming solar radiation is either 15, 20 and </heading>25 MJ m-2 day-1.  FORMULA  <heading>Repeat the above calculations with k  reduced by 20% and with RUE  also reduced by 20%. You should calculate results for each combination of the parameters to give eight daily growth rates at each level of incoming solar radiation. </heading>By substituting all the different values of L, k, RUE and Rs into Equation 1, we have the following table of daily growth rates, rG: <table/><heading>Discuss the relative sensitivity of the changes in growth rate to the changes in k  and RUE , and how this depends on L  and incoming solar radiation. </heading>Let  FORMULA  be the relative sensitivity of the changes in growth rate, rG to the changes in k.  FORMULA  can be considered as the ratio of the changes in rG to the changes in k, when changes in k is small:  FORMULA  By substituting Equation 1 for rG:  FORMULA  When  FORMULA , in order to find the limit, we apply l'Hospital's Rule to Equation 2: l'Hospital's Rule:  FORMULA   FORMULA  This implies when L is small (very few leaf cover in the forest, i.e. at the beginning of growing season in a deciduous forest), the effect of changes in k on growth rate is comparable to the changes in k, but it becomes less significant when the forest become thicker and more leaves over lapping each other. The relationship between  FORMULA  and L are not linear (Figure 1). Also, incoming solar radiation, RS, has no effect on  FORMULA  <figure/> FORMULA As Equation 2 and Figure 1 model is for very small changes in k, 20% reduction in k is a rather large change. We can model this approximately by using the mean value of  FORMULA  when k is 0.5 and 0.4. From Equation 2, when L = 3.0,  FORMULA  Average of  FORMULA  and change in growth rate is:  FORMULA  From Table 1 data, when  FORMULA  change in growth rate =  FORMULA  Likewise, when L = 6.0, from Equation 2 the average of  FORMULA  is 0.1983 and this gives change in growth rate = - 0.0397, which is similar to the calculated result of - 0.0431 from Table 1 data. And these show predication from Equation 2 agrees with Table 1 data. Similarly, let  FORMULA  be the relative sensitivity of the changes in growth rate to the changes in RUE:  FORMULA  By substituting Equation 1 for rG:  FORMULA   FORMULA  This model shows growth rate, rG will follow the same changes in RUE. If RUE is decrease by 20%, growth rate will decrease by the same amount and this can be verify by data in Table 1. For example, from Table 1 data, when L = 3.0, k = 0.4, RUE = 2.0 and RUE = 1.6 and RS = 25: change in growth rate =  FORMULA  However, in an actual forest, RUE varies with changes in incoming solar radiation, RS. RUE is bigger if RS is small.  FORMULA  only holds, if RS remain the same. <heading>Question 2 Energy Balance of a Sheltered and Exposed Crops</heading><heading>a) what effects shelter has on the energy balance of the crop</heading>Shelter reduces wind speed and this lead to increase of aerodynamic resistance, ra and decreases both the rate of evapotranspiration, E and heat energy transfer from air to crop surface. As less energy is taken up by evapotranspiration in sheltered crops, this some time could reverse the direction of heat energy transfer between air and crop surface. This reversal of energy transfer direction effect can be seen on data from 15 July am, energy was taken from warm dry air for evapotranspiration in exposed crops whereas in sheltered crops, a faction of solar net radiation was transferred from crop surface to the air and very often this lead to higher air temperature in sheltered crops. Data on 14 July pm for sheltered crops were wrong, as they cannot be balanced in the energy balance equation:  FORMULA  (G can be ignored because of it was always less than 10 Wm -2.)  FORMULA  As data from the opened crops can be balanced by the energy balance equation, Rn = 502 Wm -2 was very likely to be correct. As the value of Rn was fairly high, 14 July pm could be a sunny period. From the data of other time and date, it seems that on sunny day, is usually around 30% less for sheltered crops than exposed crops and this seems to suggest  = 628 Wm -2 was probably correct. If value of  was 628 Wm -2, C should be around 126 Wm -2. <heading>b) any differences in energy balances between different days</heading>From the values of Rn, there seems to be sunny days (14 and 15 July) and overcast day (17 July). Values of E were higher in sunny days than in overcast day, also shelter had a bigger effect of reducing E in sunny day than in overcast day. In sunny day the air tended to be warmer and dryer, and substantial amount of energy from the air was transferred to the crops and taken up by E. In overcast day, much smaller amount of energy was transferred from air to crops and in the morning, energy was actually transferred from crops to air. <heading>c) whether the partitioning of energy differs between morning and afternoon</heading>On the whole, E was higher in the afternoon than in the morning, this was due to higher air temperature in the afternoon and more sensible heat was transferred from air to crops (values of C were more negative in the afternoon) and led to higher E. For each day calculate the water use of the crops totalled over the eight hour day. Express your answers in mm of water. Evapotranspiration energy of 1 mm of water: volume of water in 1 mm depth over 1m 2 area = (0.1 x 100 2) cm 3 = 1000 cm 3 As density of water = 1 g/cm 3, this gives: weight of water in 1 mm depth over 1 m 2 area = 1000 g Latent heat of water,  = 2450 J/g, this gives: energy to evaporate 1 mm depth of water over 1 m 2 area = (1000 x 2450) J = 2.45 MJ As E was mean values over period of 4 hours, value of conversion factor, c, which converses E in Wm -2 to cE mm of water is:  FORMULA  By multiplying c with values of E gives the following results: <table/>
