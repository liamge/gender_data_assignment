<abstract><heading>Summary</heading>The main objective of this lab is to model and analyse data obtained from physical tests conducted on a car tyre. At the same time as doing this I will be constantly increasing my proficiency in MATLAB. The lateral and longitudinal force was measured for varying values of slip angle and ratio respectively. We analysed these on a series of plots and used models to fit the trends. In doing this we explored MATLAB's capabilities and used many different functions. To conclude our results a linear model works only for values of slip angle <2.5degs and for slip ratios of <0.03. For values higher than this a non-linear model has to be used to get the exponential characteristics of the changes in lateral and longitudinal force. It is also possible to conclude that MATLAB is a very efficient program for problems involving data modelling and visualisation, providing an excellent basis for analysis. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>The aim of this laboratory is to use MATLAB to model the longitudinal and lateral force characteristics of a road tyre. The objectives of the laboratory are to: - <list>import longitudinal and lateral tyre force test data into the MATLAB workspace;visualise the tyre test data using MATLAB 1-D graphics tool;model the tyre test data in MATLAB using simple 1-D functions.A more general aim of the laboratory was to explore MATLAB and familiarise ourselves with the software and its functions. *1*</list>In a previous session we were introduced to MATLAB and shown some basic functions and the language used. This laboratory will extend this grounding and increase knowledge and familiarity. <heading>Theory</heading><picture/><picture/>These diagrams describe the longitudinal (traction/breaking) force F x and the lateral (cornering) force F y acting on a road tyre of radius r. The tyre has translational velocity v with longitudinal component v x and lateral component v y, and rotational speed . The slip angle , which determines the cornering force is given by  FORMULA  and the slip ratio s, which determines the traction/braking force is given by  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  F z is the vertical load on the tyre. *1* <picture/>As this diagram shows it is the deformation of the tyre as it turns a corner that causes it to take a slightly different path to the wheel. It is this difference in paths that generates the slip angle. This slip angle is dependant on many factors, including the inflation of the tyre. *2* <heading>Apparatus and Methods</heading>The tyre data was obtained from physical tests carried out on a standard car tyre using an industrial tyre test rig. The vertical force loaded was equivocal to a mass of 500kg. Lateral force measurements were made at zero slip ratio and with varying slip angles. Longitudinal force measurements were made at zero slip angle with varying slip ratios. It is these measurements which we will be visualising and analysing. *1* Names were given to each of the 4 sets of data for ease of use and accessibility. Using the software to visualise the data, plots of variation in lateral and longitudinal force with slip angle and slip ratio respectively. The data was then modelled with basic formulae. These models were then compared to actual results, to enable us to determine the best model. Linear and non-linear models were tested for both longitudinal and lateral force data. All plots were printed out for analysis and comparison. For a exact description of the method performed see appendix 7-11. <heading>Results</heading>For the results collected see graphs in appendix 1-6 <heading>Analysis and Discussion of Results</heading>See appendix 1-6 to refer to graphs. G1 is a graph of lateral force vs. slip angle. It is linear for values of slip angle between 0 and 2 degrees, however it then curves off in the shape of an exponential graph with an asymptote at about 4500N. G2 is a graph of longitudinal force vs. slip ratio. When the slip ratio is <0.03 then the results are linear. At values >0.03 then the results are again linear but with a reduced gradient. G3 shows a linear model with three different values of cornering stiffness. The model is represented by the equation F y = C + C p where is the slip angle and C is the cornering stiffness. 'a' represents the line when C = 1005Ndeg  - 1 and is the linear model which applies to the particular data used. The value of 1005Ndeg -1 is the gradient of the graph up to 2.5 deg. Different values for cornering stiffness were then modelled. 'b' represents 1200Ndeg  - 1 and 'c' represents 800Ndeg  - 1. The model itself is certainly accurate up to the 2deg point, however between 2 and 2.5deg it is hard to tell, as there are no results in this boundary. For values of slip angle >2.5 then this model is obviously inaccurate. G4 represents lateral force vs. slip angle using a non-linear model. It is effective for large slip angle values and is also reasonably good at estimating small angle values. However it has zero force at zero slip angle which is inaccurate as proved by the results. At small angles this model will give about 20% error. It curves off exponentially. G5 represents longitudinal force vs. slip ratio. It is another linear model, which applies only to small slip ratios <0.03. It is modelled by the equation F x = C ss + C q where C s = 121950N is the longitudinal stiffness and the best fit gradient <0.03 slip ratio. This is represented by line 'd'. Line 'e' represents Cs = 150000N and line 'f' represents Cs = 90000N. This model is very inaccurate for estimating longitudinal force for values of slip ratio above 0.03. G6 represents longitudinal force vs. slip ratio in a non-linear model. This is very useful for larger values of slip ratio but is also quite accurate for smaller values. Again it has zero force for zero slip ratio which is now a valid assumption if the results are correct. This model is quite inaccurate between 0.02 and 0.04 slip ratio. The results take a sharp corner here, which is hard to model. <heading>Recommendations </heading>When estimating the lateral and longitudinal forces in a practical situation like 'car safety when cornering' then it would be very important to use a model that gives an accurate estimate, one that can be used and built into the specifications of a car or tyre. I think that the non-linear models are really the only models that could be used in a practical sense. This is because slip angle or ratio has values that deviate and it would be hard to get these to stay under a particular value, as is necessary in the linear models. Also the non-linear models are accurate at the lower values as well, so they are the all-round performer. However more research is needed and more results need to be analysed before implementing one of these models in a practical situation. <heading>Conclusions</heading>From the results I can conclude that modeling is an effective way to estimate data. Although the data was small in quantity, models were still found that reproduced this data as a continuous function. It was found that when 0<slipangle<2.5 the linear model is most appropriate to find the lateral force. It was also found that if 0<slip ratio<0.3 then again a linear model is most appropriate to find the longitudinal force. It was also found that these linear models did not work beyond these values even to a reasonable degree. Non-linear models were then tested and it was found that these worked far better outside these boundaries and produced a comparable performance within them. Therefore for general use it can be concluded that the non-linear model is most accurate and efficient.
