<heading>2. 2. Describe the patterns of distribution of the allophones of /r/ , which are [ ] and [ ], and the allophones of /l/ , which are [l], [l] and [ɫ ] based on the data provided. What can you say about /r/ in syllable final position? </heading>The data indicates that the allophones of /r/: <list>1. appear in initial and medial positions but not in final position. 2. occur only before a vowel. 3. where the initial consonant is voiced [ ] occurs. For example, drain [d eɪn], and bray [b eɪ].4. where the initial consonant is voiceless [ ] occurs. For example, train [t eɪn] and pray [p eɪ].</list>The data indicates that the allophones of /l/: <list>1. occur in initial, medial, and final positions. 2. when /l/ follows /p/ or /k/ it becomes voiceless [l], for example, play [pleɪ], clear [klɪə], and occlude [əkluˑd]. 3. The other two allophones of /l/ can be said to be in complementary distribution because:</list>[l]always appears before a vowel and never before a consonant, for example lay [leɪ],glue[glu],delay [dɪlei],and leer [lɪə],and [ɫ]never occurs before a vowel. For example bell [beɫ]andfold [fɒʊɫd]. The data indicates that /r/ in syllable final position is not pronounced. For example, leer [lɪə],and clear [klɪə]. <heading>3. 3. Meltese and Leponese have identical phonetic inventories, but different phonological inventories. Give the phonetic inventory the two languages share, and then the phonological vowel inventory for each language. Indicate the line of reasoning which led to your answer.</heading>Meltese and Leponese share the phonetic consonant inventory [t l p] and the phonetic vowel inventory [u e i ʊɛɪ]Their phonological vowel inventories differ in the following ways. <heading>Meltese. </heading>[u] occurs only in final position and only after [t]. [ʊ] occurs only between consonants and only after [t]. [i] occurs only in final position and only after[p] or [t]. [ɪ] occurs only between consonants and only after[p] or [l]. [e] occurs only in final position and after any consonant. [ɛ] occurs only between consonants and only after [p] or [l]. Each pair shows complementary distribution with its partner as the first item in each pair occurs only in final position and the second occurs only between consonants. This suggests that [u] and [ʊ] are allophones of the same phoneme as are [e] and [ɛ], and [i] and [ɪ]. Their sound will change depending on their position and which consonant they follow. The monosyllables [tu] vine and [ti] leaf show us that [u] and [i] contrast in identical environments and so are separate phonemes. They are a minimal pair because they change the meaning of the word. 4. As [e]occurs in final position it can occur in a monosyllable, eg: [le] another, and [pe] mirage, but [ɛ] cannot because it must occur between two consonants. Words are not restricted to a consonant/vowel (CV) pattern but may also occur as a CVCCV pattern, eg; [tʊlpe]milk. Therefore the phonological inventory of Meltese is [u e i] <heading>Leponese. </heading>[e] and [ɛ] occur in the same positions within a word, either final or in second position and, as they change the meaning of the words in which they occur, they are a minimal pair. For example, [lepɪ] rabbit and [lɛpɪ] grandmother, [pʊle] air and [pʊlɛ] fence. This feature occurs with [u] and [ʊ]. They also occur in final or second position and are a minimal pair changing the meaning of a word. For example, [pʊlɛ] fence, and [pulɛ] ant. [i] and [ɪ] show this feature in the monosyllables [ti] baby, and [tɪ] tree. Together they make up a minimal set. Any vowel can appear in final position. All words follow a consonant/vowel (CV) pattern. Therefore the phonological inventory of Leponese is [u e i ʊɛɪ] <heading>5. 4. Which spectrogram matches which phrase, and which features of the spectrograms led to this decision?</heading><heading>a. </heading>In each spectrogram the vowels sounds /ə/ and /ɪ/ are shown by the formants which correspond to the change of shape in the vocal tract required to produce them. Spectrograms 1 and 3 must be a tip and a dip because the /t/ and the /d/ are stops and this is indicated by the clear space. Subsequently spectrograms 2 and 4 must be a sip and a zip. Therefore; Spectrogram 1 is  a dip. /ədɪp/ /d/ is a voiced alveolar plosive. The voicing of the vowel sound /ə/ continues in the voiced /d/ making the vowel sound /ə/ longer than in spectrogram 3. The voicing in the /ɪ/ is stopped in preparing to form the voiceless /p/ making the /ɪ/ shorten, while not shortening it as much as is needed in spectrogram 3 where both consonants are voiceless. The voicing bar at the bottom also indicates this is the voiced plosive. Spectrogram 3 is  a tip. /ətɪp/ /t/ is a voiceless alveolar plosive. The voicing of the vowel sound /ə/ is shorter than in spectrogram 1 in preparation for the following voiceless /t/. The /ɪ/ is also shorter in preparation for the voiceless bilabial /p/. The lack of a voicing bar at the bottom also indicates this is the voiceless plosive. 6. Spectrogram 2 is  a sip. /əsɪp/ The burst of very high energy shows this is a fricative and the lack of a voicing bar tells us it is the voiceless fricative /s/. The voicing of the vowel sound /ə/ is shortened in preparation for the following voiceless /s/. The /ɪ/ remains short in preparation for the voiceless bilabial /p/. Spectrogram 4 is a zip. /əzɪp/ As with /s/ there is a burst of very high energy but the presence of the voicing bar tells us it is voiced and so is the sound /z/. The voicing of the vowel sound /ə/ continues in the voiced /z/ making the vowel sound /ə/ lengthen. The voicing in the /ɪ/ is stopped in preparing to form the voiceless /p/ making the /ɪ/ shorten. <heading>b. </heading>The line that appears at the end of each spectrogram represents the release of the voiceless bilabial plosive /p/.
