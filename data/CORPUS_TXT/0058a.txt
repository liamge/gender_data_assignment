It is not influenced by outliers as the mean is. For example if we had a very high value such as £200 this would increase the mean greatly so that it is no longer as representative of the sample as the median. The mode is of a varying degree of usefulness - it tells us the most common value but here this is very low and not representative of the sample values as a whole. If we look at various major peaks in the data set then this is a fairly useful tool. For example, here the data is bimodal - there is a split between people carrying a relatively large amount of money and a small amount. By themselves the mean, mode and median are of varying degrees of usefulness however, together they form powerful statistics for analysis, Sample Mean value group 1 = £12.42 Sample Mean value group 2 = £6.95 Sample Mean value group 3 = £19.48 Sample Mean value group 4 = £10.18 Sample Mean value group 5= £13.36 Sample Mean value group 6= £11.97 Stem and leaf of set of means: Stem: 10's leafs:units split x5-9 .0- 4 <table/>x is 5-9 of below <figure/>As both the stem and leaf and the scatter diagram show, the set of means shows sampling variability, for example the mean of group two is £6.95 whilst the mean of group 3 is closer to £20 - if we took each of these sample means by themselves as representative of the whole population of students in the class they perhaps would not be representative. However, many of the means of each sample set fall between £10 and £14 and this corresponds with the mean of the total population of students in Stat Lab. <heading>d)</heading>i) It is not reasonable to consider this sample as representative of any population as:e/lln The sample is not random for any population e.g. every experimental unit is a first year student at  University and this is in no way representative of (for example) the population of England or even the population of students at  University. The sample is biased. The sample size is very small - only 27 units. We need to take a larger sample size to reduce sampling variability. ii) Each group is fairly representative of the 'population' students in the room, as long as each experimental unit in each sample is selected at random from the population. However, the sample size is still quite small (4) which means sampling variability is still high. iii) The reported data are not a very accurate representation of how much money is owned by students in total as the money that people carry is not representative of how much they own in total. Some people may never carry money around/ only carry a very small amount as they usually use credit/ debit card as a form of payment and some people may be carrying a lot of money around as they need to make a particular payment with it. iv) This information may be able to be used to answer the question of how much money students at  carry round with them on campus - this may be used, for example, to help businesses on campus work out prices of their products which are usually impulsive buys. However the sample is still not random as people who are maybe friends or people with similar academic interests attend stat lab and so is not representative. To improve the design of the study of how much money students at  University own a better sample must first be chosen. For example, people of different years, academic disciplines, nationalities and interests must be included to gain a better representation of the student body as a whole. In addition, the amount of money that people carry with them is not a good variable to use to test the amount of money people own. A different variable such as (although intrusive) the amount of money people have in their bank accounts would be more useful to test.
