The model is derived used linear elastic theory. The general beam equation is: 1.

FORMULA  Integrating equation 3 twice gives us a working model for vertical deflection of a simply supported beam. <heading>Maximum displacement</heading>The formula above calculates only the maximum displacement. This assumes a sinusoidal deformation. In reality, if the load is applied offset from the centre of the beam, then the maximum displacement occurs close to the centre, but towards the direction of the load. The following formula calculates where maximum displacement will be: Maximum displacement: 5.  FORMULA  occurs at a distance of c from 'A': 6.

A simply supported beam with a knife edge support at either end, a sliding adjustable mass, and sliding displacement gauge were used: The mass slider was placed at specific distances from 'A' along the beam. The displacement gauge was also placed at specific distances from 'A' for each of the positions of the mass slider. The masses were used for each of the following combinations: <table/>The masses used were 0.5 and 1.0 Kg. The displacement was then recorded for each of the above combinations. <heading>Cantilevered Shaft</heading>A lever arm was clamped onto the free end of a cantilevered tube, fixed at the other end into a wooden frame. The lever arm was first distanced from the fixed end of the tube by 200 mm, and later repeated at 100 mm. An adjustable mass was then hung on the lever arm, firstly 200 mm from the centre of the tube, and then repeated again at 100 mm. <picture/>The total displacement was recorded by using a height gauge, and measuring at the free end of the lever arm. This was recorded before and after load was applied, the change being the total deflection. As explained in the theory, this is not the deflection due to the torque of the tube. To isolate this, the mass was also hung from the free end of the tube, and the displacement measured. The deflection due to the tube bending was then be deducted from the total deflection. The same principle was applied to negate the deflection due to the lever arm bending. The mass was hung from the lever arm, whilst the lever arm was fixed to the tube at the fixed end. This eliminated torsion in the tube as the4 length of tube under load was negligible. The deflection due to the bending of the lever arm was then deducted too, leaving the deflection due entirely to the torque applied to the tube remaining. <heading>Observations and Results</heading>The results of the simply supported beam are displayed in Table 1, whilst the cantilevered beam results are displayed in Tables 2 and 3. The models proved to be so inaccurate that estimations could not be made rendering the models useless. <heading>Analysis of Results</heading>The mathematical models proved useless, and estimations could not be made. The second set of results taken from the cantilevered beam is plotted in Graph 1, and shows a good linear relationship. Errors in the results are great. <list><heading> Bending</heading>Placement of the mass and displacement gauge +/- 5 mmReading of displacement +/- 0.01 mm</list><list><heading>Torsion</heading>Slipping of the lever arm on the tubeReading and using the height gaugeBending of the lever arm and the tube, though this been reduced by taking further experiments to subtract their deformation from the total displacement.Position of load and lever arm +/- 5 mm</list><heading>Conclusions</heading>The deformation of simply supported beams, and of cantilevered hollow shafts depends upon many variables. This proved difficult when devising mathematical models. The models proved too difficult, the behaviour of the deformations backed up the theory of linear deformation. Variables include the geometry of the beam, the material and many more dimensions.
