Patients with asthma have airway hyper responsiveness which is exacerbated by certain triggers such as cold air, viral infections, drugs etc. The recent viral illness that  has had may have exacerbated the hyper responsiveness in the airways triggering her asthma attack. The fact that her symptoms were not relieved by her normal inhalers would indicate that this is a severe attack of asthma. Other possible diagnoses which should be excluded at this stage include: Pulmonary Embolism -  has no risk factors for the development of a PE (e.g. obesity, Oral contraceptive pill, post surgery, smoking etc) and did not report any haemoptysis or dizziness. There was associated chest pain but this was a constant tightness rather than a sharp pleuritic pain as seen with a PE. Investigations for suspected PE: Presence of D-Dimer in blood - no specific for PE but if absent excludes PE as a differential V-Q perfusion scan - to assess ventilation perfusion mismatch CT pulmonary angiography - to assess blood flow throughout lungs Pneumothorax - Pneumothorax can occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma. There was no history of trauma to the chest in this patient. A rare cause of a pneumothorax is asthma, patients often present with sudden onset of pleuritic pain and progressively increasing breathlessness. Physical examination may not reveal any further symptoms and this differential is excluded by chest x-ray. Anaphylaxis - There was no report of a direct precipitant to the attack of shortness of breath in the hours preceding the attack e.g. drugs, latex etc. In an acute presentation of shortness of breath, signs to look for on examination include - swelling/oedema of the tongue and lips, tachycardia and hypotension. At presentation  displayed signs of wheezing and shortness of breath, which are also associated with an anaphylactoid reaction. Upper respiratory tract obstruction - This can occur due to inhalation of a foreign body, the patient may present with stridor, localised or generalised wheezing. This is an important differential as many patients may not even recall the aspirating event [1]. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading><heading>Examination on admission  (taken from notes)</heading><list>Pulse - 105 tachycardicSaturation - 95% on airRespiratory Rate - 22 pmTemperature 37.5 CBlood Pressure 110/65</list> was distressed and anxious on admission, she was dyspnoeic and was unable to talk in sentences.

These signs indicate that 's asthma attack was severe based on: <list>Unable to talk in complete sentencesRR > 25/minHR > 110/minPeak expiratory flow rate <50% of predicted or best</list><heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>Physically -  did not appear to be dyspnoeic at the time of examination but appeared to be quite lethargic, this is likely to be a result of the acute asthma attack and her recent chest infection. It is therefore important that her energy/nutrition levels are maintained to promote her recovery. During management of an acute asthma attack it is important to monitor the patients pO2 and pCO2 levels to recognise the need for ventilation. Psychologically -  was frightened by the asthma attack and appeared to be anxious on examination.  is not normally affected by her asthma and only uses her ventolin inhaler approx 2-3 time/week. This episode distressed her and she is concerned hat she will be unable to control her asthma on discharge from hospital.  does not remember much about her state at the time of admission and this may be one of the reasons for her distress. Socially -  social activities are not greatly limited by her asthma as it is usually well controlled with her inhalers.  may need to limit her physical activity over the next few weeks until she has recovered from the chest infection.  should be advised on ways of limiting her exposure to triggers of her asthma at home by e.g. using an anti allergy mattress, ensuing her living space is dust free. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management.

To monitor the patients blood pH, pO2 and pCO2. Patients who are short of breath are unable to breathe in sufficient amounts of Oxygen and so there pO2 levels fall. In order to increase their oxygen intake they begin to hyperventilate, which can also result in a fall in their pCO2. As the respiratory drive is usually increased during asthma exacerbations, a normal pCO2 indicates severe airflow obstruction and an increased risk of respiratory failure [2]. If the asthma attack is prolonged, the patient can tire and their muscles of respiration are unable to maintain the increased respiratory rate. The pCO2 levels begin to rise and can result in hypercapnia which may require the patient to be ventilated. Life threatening attack is indicated by: <list>High PCO2 >6 kPaPO2 < 8 kPaLow and falling arterial pH</list>Blood gases should be repeated within 2 hours if: <list>The patient is deterioratingInitial pCO2 was normal/raisedInitial pO2 < 8 kPa</list><heading>Sputum sample</heading>Why?

Report: Right basal shadowing <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading>, the reason that you were admitted to hospital last night was because you had a severe asthma attack which you were unable to relieve with your own inhalers. Your chest x-ray shows that you have some shadows on the base of your right lung, which fit with your recent chest infection, and this was probably the trigger to your asthma attack. We gave you some oxygen and medication to help open up your airways so that it was easier for you to breathe. We kept you in overnight so that we could monitor your blood tests, respiratory rate and the amount of oxygen you were breathing. As you know your asthma can be triggered by a number of things, therefore it is important that you avoid smoking and any animals that you are allergic to. You should also try to keep your room clean to reduce the number of dust mites and could try using an anti allergy mattress on your bed. Before you are discharged from the hospital, I would like to watch you using your inhaler so that we can be sure you are getting the maximum benefit from it, I will also provide you with some leaflets which explain how each of your inhalers works.

Hypoxemia is produced by ventilation perfusion mismatch and so administration of inspired oxygen can usually correct this. Historically the use of high flow oxygen delivered by a mask and reservoir bag has been considered the best way of delivering oxygen to patients with an acute asthma attack. However recent studies have shown that hyperoxia may be unsafe for some patients as it can worsen the patients paCO2. One RCT compared the effect of 2 oxygen concentrations on gas exchange in adult patients with severe acute asthma. The study concluded that administration of 100% oxygen for 20 minutes significantly increased paCO2 and decreased PEFR compared with administration of 27% oxygen [3]. The oxygen dose prescribed in severe acute asthma attacks should therefore be variable and based on achieving and maintaining an spO2 of 92% adults and 95% children using pulse oximetry [3]. Bronchodilators (2 agonists) are used for the relief of the symptoms of asthma. Additional Aminophylline ahs also been sued in conjunction with B2 agonists but its role in additional benefit has been unclear. Indeed one review found that in acute asthma the use of Aminophylline did not result in any additional bronchodilation compared to standard care with Beta agonists [4]. Many patients who are admitted to hospital with acute asthma are often prescribed antibiotics incase the cause of the exacerbation is a bacterial infection. However the cost, side effects and allergy risk associated with antibiotics call into question whether they should be prescribed in acute asthma. One systematic review found that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the case of acute asthma [5]. More research is required in this area to provide evidence on the efficacy of antibiotics in patients with acute asthma. Corticosteroids are used routinely in the management of acute asthma although the route of administration remains controversial. Oral corticosteroids are easier to administer than IV and are potentially safer than IV corticosteroids although they take longer to reach therapeutic levels. However a research ahs shown that corticosteroids administered orally and IV had similar efficacy in the treatment of adults hospitalised with acute asthma [6]. Patient education plays a vital role in the prevention of exacerbations of asthma. Indeed one systematic review found that educating patients how to self manage their asthma reduced hospital admissions, unscheduled visits to the GP and days off work [7]. A written individualised action plan enable the patient to adjust there medication in response to particular symptoms and signs. Such strategy avoids delays, prevents exacerbations and adds to the patient's sense of control over their asthma [2]. <heading>Chronic asthma</heading>IgE plays a central role in the development of allergic diseases. People with allergies produce IgE when exposed to allergens, this causes a release of chemicals such as histamine that produce the symptoms associated with allergic diseases e.g. itching, sneezing, shortness of breath and cough. Recombinant monoclonal antibodies to IgE may play a role in the treatment of allergic diseases such as asthma. Indeed one review found that anti IgE led to a reduction in asthma exacerbations and in some cases withdrawal of regular inhaled steroid use [8]. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>The prevalence of asthma is increasing worldwide with approximately 10% of people having suffered an asthma attack [9]. Exposure to certain stimuli produces inflammation and structural changes in the airways resulting in airway hyper responsiveness and obstruction to airflow. The aim of intervention is to: minimise or eliminate symptoms maximise lung function, prevent exacerbations minimise the need for medication facilitate self-management of asthma Many asthmatics do not use their inhalers correctly resulting in only 10% of the medication actually reaching the patients airways. It is therefore vital that a patients inhaler technique is observed to ensure that they are gaining maximum benefit from it and to prevent their asthma treatment being inappropriately stepped up to include steroid use. Upper respiratory tract infections and exposure to allergens are thought to be the most common triggers of severe asthma exacerbations. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading><list>Management of acute asthma attackStepwise treatment of asthma:</list><list>Relief bronchodilators - short acting agonist e.g. SalbutamolStep 1 plus Preventer - regular inhaled steroid e.g. Beclometasone (Becotide)Step 1 + high dose inhaled steroid or long acting agonist e.g. SalmeterolHigh does inhaled steroid + long acting agonist + other bronchodilators e.g. TheophyllineStep 4 + regular oral steroid e.g. Prednisolone</list><list>Differential diagnoses for a patient presenting with shortness of breathIndications for ITU referral in severe asthma attack</list>
