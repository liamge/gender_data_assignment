Dyspnoea was at its worst last night () so that by presentation at A+E at 4am on the  she was gasping for breath. Dyspnoea was described as 'not being able to catch my breath, I was gasping' with associated chest tightness. This presenting episode of dyspnoea came on suddenly on the  and has progressed in severity since. It was variable in nature i.e. 'came and went' limiting her ability to manage the single flight of stairs in her home and to generally move around the house. Her dyspnoea was unresponsive to either her regular nebulised or inhaled medication but was said to improve following administration of salbutamol 5mg, atrovent 500mg and IV hydrocortisone 200g in A+E. Despite having had asthma for 37 years, her exercise tolerance is usually reasonable. She regularly uses a nebuliser and is usually able to manage stairs at home without any difficulty. Over the past few days prior to admission she has experienced progressive difficulty managing this same flight of stairs. Her breathlessness also has impaired her ability to dress and wash herself. Her dyspnoea was exacerbated by physical exertion, emotional upset or stress. She generally has reasonable control of her asthma. Her last asthma attack requiring hospitalisation was in . Her asthma is worst in the mornings on waking and this has been especially so over the last week. To 'get going' in the mornings she had to take her 'drugs' on waking and then wait about half an hour until she felt sufficiently less breathless to get up and walk. This was unachievable on the 2 days prior to admission. Cigarette smoke, aerosol sprays, cats and dogs exacerbate her asthma. She becomes wheezier when she is ill with a cold or similar and wonders if her current cough is associated with her breathlessness. She has not yet had a flu vaccination this year. Her chest has over the 3 days prior to admission woken her at night when she was aware of being 'breathy and gasping for breath'. This is however, not a regular occurrence. She sleeps currently with a single pillow and has done for many years. Breathlessness at night was relieved slightly using her inhaler and reading (relaxing). Associated with her progressive breathlessness was a cough. She was unable to catch her breath sufficiently to be able to cough up much in the way of secretions. What was brought up was cloudy in colour. There was no associated pain, phlegm, haemoptysis, nausea, vomiting or sweating. She complained of feeling 'unwell' in the 2 days prior to admission describing feelings of fatigue, headache and 'generally not feeling herself'. She was also currently aware of her hands shaking. <heading>Systems Review: </heading>No other significant signs or symptoms associated with other major systems.

She has 2 adult children and is retired having been a housewife for many years. She has some paid help with cleaning the house but otherwise is independent around the house when well. She requires assistance washing and dressing when particularly wheezy or when recovering from an asthma attack and will continue to receive this from her husband on discharge. She has never owned pets. She is a non-smoker and drinks no alcohol. She thought herself that this was an exacerbation of the longstanding asthma, which she experiences. She was anxious to become less breathless so that she may feel more comfortable and was keen to return home as rapidly as possible. <heading>Analysis of history The most likely single cause of the presentation, other possible causes and reasons for these choices. The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>Given 's long-standing history of asthma, the most likely cause of her current presenting symptoms is an acute exacerbation of her asthma. Dyspnoea was relatively acute in onset and variable in nature ruling out obstructive causes such as malignancy. Asthma is a common inflammatory condition of the airways, characterised by 3 pathological processes: airflow limitation - usually reversible spontaneously or with treatment airway hyperresponsiveness - to a wide range of stimuli e.g. cold air, exercise, emotions. bronchial inflammation - involves mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. Inflammation results in remodelling of both bronchiolar structure and function. This remodelling in addition to alteration in smooth muscle contractility causes bronchial hyperresponsivity. Remodelling is achieved by a number of factors, (i) epithelium of conducting airways is damaged with loss of ciliated columnar cells onto the lumen, (ii) thickened basement membrane, (iii) hyperplasia of the helical bands of airways smooth muscle, (iv) central and peripheral neural reflexes contribute to enhancing airway irritability. Symptoms, which may be found, include cough, wheeze, chest tightness and shortness of breath.  presents with all these. Her asthma is on occasions worse at night as can often be the case. Asthmatic individuals may demonstrate symptoms of airflow limitation almost identical to those of COPD. These are cough, wheeze, breathlessness and tachypnoea. Dyspnoea in asthma is typically intermittent and variable in nature, which contrasts with the constant dyspnoea seen in COPD. Findings to be looked for on physical examination include tachypnoea, an audible wheeze, hyperinflated chest, hyperresonant percussion, decreased air entry and widespread, polyphonic wheeze. Differential diagnosis for 's dyspnoea: Pulmonary oedema - unlikely as although presents with acute dyspnoea and wheezing does not have a cough producing characteristic frothy, blood tinged sputum. There is no indication of peripheral circulatory shutdown from the history either. Large airway obstruction e.g. tumour - unlikely, dyspnoea had relatively acute onset and variable nature. Pneumothorax - does present with progressively increasing breathlessness as here but there is no associated unilateral pleuritic pain as would be expected. Look for tracheal and mediastinal shift. Superior vena cava obstruction - unlikely no indication of venous congestion or stridor. Bronchiectasis - no production of yellow/green sputum. Does present with malaise however. <heading>Physical and mental state examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading>An elderly lady who appeared comfortable when sitting and non-septic.

Findings on examination that support this diagnosis are: Tachypnoea - respiratory rate > 25 breaths per minute Tachycardia - > 110 bpm PEFR < 50% of predicted normal or best Inability to complete sentences on presentation at A+E An audible wheeze, hyperinflated chest and decreased air entry. Hyperinflation of the chest is seen in states of chronic airflow limitation such as chronic asthma. Absence of cyanosis at presentation at A+E - important as cyanosis is a feature of a life-threatening attack. Her dyspnoea was acute in onset and then worsened progressively in severity. Dyspnoea was variable in nature. The presenting cough is a frequent symptom associated with asthma. It can commonly be misdiagnosed as bronchitis, careful investigation is required for clarification. The tremor observed in the patient's hands and fingers is most likely caused by stimulation of β receptors in skeletal muscle by bronchodilator drugs e.g. Salbutamol. It can be distinguished from CO 2 retention as found in chronic airflow limitation by absence of warm peripheries, bounding pulses or headache. Asthma can be divided into extrinsic (atopic) or intrinsic types. Asthma is an atopic disorder, which may run in families as is the case for . Atopic individuals (30-40% of the UK population) have IgE antibodies against common environmental materials. Association between serum IgE level, prevalence of asthma and airway responsiveness to histamine and methacholine has been shown. Inhalation of an allergen in an atopic individual such as , compounded by a possible concomitant respiratory infection will have led to the following reactive process. Immediate asthma (early reaction) - airflow limitation occurs within minutes of exposure, reaches max. within 15-20 minutes and can subside within an hour. ↓ Late phase reaction -  developed a more prolonged and sustained airflow limitation which was unresponsive to her regular bronchodilator medication ↓ Late phase reaction associated with increase in airway hyperreactivity causing  to experience episodes of asthma on subsequent days as seen. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>Physical-:  suffers with chronic asthma, which presents with acute episodes several times a year.

She also has osteoporosis and is concerned that she may incur fractures with little or no precipitating trauma. Psychological-: She is highly intelligent and expressive and finds it hard to accept her current physical ability and independence do not match her level of mental independence.

Refer to the guidelines to the writing of portfolio cases for the details of the issues to be addressed under each heading.</heading><heading>Investigations</heading><table/>The raised D-dimer does warrant further investigation with doppler ultrasound to exclude deep vein thrombosis as a cause for the presenting symptoms. Various factors including respiratory infection may contribute however, to raise D-dimer level. <table/>Raised CRP indicates presence of systemic infection. LFT results were all within the normal range. <table/>A respiratory alkalosis caused by 's hyperventilation is indicated. Removal of CO 2 from the body is excessive, decreasing arterial pCO 2 below 5.3kPa. This leads to both a decrease in [H+] and [HCO 3]. The decreased pCO 2 and [H+] in renal tubule cells reduces rate of H+ secretion; so that although plasma [HCO 3] is reduced thus reducing the amount filtered by the kidney; rate of H+ secretion is insufficient to reabsorb all the filtered bicarbonate. HCO 3 is therefore excreted in the urine and plasma [HCO 3] falls further. Chest X-ray (PA view)  - evidence of old rib fracture. Thickened pleura. No consolidation seen ruling out pneumonia. No evidence of pneumothorax. ECG  - sinus tachycardia. Sputum tests - look for raised eosinophils. <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading>The breathlessness you are currently experiencing is due to an acute exacerbation of your asthma. Your asthma attack bringing you to hospital this time may well have been triggered by a chest infection, which you have picked up, and we will treat this whilst you are an inpatient. Whilst in hospital we will look at and perhaps modify your medication in order to optimise control of your asthma for the winter. The chest physicians will then continue your care on hospital discharge. By decreasing your breathlessness, we aim to significantly improve your mobility and level of independence. We will consider discharge when your breathlessness is reduced, your peak flow is back to your normal levels and your cough has gone.

Features of a life-threatening asthma attack are silent chest, cyanosis, exhaustion, confusion or coma, bradycardia or hypotension and a PEFR < 30% of the predicted normal or best approx. 150L in adults. She is reasonably nourished and hydrated and unlikely to require supplementation during her hospital stay. She should ideally be kept in hospital for a minimum of 5 days as the majority of deaths occur 2-5 days after admission. Regular oxygen saturation should be monitored by oximetry. Reduction in prednisolone should be performed gradually with substitution by an inhaled corticosteroid preparation. A synthaxin test may be required on steroid withdrawal to assess adrenal function. <heading>Referral and team working</heading><list>Respiratory and general physiciansAsthma nurse and clinic servicesGP - follow up care and support on hospital discharge</list><heading>Advice and Prevention</heading>Reduce allergens in home - wash bedding and carpets regularly to avoid dust mites Humidifier at home Avoid contact with pets Increase consumption of dairy products, calcium rich foods e.g. spinach Mild weight bearing exercise when asthma permits Hip protectors/Good shoes and slippers to minimise likelihood of falls <heading>Outcome A description of the progress of the patient as far as possible.

Peak flow rate varies considerably between individuals with sex, age and height. PEFR measures expiratory flow in the first 2ms of expiration only, overestimating lung function in individuals with moderate airflow limitation. PEFR is best used therefore to monitor disease progression and its treatment rather than airflow limitation. Clearly, peak flow needs to be restored towards her normal levels prior to discharge to optimise prognosis. At the ward round on the same day, she was comfortable and feeling 'better than when she first came in'. CRP was less than 10mg/L indicating resolution of infection. <heading>Evidence based care and issues for research A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s)</heading>The evidence base for the management of asthma is vast. As  is presenting with an acute exacerbation of her asthma, I have chosen to focus as such on this aspect here. Aims of treatment for  are to (i) minimise or eliminate symptoms, (ii) maximise lung function, (iii) prevent further exacerbations, (iv) minimise side-effects associated with medication and (v) provide sufficient information to enable her to manage her asthma effectively herself. Concerning the management of acute asthma: Inhaled corticosteroids: systematic review evidence has shown that inhaled corticosteroids administered in A+E significantly reduce admission rates when compared to placebo 1. No significant difference was found between the efficacy of inhaled plus oral corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid in either the same setting or in preventing relapse within a 24-day period. Short acting β2 agonists: hospital admission rates have been shown in systematic reviews to be equally affected by both continuous and intermittent short acting β2 agonists when delivered via a nebuliser 2. Intravenous administration has also been shown to have no significantly different effect on either hospital admission rates or peak expiratory flow readings. Ipratropium bromide: the addition of Ipratropium bromide to a β2 agonist such as salbutamol significantly improves FEV 1 over a period of 90 minutes compared to salbutamol alone and in addition significantly reduces hospital admission rates 3. This data can only be supported by 2 further randomised controlled trials, as these were the only ones, which reported their data in sufficient detail to be included in analysis of hospital admission rates. This is certainly an area to be addressed in future clinical research. Areas for future research also include the use of oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation in the management of acute asthma as there is no published randomised controlled trial evidence concerning this. Specialist versus generalist care: limited evidence suggests that outcomes in those individuals with severe asthma may be improved with specialist rather than generalised care. Parameters measuring improvement include number waking at night, those suffering relapse requiring emergency hospital admission within 6 months and the number suffering multiple relapses. These same individuals were however more likely to receive inhales corticosteroids and sodium cromoglycate. Mortality in medical intensive care units is higher than in general care but accounts for less than 3% of hospital admissions 4. Education: facilitating disease self-management by providing specialist education concerning asthma has been found by a number of randomised controlled trials to reduce further hospital admission rates, doctors appointments (excluding those which are routine) and days off work through illness 5. This has interesting implications for future delivery of healthcare. Reduced admission rates and appointments will help alleviate current financial and resource stresses in the NHS. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>Asthma is extremely common and causes considerable morbidity. Prevalence is increasing in the UK particularly in the 2 nd decade of life where between 10-15% of the population are affected 6. Various stimuli either cause or trigger asthma: <list>Environmental exposure to an allergen e.g. domestic pollen, domestic petsOccupational sensitizers - isocyanates, colophony fumesAltmopsheric pollution - sulphur dioxide, ozone, particulate matterDrugs - NSAIDs, β-adrenoceptor antagonistsViral infections - Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza virus, RSVCold airEmotionIrritant dusts, vapour and fumes</list>Clearly, in this case the presenting exacerbation of asthma required secondary specialist hospital based care. Chronic, stable asthma can however be effectively managed in the community/primary care setting incorporating a multidisciplinary led team care approach.  is greatly concerned and anxious about her asthma and the prospect of having further attacks. Manipulation of her treatment regime in order to minimise the risk of these attacks occurring must be explained to her in a format she is able to understand and absorb. As well as optimising disease control by modifying pharmacotherapy, interventions such as controlling extrinsic factors e.g. dust mites and particular drugs and educating affected individuals and their families can help optimise health outcome and prognosis. Facilitating the self-management of asthma has diffuse future healthcare implications. For example, patient care and healthcare experience could be optimised, helping a patient 'take ownership' of their disease e.g. taking peak flow readings can help with acceptance of a chronic disease and resource strains on the NHS alleviated. Relapse rate from acute exacerbations of asthma varies between 7-15% depending on how aggressively the patient is treated. Current therapeutic regimens comprising ipratropium, corticosteroids and β2 selective agonists demonstrate suboptimal efficacy. Long-term prognosis following severe, life-threatening attacks is poor, mortality may reach 10%. Clearly, this is an area to address with future research 7. This case demonstrates ethical controversy inherent with the treatment of chronic diseases such as asthma. Clearly, for  the use of steroid treatment when required in both her acute management and for longer term purposes to achieve maintenance is life saving. However, this same treatment has decreased her bone density causing osteoporosis. She demonstrates radiological evidence of an associated pathological fracture in her ribs largely contributed to by this drug-induced osteoporosis. This highlights the need for continuing future research into optimising drug treatments for asthma. Morbidity and mortality associated with asthma increases with socioeconomic deprivation and ethnicity. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading><list>Exacerbating factors of asthmaFactors determining prognosisThe importance of a multi-disciplinary team in patient careManagement of both chronic and acute episodes of asthmaImpact of diagnosis of an acute illnessBiopsychosocial model of health</list>
