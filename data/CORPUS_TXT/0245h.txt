He was unaware of having had a mole in the same position prior to this time but could remember being severely sunburnt over "the back and shoulders as a child". Over the 3 years prior to presentation on the  this mole had been progressively increasing in size approxiamtely doubling from 0.5cm x 0.5cm to 1cm x 1cm. In addition, the mole was spontaneously bleeding with frequency of 4/5 times a week. This again had worsened in the year prior to presentation. Bleeding didn't tend to be of significant magnitude but did occur spontaneously and not necessarily in response to contact from clothes for example. The mole had darkened significantly in colour over the same period. His partner has told him, "this mole is far far darker than the others". The shape had also altered from being "perfectly round to more oval". He had experienced no other forms of discharge or any associated pain or inflammation. There was no associated itch or altered sensation. His mole really caused him little concern, it was his wife who urged him to consult his GP for advice. <heading>Past Medical History. </heading> had no significant past medical or surgical history. Of dermatological relevance, he has no history of eczema, psoriasis, hayfever, urticaria, asthma, dry skin, varicose veins or leg ulcers. He did appear to have excessive distribution of moles and had never had a skin cancer before. No history of diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, jaundice, strokes, heart attacks, rheumatoid or osteoarthritis, cervical arthropathy, obstructive sleep apnoea, acromegaly or thyroid disease. <heading>Systems Review: </heading>No significant findings to note. <heading>Medication. </heading>He takes no prescribed or alternative medication.

He drinks alcohol socially with maximum weekly consumption of approximately 16 units. <heading>Analysis of history The most likely single cause of the presentation, other possible causes and reasons for these choices.

Presents as a rapidly growing pigmented nodule which bleeds or ulcerates. Rarely are non-pigmented/amelanotic and can mimic pyogenic granuloma. Superficial spreading malignant melanoma - a flat, irregularly pigmented lesion, large in size. Grows laterally before vertical invasion develops.

Of the minor criteria, his mole measures more than 6mm and it bleeds spontaneously on regular occasions. History of sun exposure in childhood and intermittent exposure in adulthood are particularly important aetiological factors in the development of malignant melanoma.  had been severely sunburnt in his childhood across his back and shoulder blades. Other predisposing factors include atypical mole syndrome, giant congenital melanocytic naevi, lentigo maligna and positive family history of malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma is commoner in later life but can affect younger individuals. Incidence is continuing to increase due to excessive exposure to sunlight. <heading>Physical and mental state examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading>A middle-aged gentleman who appeared fit and non-septic.

Painless, frank haematuria is commonly the presenting symptom of bladder cancer and is an 'alarm' symptom warranting an urgent 2 week referral from a primary care setting (GP) to secondary care (hospital) for further investigation.  fast-tracked this process by self-presenting straight to secondary care. A diagnosis of bladder cancer is made by cystoscopy and should cancer be found regular cystoscopic screening is advised to monitor future occurrence of neoplastic growth. Clearly the earlier the diagnosis, the sooner treatment can be started and the better the prognosis for the patient.  presented with an 'alarm' symptom of cancer and although was found not to have this it was crucial he received treatment investigative of such. The prognosis of bladder cancer ranges from a 5-year survival of 80-90% for lesions not involving bladder muscle to 5% for those invasive cancers with metastatic spread. Patients from a stable family background and with social support respond best to treatment. His family could contribute towards care and as such should be involved in his treatment and diagnosis.
