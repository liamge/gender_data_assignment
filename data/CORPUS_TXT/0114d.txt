<heading>Referral information Source of referral and a summary of key information</heading>Mr  is a 65-year-old right-handed male admitted routinely on  for dysarthria. <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, and current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background. The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading>Mr  had three presenting complaints; dysarthria, dysphagia and weight loss. Elaborating on his dysarthria  said it came on suddenly 3/12 ago; he woke in the morning with a more nasal tone, and had problems pronouncing certain words (e.g. constitution). He has no history of vocal problems. He stated his speech had not changed since then, and had no diurnal variation. Volume and content of speech were normal. Approximately 3-4 weeks ago,  began having problems swallowing. Mr  said it occurred when he attempted to swallow quickly; doing so caused him to cough. He finds it more difficult to swallow solids rather than liquids. Material painlessly sticks at the level of his larynx.  said he finds the regurgitation of phlegm especially troublesome. He was prescribed antibiotics, and this helped. When his problems swallowing began, he also suffered from a general left-sided weakness, which lasted one day with no persistent sequalae. There is variation in his dysphagia, although he could not elaborate further. Mr  has unintentionally lost more than 2 stone (13kg) over the preceding 3 months. He has a good appetite, and tries to eat when he can. He has not recently suffered from abdominal pain, experienced a change in bowel habit, there is no change in stool colour, and there has been no overt rectal bleeding. Mr  is a former smoker of 200 pack-years. He does not drink. Mr  also complains of shortness of breath on exertion. He can no longer climb a flight of stairs. He has a wheeze he attributes to asthma, which was diagnosed one year ago, for which he is prescribed Combivent and Salbutamol. Mr  was also diagnosed with emphysema 4 years ago. He has not recently suffered from a productive cough, haemoptysis, or recent chest pain. There have been no night sweats or fever.  was also diagnosed with angina 1 year ago. He is currently prescribed: <list>GTN 1 100 g/dose prn, Salbutamol 200 g/dose prn, Combivent 200mcg/inh. 2 puffs qds, Ferrous sulphate 200 mg tds. Aspirin 75mg od, Bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg od. </list>He has no known allergies. Mr  is a retired labourer who lives at home with his wife. He has three children, one of whom lives locally. There is no significant family history. A systems review was unremarkable. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading><list><heading>General: HR 75, reg.

Fibrillations, fasciculations and jitter analysis give a clinical picture consistent with MND." A blood result with Creatinine Kinase in the range of 400-600g/l would also be compatible with MND with this clinical picture. <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading>"Unfortunately, you are suffering from a type of motor neurone disease called amytrophic lateral sclerosis. This is a progressive problem of the nerves supplying the muscle fibres in your body, which will cause increasing weakness of the voluntary muscles in your body, and then muscles that serve other functions, such as swallowing and respiration. We can give you medications and help to help relieve your symptoms, and there is one medication that will slow the progress of your symptoms for 3-5 months on average. However, the outlook for this disease is not good, with a mean survival from diagnosis of between 2-5 years." <heading>Prescription/medical intervention</heading>Mr  could further be prescribed riluzole 50mg bd po. <heading>Observation </heading>Observed on ward.

Three trials used riluzole at 100 mg/day and one used doses of 50, 100 and 200mg/day. Individuals were under 75 years, had a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ³60% in three trials, with two of these also excluding patients who had suffered from MND for more than 5 years. The fourth trial recruited individuals who were older or who had a greater duration of disease (> 5 years) or who had a FVC<60%. All trials used tracheostomy-free survival as a primary outcome. Most individuals (in all four trials) were prevalent, rather than incident cases. The assessment report reviewed the results from all four of the trials identified and reported riluzole to be associated with a relative reduction in hazard ratio for tracheostomy-free survival at 18 months of 17% (i.e. hazard ratio of 0.88, 95% CI: 0.75-1.02). There was some evidence of heterogeneity across the results of these four trials. Current estimates of the cost-effectiveness of riluzole must be viewed cautiously. Some of the key remaining uncertainties on benefits for the economic analysis concern the disease stage(s) in which the survival gain is experienced, the quality of life utility weights for ALS health states and the mean gain in life expectancy for individuals who take riluzole. Estimates from the two fully published trials suggest a gain in median tracheostomy free survival time of 2 months to 4 months. It is clear that riluzole is associated with a net increase in costs to the health service, though the magnitude of the increase is difficult to predict accurately. The Appraisal Committee considered the evidence of the clinical and cost effectiveness of this technology by reference to the Directions to the Institute issued by the Secretary of State. The Committee took account of the severity and relatively short life span of people with ALS and in particular, as directly reported to it, of the values which patients place on the extension of tracheostomy free survival time. With these considerations in mind, the Committee considered that the net increase in cost for the NHS of the use of riluzole in this indication was reasonable when set against the benefit, assessed as extended months of an acceptable (to patients) quality of life [1].</quote><heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>Motor Neurone Disease is a degenerative disease of unknown cause that affects predominantly motor neurons of the spinal cord, cranial nerve nuclei and motor cortex. It therefore affects both upper and lower motor neurones. Its incidence is approximately 2/100 000, except in endemic areas such as Guam. Prevalence is 5-6/100 000. It is twice as common in males. The mean age of onset is 55 years, although the youngest recorded case was 16, and the eldest 77 years of age. Diagnosis is clinical; it is usually an easily identifiable condition. It has three classifications: Amytrophic lateral sclerosis- The most common form, accounting for 65-85% of cases of MND. Has both UMN and LMN features. Results from lesions to the corticospinal tract and the anterior horn cells and produces the characteristic feature of tonic atrophy - brisk reflexes and fasciculations. AML may have bulbar involvement. Progressive muscular atrophy- PMA accounts for 15-35% of cases of MND. Progressive muscular atrophy results from a lesion of anterior horn cells. The presentation is with asymmetrical limb wasting and weakness progressing to a condition where lower motor neurone signs predominate. Bulbar or pseudobulbar palsy/ mixed. Either a spastic, flaccid or mixed presentation of MND. It should be noted that the above are not distinct aetiological or pathological variants; they usually merge as the condition worsens. The two commonest presentations of MND are dysarthria (25%) and hand wasting (10%). Other presentations are equally vague. Combined UMN and LMN signs are present in 65% cases. Lower limb weakness with spasticity commonly occurs, as dose respiratory difficulty. Important negative features of MND include no sensory/cognitive loss (cf MS), no sphincter involvement or ocular invlovement (cf myasthenia gravis). The aetiology of MND is not understood, but two theories have been hypothesised: Excitotoxicity. Toxins interacting with glutamate receptors result in cellular Ca 2+ overload. Riluzole works by glutamate activity. Oxidative damage due to free radicals. Motor neurone damage by a cascade of reactions initiated by electron capture by oxygen free radicals e.g. superoxide and peroxide. The latest thinking on this progressive, degenerative disease is that relentless degeneration of motor nerve cells is programmed genetically, and combines with the above processes. Abnormal RNA splicing of the excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT2 gene was once thought to be specific for MND, although non-sufferers have recently been discovered with this gene. There is a familial form of MND with mutations on 21q encoding for free radical scavenging copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD-1). Management of MND is symptomatic, and only one treatment had been shown to halt progression. Riluzole is a sodium channel blocker that inhibits glutamate release. It slows progression slightly (3-5 months) and is more effective in those with bulbar onset. Survival may be prolonged by ventilatory support and feeding via gastrostomy. Outlook for MND is bleak; remission is unknown. The disease exhibits a gradual progression and usually causes death from bronchopneumonia or respiratory failure. Survival for more than 3 years is unusual, although there are some variants in which patients survive for a decade or longer. Giving accurate advice to MND patients is especially difficult. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading>Bulbar and pseudobulbar palsy; presentation of MND, end of life issues.
