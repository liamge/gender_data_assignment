<heading>Referral information Source of referral and a summary of key information</heading>Suddenly over night developed severe pain in his knees in feet, which was so bad he couldn't out pressure on his feet. GP was called out who prescribed him painkillers, he said he couldn't do anything else without blood tests. Patient went to the  to get some bloods taken. Stayed on the floor of the living room the next night as couldn't get up the stairs. Came into A&E via ambulance as an emergency to the  on the  as the pain had not subsided and he was unable to walk to the toilet or upstairs. Drs in A&E admitted him. <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background.

Slept on the floor. Pain in feet was all over an agonising burning/achy pain. It was v tender/sore to the touch, the point were he couldn't bear anything to touch his legs, not even clothing. The pain as bout 8=9 out of 10 on the pains scale. Nothing really made the pain any better. The tramadol he was prescribed didn't do much good, seems to be working now. Movement and pressure seems to make it worse. He thinks a similar thing happened on his right foot after he had an arthroscopy 12 months ago. But nothing as bad as this current episode. Knees and feet were swollen, red and every hot to the touch. No other joints were effected. His bowels have stayed the same apart from the tramadol giving him some constipation more recently. No problems with his waterworks. He was generally feeling well prior to this episode, no fever, not feeling run down. Hadn't been eating large amounts of offal, protein or drinking lots of alcohol before this admission. <heading>Past medical history:</heading>Some arthritic knee pain over the last 5 years and niggling right thumb pain Had viral pneumonia at age of 41 Type II diabetes, controlled on diet and tablets, was diagnosed about 6 years ago. 12 months ago had an investigative arthroscopy on right knee Never had a MI, stroke, epilepsy. RF. Does have slightly raised cholesterol and blood pressure. <heading>Family history:</heading>His mother had arthritis, but he doesn't think she was treated for it. He thinks his brother had a similar problem with his hand, where his hand was so tender he didn't want clothes on it, but he is not sure what the diagnosis was. His other brother is fine. <heading>Drug history and allergies:</heading><list>NKDAAspirin 75mg OD POPravastatin 40mg OD POGlimitizide 2mg OD POFelodipine 10mg OD PODoxazosin 8mg OD POThyroxine 100 micrograms OD POColchicine 500 micrograms OD POTramadol 50 mg BD POLactulose 10mls TDS POPRN:Tramadol 50mg (maximum dose 100mg and maximum per 24 hours = 400 mg)</list><heading>Social history:</heading>Lives in  with his wife who has an arthritic hip and neck, both can manage the stairs and ADLs He has 3 daughters and 2 sons all are well.

Knee xr NAD Arthroscopy showed grade IV OA on right knee, patient having total knee replacement in august Both knees aspirated the aspirate contained calcium pyrophosphate crystals Diagnosis = polyarticular crystal arthropathy or polyarticualr septic joints, the latter is less likely. Why anaemia? Why lymphocytes going down? B12, folate and ferritin all normal Urate = 640 Diagnosis is pseudo gout <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>This usually asymptomatic condition of the elderly is due to deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals in large joints, most commonly the knee. The crystals are initially deposited in the cartilage - chondrocalcinosis - where they are associated with degenerative changes. The shedding of the crystals into the joint space results in an acute synovitis and a clinical picture that is similar to that seen in gout. This condition is more common in men (ratio of 1.5:1). <list><heading>pseudogout: </heading>usually presents as an acute synovitis often affecting the knee radiology shows calcification of articular cartilage and, if the knee is involved, of the menisci CPPD crystals are demonstrable in aspirated synovial fluid</list>gout - occurs generally in patients over 40 years old; affects small joints, especially the great toe; clinical features include severe joint pain and swelling, hyperuricaemia; radiological features include soft-tissue swelling; there is uric acid crystal deposition in affected joints; treatment measures include rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs e.g. diclofenac, in chronic gout allopurinol prophylaxis pseudogout - usually affects the elderly; large joints generally involved (especially the knee joint); clinical features include moderate joint pain and swelling; radiology reveals calcification of articular cartilage menisci; calcium pyrophosphate crystals are deposited in affected joints; possible treatment measures include rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and joint aspiration radiology - reveals linear opacification of articular cartilage examination of synovial fluid - shows positively birefringent crystals arthroscopy - 'microtophi' on the synovial membrane tests to investigate associated conditions Treatment consists of the well tried combination of rest and NSAID's. Intra-articular injection of corticosteroids or joint aspiration may be used in more severe cases. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management.
