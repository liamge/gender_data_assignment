<heading>Introduction</heading>Before PC based test systems engines were road tested to obtain performance parameters. This was slow, expensive and proved difficult to gather data at required engine parameters. This report looks into how modern PC based test systems are used to determine engine performance. The engine under investigation in this report is the Rover 1.4 litre K16 engine. The K series Rover engine is a popular design and is used in Rover, Lotus & Caterham cars. There are various sizes and types of engine within the K series groups including 8 & 16 valve variants, named K8 or K16 respectively. Engine sizes vary from 1.1 litre to 2.5 litre V6. The Rover K16 engine is one of many automobile engines that obtain high fuel efficiency by the use of lean burn. Operating a lean mixture allows added power to be gained from the engine whilst maintaining low fuel consumption values. Pulkrabek explains how higher power is obtained in his book 'Engineering Fundamentals of the Internal Combustion Engine', "by running a lean mixture flame speed is slow, and combustion lasts well past Top Dead Centre (TDC). This keeps the pressure high well into the power stroke, which produces greater power output". <heading>Aims</heading>The main aims of this report are: To explore the CADET's capabilities as a PC base engine test system. Use the CADET system to investigate the operating characteristics of a Rover K16 engine.

A more useful relative engine performance measure is to divide the work per cycle by the cylinder volume displacement per cycle. This parameter is called Break Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP) and is measured in units of force per unit area. <enote>JOHN B HEYWOOD - "Internal combustion engine fundamentals", Chapter 2 p46 </enote> FORMULA  Most good engine designs obtain very similar BMEP values, which allow direct comparison between different engine sizes. Rearranging Error! Reference source not found. and assuming appropriate value for BMEP the value of Torque or power at a specified speed can be estimated given the engines displacement. Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (bsfc) is defined as:  FORMULA  Typical values for a normally aspirated Spark Ignition (SI) engine are between  FORMULA  850-1050 KPa. With maximum torque at 3000 rev/min. <enote>WILLARD W.

The program listing the stage types and engine test program can be seen in Appendix 1. A detailed description of the CADET systems stage types can be found in the software manual for the CADET Engine Test System. <enote>C P Engineering "CADET Engine Test System, Software Manual" 1992 </enote><heading>Results</heading>The load applied to the engine was used to control the engine speed. For each specified engine speed the engine torque and power were recorded and can be seen in Table 1 <table/>To obtain the performance map of the Rover K16 engine the following parameters are monitored: <list>Engine Speed [rev/min]Torque [Nm]Power [KW]Fuel flow [g/s]</list>Rearranging Error! Reference source not found. torque values can be estimated for given BMEP values. For a BMEP of 2 bar the torque produced is:  FORMULA  At specified torque values the parameters listed above were measured, and can be seen in Table 2. From these results the bsfc can be calculated using Error! Reference source not found. , the results of which can be seen in Table 3. From Table 3 it is possible to produce a performance map which shows contours of constant bsfc on a graph of bmep against engine speed. <table/><table/><figure/><figure/><heading>Discussion</heading><heading>Power & Torque Curves</heading>The power and torque values for different engine speeds have been plotted in Graph 1. It can be seen that power increases with engine speed, from 2000 rev/min up to 4500 rev/min the power is almost linear, above 4500 rev/min the power begins to drop off. If further tests were made at higher engine speeds it would show a dramatic drop in power, this can be seen in Figure 1. This drop in power can be attributed to the "increase in frictional flow losses and the flow into the engine during at least part of the intake process becoming choked". Since the engines flow rate is now being restricted the volumetric efficiency of the engine decreases. <enote>JOHN B HEYWOOD - "Internal combustion engine fundamentals" p218 </enote>The torque drops off at lower engine speeds due to reduced thermal efficiency since there is more heat loss between cycles. The volumetric efficiency decreases at low engine speeds due to back flow caused by the late inlet valve closing which is designed to allow increased air flow at high engine speeds. <figure/>Looking at the torque curve in Graph 1 it can be seen that the maximum torque value is at approximately 4300 rev/min. This maximum value appears in the mid range of the engines speed range where the engine is operating most efficiently. To achieve a constant torque engine the volumetric efficiency would need to be 100% which is unattainable. Factors such as valve timing, valve lift, porting, and intake manifold design all effect the volumetric efficiency of the engine. In the case of the K16 engine tested in this report maximum torque is designed around mid rev range (2000-5000 rev/min) under normal driving conditions. This is achieved by tuning the valve timing* so that maximum air-flow is achieved around the required rev range, between 3500 - 4500 rev/min. Engines with variable valve timing such as the K16 1.8 VVC (Variable valve control) can achieve a more linear torque curve than fixed valve timing engines. <enote>* The adjustment of inlet and exhaust values opening/closing, and valve overlap </enote><heading>Performance Map</heading>The performance map in Graph 2 shows contours of constant bsfc against BMEP vs. Engine speed. The performance map agrees with the description given by Colin R. Ferguson in his book "Internal combustion Engines Applied Thermosciences" page 479 which states that "typically the bsfc is minimum at about 60% of the maximum BMEP and 60% of the maximum piston speed". Comparing this to the performance map in Graph 2 it can be seen that minimum bsfc occurs at 60% engine speed ~3500 rev/min and BMEP values of approximately 5.5-6 bar. Heywood relates these performance map characteristics to variations in volumetric efficiency, ηv, gross indicated fuel conversion efficiency, ηf ig, mechanical efficiency, ηm, and the importance of heat loss. The bsfc contours have the following explanations, starting from minimum bsfc value. As engine speed increases at constant load the bsfc value increases primarily due to the increase in friction mean effective pressure at higher engine speeds (which decreases the mechanical efficiency). Decreasing engine speed at constant load increases the bsfc value due the increase in heat transfer per cycle which decreases thermal efficiency. A secondary effect is that mechanical efficiency increases due to the reduced friction. Increasing the engine load at constant engine speed increases the bsfc value due to the mixture enrichment beyond stoichiometric required to increase the torque as the engine becomes increasingly air-flow limited. The further from stoichiometric air/fuel ration the bigger the bsfc value. Decreasing the engine load the bsfc value increases due to the increase magnitude of friction (due to the increase in pumping work), the increased relative importance of friction and increasing importance of heat transfer. Comparing the two graphs characteristics it can be seen that around peak torque the bsfc value is minimum. Peak torque occurs under stoichiometric air/fuel ratio, where combustion is most efficient producing the lowest bsfc region. As torque decreases, efficiency decreases and bsfc values increase. <heading>Engine Performance Results</heading>Graph 1 shows that the Rover K16 engine made maximum torque of 120Nm at 4300 rev/min (engine mid-range), with maximum power of 64KW occurring at the maximum tested speed of 5500 rev/min. Using the maximum torque value in Error! Reference source not found. the maximum bmep produced during test can be calculated.  FORMULA  This value is slightly lower than the value given by R. Stone which quotes a maximum bmep value of 11.2 bar at 3500 rev/min. Stone also states the maximum power from the engine to be 54 KW/litre (at 6000 rev/min), the results from Graph 1 give a value of approximately 45 KW/litre (at maximum tested engine speed 5500 rev/min). These difference can be attributed to many different factors such as air & fuel temperature, since lower temperatures increase the density of both air and fuel, humidity, engine state of tune etc. <heading>Conclusion</heading>This report has provided an insight into how a PC based control system can be used to gather engine performance data. The data collected by the CADET system for the Rover K16 engine gives a detailed insight into the engines performance characteristics. The results have shown that the K16 Rover engine has been designed to be most efficient when operating around its mid-rev range. This improves the engines drivability and fuel economy. It has been discussed how technology advancements, such as variable valve timing and electronic engine management systems have allowed engines to produce greater power and obtain higher fuel efficiency whilst meeting current EU emission regulations.
