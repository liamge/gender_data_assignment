<heading>Botanical information</heading>Orchids belong to the family of Orchidaceae. It is a unique group of plants that have over 800 genera and over 25000 species. There are two types of growth in Orchidaceae family; monopodial and sympodial. The stems are characterised by having one or more swollen internodes called pseudobulb. <heading>Characteristics of orchids family</heading>There are five characteristics that distinguish orchids in the plant kingdom. a) Zygomorphic flowers. The orchid flowers are irregular, characterised by having bilateral symmetry. Each flower can be cut only in one plane dividing into two equal pieces. b) The pollen grains. Pollen grains form a pack called pollinia. Column. The pistil and the anther have been fused forming a unit called column. Inside the column there is a canal that starts from the stigmatic surface and ends to the ovary. Rostellum. Its position is between the anther cap and the stigmatic surface. The rostellum has two special roles. First of all, it separates the male and the female parts of the flower in order to prevent self-pollination. Secondly, it is a gland, excreting a sticky substance on the back of any insect that comes into contact with it. As the insect tries to reach the base of the flower so as to take the nectar, its back rubs the rostellum, and a sticky substance is applied to it. As insect abandons the flower, the sticky substance comes in contact with pollinia, and the insect takes them to the next flower that visits, ensuring cross-pollination. Seeds. Orchid flowers produce great amount of seeds. One seed may contain from 500,000 to 1 million seeds. They lack of endosperm and as a result they are unable to germinate in the wild without the aid of a fungus. <heading>Most commonly known genera for cut flowers </heading>The most commonly known that are used for cut flowers are: <list>CattleyaCymbidiumPhalaenopsisDendrobiumVandaAscoscendaArachnids and its hybridsPaphiopedilum</list><heading>Propagation</heading>There are three types of propagation: Most monopodial orchids (Vanda) are propagated by tip cuttings. Some others monopodial or sympodial can be propagated by offsets that produce (Dendrobium). Other by flower stalks cuttings (Phalaenopsis). The second way of propagation is by division of the parent clump. The rhizome is cut and the two sections are two different plants. The final method of propagation is mericloning. It is a method where in one year can be produced one million plants from pre plant. The main advantages are uniformity of flowering and the fact that are identical to parental plants. <heading>Media used in orchids</heading>The most important is osmunda fiber that exists in two types. The first is the soft light brown and the second dark brown. Osmunda comes from the roots of osmunda ferns. It lasts approximately 2-4 years and contains 2-3% of nitrogen. The second media is tree ferns. The fiber comes from the stems of tree ferns and lasts 5-7 years. The last media are barks that are by-products of lumber industry. They contain little nitrogen and last 3-4 years. The fact that they are decomposed from many microorganisms affects nitrogen concentration, because it is obtained by them and not by plants. <heading>Water quality</heading>The most important factor in having a satisfactory production is water quality. All the plants have to be watered with the same amount of water. The best that growers can do is to group plants by size and pot medium in order to be sure that all plants receive the same amount of water. The best quality of water is at 125 ppm. <heading>Temperature requirements</heading>Temperature requirements vary among species. Cymbidium orchids require 10 0C night temperatures to produce flowers. A range of 21 0C- 24 0C at day is ideal. Cattleya requires 15 0C- 18 0C night temperatures in order to thrive. Phalaenopsis white flower varieties require 18 0C at night and 27 0C at day, while pink varieties require 13- 15 0C at night. <heading>Major pests</heading>Many insects attack orchids such as armoured scales, soft scales and mealy bugs. The most important found in orchids are Diaspis boisduvalii and Furcaspis biformis. <heading>Major diseases</heading>Petal blight attacks the petals of flower as the name indicates. Black rots are another serious diseases including Pythium and Phytophthora with the first the most important of the two. Viruses are the most important enemies of orchids because it is very difficult to control them and secondly they are transmitted easily by cutting tools during propagation and cutting of the flowers. <heading>Storage- shipping</heading>Orchids unlike many cut flowers do not store at - 1 0C. Flowers turn brown in three days at - 1 0C and their saleability decreases very rapidly. They can be stored at 5-7 0C for 10-14 days. Generally, they are very durable plants and as a result can be shipped long distances.
