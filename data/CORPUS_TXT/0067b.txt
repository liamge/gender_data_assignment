<abstract>Maternally expressed genes are essential for the correct patterning and cell-fate determination in the early Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. The PAR proteins and MEX-5/6 are responsible for initial polarisation of the zygote, skn-1 is required to specify the EMS fate, the bifunctional protein PIE-1 is required to maintain the totipotent germ cell lineage and specification of the AB lineage involves a system homologous to Notch in Drosophila. This review describes the current understanding of these molecular mechanisms in the specification of cell fates in the pregastrulation embryo. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>The potential of Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism for the study of embryology emerged in the 1970s (Brenner, 1974). This free-living soil nematode is ideal for studying in the laboratory as it has a rapid period of embryogenesis (16 hours) and each worm has an invariant cell lineage, with exactly 959 somatic cells in the adult, which can be easily traced during development through the transparent cuticle (Sulston & Horvitz, 1977). C.elegans is a small round-worm, approximately 1 mm long, that lives for 2-3 weeks and can be fed on Escherichia coli, which allows large numbers to be conveniently raised in a Petri dish. The predominant adult form is hermaphroditic, containing both sperm and eggs and therefore reproduction is rapid, either by self-fertilization or by cross-fertilization with the rare males. The genetics for C.elegans is advancing rapidly. It has a small genome at 8 x 10 7 bp and relatively few genes for a eukaryote - around 17,500. It was the first multicellular organism for which the genome was completely sequenced (C.elegans Sequencing Consortium 1999) and approximately 8,000 C.elegans proteins have already been matched to homologous human gene transcripts (Lai at al. , 2000). Specific mutants may be produced by targeted deletion through transposon insertion or mutagens. Embryos may be manipulated by transformation or injection with transgenes and marker proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) are easily visualised in the transparent embryos. RNA interference (RNAi) is a particularly useful technique for studying maternal effect genes by eliminating the expression of specific maternal or zygotic genes in offspring. <heading>Reproduction</heading>In hermaphrodite worms, fertilization occurs in the spermatheca - an organ where the sperm is stored - when mature oocytes pass from the ovary towards the vulva (Fig 1A-B). The point of sperm entry determines the posterior end of the embryo. After fertilization, a rigid, ovoid-shaped chitin eggshell called the chorion is made (Kemphues & Strome, 1997) and the long axis of this ovoid is termed the anteroposterior (a/p) axis of the embryo. <picture/><heading>Early cell lineage</heading>Cleavage of the zygote (P0) is asymmetric, forming two different daughter cells - a larger anterior blastomere, AB, and a smaller posterior blastomere, P1, which possess different fates. The AB blastomere goes on to divide equatorially (90Â°C to the a/p axis; Fig 1C), eventually forming pharyngeal, hypodermal and neural tissues. This division is followed by a series of meridional (transverse), asymmetrical divisions of the P-lineage (P1, P2, P3 and P4), which consists of stem cells at the posterior end that eventually form the primordial germ cells, Z2 and Z3. These divisions also form the remaining somatic 'founder cells' (MS, E, C and D) that produce differentiated descendents (Fig 1D). <heading>Initial asymmetries in the embryo</heading><heading>Fertilization</heading>Goldstein and Hird (1996) showed that the sperm defines the posterior end of the zygote and therefore the a/p axis. Oocytes are arrested in prophase I of meiosis as they pass through the spermatheca. Upon fertilization, the oocyte completes meiosis and the cytoskeleton is arranged by the sperm-derived centrosomes to create cytoplasmic streams. The flow of internal cytoplasm towards the posterior end and cortical cytoplasm towards the anterior end causes migration of the oocyte pronucleus to meet the sperm pronucleus at the posterior end where they fuse before migrating back to the centre of the embryo (Gotta & Ahringer, 2001; Golden, 2000). During the first cleavage, the mitotic spindle becomes asymmetrically placed along the a/p axis, requiring the microtubule protein dynein, the cortical DEP protein LET-99 and GPB-1 to rotate and position the mitotic spindle towards the posterior. A number of maternal factors involved in the determination of cell fates are partitioned differentially in the first few divisions. For instance, P granules are always segregated with the P-lineage and are thought to promote the germline fate, as we will see later. Mutations in the mes-1 gene affect polarity, spindle orientation and P granule localisation in the P2 & P3 blastomeres (Tenenhaus et al. , 2001). Polarisation of the zygote is essential for the correct segregation of these components and generation of cell diversity and specialisation during development of the embryo. <heading>Establishment of polarity - PAR and MEX proteins</heading>The first distinct phase of polarisation before pronuclear meeting is termed 'establishment' and involves the segregation of the cortical PAR proteins and cytoplasmic MEX-5/6 proteins, which provide polarity information during the first cell cycle and are necessary for the proper asymmetric distribution of cell-fate regulators such as MEX-3, MEX-1, MES-1 and PIE-1. Mutations of the par genes cause early partitioning defects including an equal first cleavage, synchronous second cleavage, mislocalisation of P granules and alterations to spindle orientation during the second cleavage. These defects lead to the variable absences of intestine and germline and excess of pharyngeal and body wall muscle. Signalling between the sperm asters and the actin cytoskeleton causes PAR-1 (a serine/threonine kinase identified as Dishevelled-associated kinase in Drosophila) and PAR-2 (a RING finger protein) to localise to the posterior cortex (Fig 2), while PAR-3 and PAR-6 localise to the anterior, in an evolutionarily conserved complex with an atypical protein kinase C called PKC-3. These proteins interact via their PDZ domains (Lyczak et al. , 2002). PAR-4 and PAR-5 are not polarised but remain enriched throughout the cortex. PAR-5 (a 14-3-3 protein) may serve to ensure a maximal response of the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 complex to the sperm aster and prevent overlap with PAR-2. Consistent with this possibility, PAR-3 contains a predicted 14-3-3 binding motif (Morton et al., 2002). A major function of PAR-1 is to localize the germline-specific protein, PIE-1, to the P-lineage (see below). <picture/>PAR polarisation is initiated by the sperm-derived microtubule organising centre (MTOC; Wallenfang & Seydoux, 2000). Chemical disruption of microfilaments with cytochalasin D - or RNA interference of the non-muscle myosin II heavy chain gene, nmy-2 or myosin light chain gene, mlc-4 - eliminates the cytoplasmic flows and pseudocleavage, causing PAR-3 and PAR-6 to remain throughout the cortex (Guo & Kemphues, 1996; Cuenca et al. , 2003). Maturation of functional paternal centrosomes, however, requires the maternal gene spd-2 (O'Connell et al. , 2000). Other genes with suggestive roles in intracellular trafficking come from pod-1 and pod-2 (polarity and osmotic defective) and ooc-3 and ooc-5 mutants (Gotta & Ahringer, 2001). The predominantly cytoplasmic proteins MEX-5 and MEX-6 also play a role during the establishment phase (Fig 2). Although these proteins appear not to be absolutely essential for PAR localisation, it is thought they ensure a rapid response by the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 complex to the MTOC/actin cytoskeleton signal. In a model proposed by Cuenca et al. (2003), clearance of PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 complexes, enhanced by MEX-5/6, and accumulation of PAR-1 and PAR-2 at the posterior end may constitute a feedback loop in which PAR-1 presence reduces MEX-5/6 expression (Fig 2). <heading>Maintenance</heading>Following fusion of the two pronuclei, the MTOC-dependent signal is switched off and PAR-1, PAR-2 and another protein, CDC-42 become essential for exclusion of the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 complex from the posterior of the zygote. How these proteins function together to maintain the balance between anterior and posterior PAR domains remains to be determined (Cuenca et al. , 2003). There is also evidence that the PAR proteins are important in subsequent cell divisions (Lyczak et al., 2002). <heading>Fate of the EMS blastomere: the role of skn-1</heading>Patterning in the early embryo is a result of the complex interaction between oriented asymmetric divisions and cell-cell interactions. For example, the P1 cell is able to develop autonomously in the absence of AB, but the daughters of AB require interactions from the descendents of P1 - the EMS and P2 blastomeres. Proper development of the EMS blastomere is determined by signals from P2 (via the Wnt pathway) as well as the autonomous, maternally expressed transcription factor SKN-1, as described in this section. SKN-1 is a predicted 61 kDa protein, largely hydrophobic, containing homologous regions to the bZIP (leucine zipper) class of transcription factors and the ant homeodomain in Drosophila (Bowerman et al. , 1992). Unlike the bZIP proteins, however, SKN-1 lacks a dimerisation segment and binds DNA as a monomer (Fig 3). During cleavage of the zygote, SKN-1 protein is loaded unequally between the P1 and AB sister blastomeres, an effect mediated by MEX-1 and PAR-1. SKN-1 is required for differentiation of the EMS daughter of P1: in skn-1 mutant embryos, neither EMS nor its daughter E develops normally, instead of making pharyngeal and intestinal structures they produce extra hypodermal and body wall tissues. skn-1+ male sperm are unable to rescue embryos from skn-1-/- mothers, indicating that maternal expression of the skn-1 gene is necessary for normal embryogenesis. In mex-1 mutant embryos, pharyngeal cells are produced from both AB and P1 descendents (Bowerman et al. , 1993). <picture/>SKN-1 activates the transcription of at least two genes, med-1 and med-2, whose products are also transcription factors. The MED transcription factors appear to specify the fate of the EMS cell, since expression of the med genes in other cells can cause non-EMS cells to become EMS, even in the absence of SKN-1. SKN-1 protein is present in the embryo from the 2-cell stage until the 12-cell stage, when it suddenly disappears. However, zygotic expression is required post-embryogenesis, for the development of intestinal cells (Maduro et al. , 2001). <heading>Differentiation of the EMS daughter cells</heading>Following cleavage of EMS, SKN-1 mediates the endodermal development of the E blastomere. The transcription factor POP-1 is necessary to repress SKN-1 in the MS cell, to prevent it also becoming endoderm. POP-1 in the posterior EMS daughter receives signals from MOM-1 and MOM-2 (Wnt pathway components) and a receptor tyrosine kinase from P2 to allow SKN-1 to switch on endodermal genes in that cell, which becomes E (Fig 4; Maduro <picture/><heading>Differentiation of the C and D blastomeres</heading>The somatic descendents of the P2 blastomere (C and D) require another putative transcription factor, PAL-1. PAL-1 is regulated by the MEX-3 protein, which binds to pal-1 mRNA, inhibiting its translation. PAL-1 is also inhibited by SKN-1, preventing it from acting in the EMS cell (Hunter & Kenyon, 1996). <heading>Development of the germline: gene regulation by PIE-1 and MEX-1</heading>After the second cleavage, equal levels of SKN-1 are found in both daughters of the P1 blastomere, EMS and P2. However, only EMS produces pharyngeal cells and P2 is still able to develop into a healthy germline in skn-1 mutant embryos. The maternal protein PIE-1 is segregated with the germ lineage and is necessary for the germline fate by inhibiting both SKN-1 and PAL-1 function in the P2 and subsequent germline cells (Mello et al. , 1992). In embryos from pie-1 mutant mothers (pharynx and intestine in excess), germline blastomeres adopt somatic fates, with the P2 cell behaving as a wildtype EMS blastomere (Fig 5; Mello et al. , 1992). <figure/><heading>Transcriptional silencing of somatic genes</heading>PIE-1 is a novel 38 kDa protein whose structure is not similar to any known transcription factors, although it contains two CCCH zinc-finger domains that have been shown to bind RNA in other proteins, implicating a role in mRNA cleavage, processing and/or turnover. However, later studies provided evidence for a role in the direct repression of zygotic transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Firstly, PIE-1 is present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm (Mello et al. , 1996). Secondly, PIE-1 disappears from the germline shortly after division of P4 into Z2 and Z3, coinciding with the onset of zygotic transcription, as determined by the appearance of the H5 phosphoepitope on the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNAPII (RNAPII-H5). Somatic blastomeres acquire the ability to transcribe new mRNA minutes after separation from the germ lineage, and furthermore, newly transcribed mRNAs are additionally detected in germline blastomeres in pie-1 mutants (Fig 5). Also, the ectopic expression of PIE-1 in somatic cells by transformation of the pie-1 gene fused to a heat shock promoter represses embryonic transcription (Seydoux & Strome, 1999). It is suggested that PIE-1 suppresses the action of maternally encoded transcription factors such as SKN-1 from activating zygotic genes that promote somatic fates through the general repression of mRNA transcription by RNAPII in germline blastomeres, thus protecting the germline fate. skn-1::pie-1 double mutants do not produce germ cells either, indicating that other factors are involved in germ cell determination (Mello et al. , 1992). The mechanism of transcriptional repression has recently been dissected (Batchelder et al. , 1999; Zhang et al. , 2003). Unexpectedly, instead of transcriptional initiation, PIE-1 inhibits transcriptional elongation. The process of elongation requires phosphorylation by CDK9 (a cyclin-dependent kinase, associated with cyclin T in the P-TEFb complex) of the RNAPII-H5 phosphoepitope. In transfected mammalian HeLa cells, PIE-1 inhibits CDK9, through a sequence (YAPMAPT) similar to the repeated heptapepide sequence in the RNAPII C-terminal domain (YSPTSPS) and that apparently competes for CDK9 (Zhang et al., 2003; Strome, 2005). <heading>Expression of maternal factors essential for germ cell development</heading>The presence of PIE-1 also in the cytoplasm, where it is commonly found associated with P granules (Fig 6B), suggests a further role in germline development. P granules are rich in maternal mRNAs and the second zinc-finger motif (ZF2) of PIE-1 is necessary and sufficient to target it to the P granules (Tenenhaus et al. 2001). One maternal mRNA associated with P granules is nos-2 (a homolog of Nanos in Drosophila), which is normally expressed in P4 and is required for the correct migration of Z2 and Z3 to meet the somatic gonads. nos-2 is not translated in P4 from pie-1 mutants, indicating that pie-1 also promotes the expression of maternally encoded factors essential for primordial germ cell development. This role can be genetically and functionally separated from the transcriptional silencing described above by mutations that affect either one function or the other (Tenenhaus et al. , 2001). MEX-1 is similar in structure to PIE-1 but is found only associated with P granules in the cytoplasm where it also regulates gene expression, with different targets to PIE-1. mex-1 mutations disrupt segregation of P granules, prevent formation of germ cells and cause inappropriate patterns of somatic cell differentiation. <picture/><heading>Segregation of P granules, PIE-1 and MEX-1</heading>MEX-1 localisation is dependent on PAR segregation and is in turn required to restrict pie-1 expression and activity to germline blastomeres. P granules are unstable in somatic cytoplasm (Hird et al., 1996) and PIE-1 and MEX-1 are degraded in somatic lineages by interactions with ubiquitin ligase via the ZF1 domain (Spike & Strome, 2003). <heading>Determining AB lineage fates: the C.elegans maternal Notch system</heading>The early Aba and Abp blastomeres are identical and exchangeable (Priess & Thomson, 1987); however, in the late 4-cell stage, these two cells are committed to different fates. This determination requires the Notch-like receptor, GLP-1, and the Delta-like membrane-bound ligand, APX-1. <heading>4-cell stage</heading>Maternal GLP-1 mRNA is found in oocytes and all blastomeres up to the 8-cell stage but its translation is regulated temporally and spatially such that, at the 4-cell stage GLP-1 is detected only in the AB blastomeres (Evans et al., 1994). A reporter RNA study identified a region of 125 bases at the 3' end of the 3' UTR of glp-1 mRNA, called the temporal control region (TCR), and a 66-base spatial control region (SCR) in the middle of the 3' UTR. The TCR is required for the suppression of translation of glp-1 mRNA in oocytes and one-cell embryos whilst the SCR suppresses translation in the posterior blastomeres (Evans et al. , 1994). The APX-1 signal in the membrane of P2 breaks the initial symmetry between ABa and Abp by stimulating GLP-1 only on the AB daughter that it touches (ABp). In doing this, the P2 blastomere initiates the dorsal/ventral axis of C.elegans and determines the different fates of the AB descendents (Fig 4). APX-1 translation is regulated by POS-1. Maternal apx-1 mRNA is present in all early blastomeres but APX-1 is only expressed in P1 at the 2-cell stage and in EMS but mainly in the membrane of P2 in the 4-cell stage (Mickey et al. , 1996). In pos-1 mutant embryos (lethal), APX-1 is not detected in spite of the abundant apx-1 mRNA (Tabara et al. 1999). POS-1 is another protein with two CCCH zinc finger motifs (Ogura et al., 2003) and is observed in the posterior blastomeres as a temporary component of P granules (Tabara et al. 1999). Ogura et al. (2003) recently show that POS-1 binds the SCR region of glp-1 mRNA via its ZF2 domain, negatively regulating its translation in posterior blastomeres. In anterior blastomeres, SPN-4 interacts with POS-1 and also binds the TCR of glp-1 mRNA via its RNP-type RNA binding domain to promote translation. <heading>12-cell stage</heading>The GLP-1 receptor is also required in ABa descendents at the 12-cell stage to mediate signals from the MS blastomere that are required for pharyngeal development. Transcription of these unknown ligands is initiated by SKN-1. Asymmetric induction of the two ABa descendents forms the left-right axis. The different responses to inductive signals that use a common receptor are dependent on the age of the AB descendent when the signal is received (Shelton & Bowerman, 1996). In both cases, however, the pharyngeal precursor cells only are instructed to activate the pha-4 gene, encoding a transcription factor that activates almost all of the pharynx-specific genes (Mango et al. 1994, Gaudet & Mango, 2002). <heading>Summary</heading>Embryogenesis relies almost exclusively on maternal proteins and RNAs loaded into the oocyte during oogenesis. Patterning arises through a combination of oriented, intrinsically asymmetric cell divisions and cell-cell interactions. The PAR proteins and MEX-5/6 are responsible for initial polarisation of the zygote, skn-1 is required to specify the EMS fate, the bifunctional protein PIE-1 is required to maintain the totipotent germ cell lineage and specification of the AB lineage involves a system homologous to Notch in Drosophila.
