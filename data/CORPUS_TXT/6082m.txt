<heading>Introductions and Aims</heading>Tartaric acid, has E number: E334, is responsible for the low acidity of wine, which is also used as a source of buffers and taste modifiers in the food industry. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is a crucial additive to wines, as a preservative and antioxidant, which protects our bodies against free radicals that lead to cell damage. The aim of the practical is to analyse acidity and free and total SO 2 present in a French medium dry white wine provided. <heading>Hazards </heading><table/><heading>3.2 determination of Acidity - Weak acid strong base titration</heading><heading>Methods and Observations</heading>10cm 3 wine was pipetted into a conical flask Then was diluted to about 50cm 3 with distilled water 4 drops phenolphthalein indicator were added into the conical flask A burette was filled with 0.1M NaOH solution.

The wine has low pH2.7 as measured means the French medium dry white wine is highly acidic, which confirms the high tartaric acid percentage calculated as 72.25%. These demonstrate a fairly valid and reliable set of results, and no major errors had been observed. <heading>3.3 Determination of Sulphur Dioxide - iodine & redox titration</heading><heading>Methods and Observations</heading><table/>Positive end points observed qualitatively - blue black complex formed with starch.

Wine used in the two titrations are obtained from different boxes provided, as the first box had been finished by the time the total SO 2 titration was prepared. <heading>(p.3 & 4) FORMULA Calculaions</heading><heading>3.4 Questions</heading><heading>Discussion and conclusion</heading>Under limited time, the two redox titrations carried out to determine SO 2 contents in wine are not as accurate and no further repeats were possible carried out. On the other hand, they are the hardest titrations in terms of observing end points, as the first blue black colour usually fades shortly. This problem has certainly affected the accuracy, reliability and validity of the results. The Averages I2 solution volumes have been calculated based on the results shown in Tables 4 and 5 (p. 2). Here are some possible improvements on the practical: The entire titration (with the repeats) should be carried by the same experimenter, in order to obtain as high consistency as possible. Both the 25cm 3 wine for free and total SO 2 titrations should be obtained from the same box for fair test. For total SO 2 titration (step 2), Instead of leaving to stand for 5-10 minutes and swirling 25cm 3 1.0M NaOH occasionally, it is preferred to be more specific and to set a duration of the step. It is always ideal to use a clean dry conical flask for each titration carried. This could minimise errors. Nevertheless, accurate set of apparatus were used: 50cm 3 burette (± 0.05cm 3), 10cm 3 bulb pipette, etc. The free and total SO 2 present have been calculated below.
