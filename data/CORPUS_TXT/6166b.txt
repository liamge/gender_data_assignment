 has recently carried out a study on the daily diet of 86 students (23 males, 63 females; aged 19-38) majoring in nutrition by the Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ) method. Students almost can consume food following the dietary reference values (DRV) of the UK. However, there's not much difference in most of the dietary values between the students and the general UK residents (Hendersonal. 2003) except that the students have a less satisfactory result in the consumption of macronutrients (Table 1). <table/> FORMULA  ^ UK mean is from the NDNS 2003 report, the mean of the "total" age groups There are totally 36 diet intake items have been generated the mean and standard deviation values. Those values are then categorized into male, female and total groups. The diet intake items included macronutrients like total fats, carbohydrate; and micronutrients like calcium, iron and vitamin A-E. Among all those diet intake items, male group usually have greater values than the females due to greater energy requirement and consumption of them. The only exception is that men ingest (71.3mg; mean) slightly less vitamin C than women (72mg). <heading>Macronutrients</heading>Protein, carbohydrate (sugar, starch, fibers), total fats (saturated, monosaturated, polysaturated, cholesterol) and alcohol are the main contributions to the total energy intake (excluding fiber). Ideally, around 55-60% and 30-35% of energy should come from carbohydrates and fats, while only 10% should come from protein. The group of total expressed quite an ideally ratio in the energy intake with around 46%, 31%, 17% and 6% of energy from carbohydrate, total fat, protein and alcohol respectively. <fnote>1 gram carbohydrate / Protein = ~4kcal </fnote><fnote>1 gram fat = ~9kcal </fnote><fnote>1 gram alcohol = ~7kcal </fnote><heading>High energy, fat, cholesterol, alcohol and protein intake in male group</heading>From table 1, the mean of male energy intake is 2536 kcal while standard deviation is 464 kcal. In other words, more than 50% male intake 2536 kcal daily; and 16% of them even intake more than 3000 kcal per day. The energy intake of male students is higher that the recommended value for men - 2500 kcal per day. When the input of energy is more that output, excess energy will be converted to fats for storage. The increase in fat reservation will raise the risk in the incidence of obesity, diabetics and coronary heart disease (CHD). The total fat intake of male (35.8% of total energy intake) exceeds the recommended values (<35% of total energy intake). Therefore, the male students are advised to reduce the fat intake. Furthermore, the male group consumed cholesterol (481mg per day) more than the recommended intake (<300mg per day) by the American Heart Association, which also suggests people with high blood total cholesterol level (>200 mg/dL) should ingest less than 200mg cholesterol per day. High cholesterol intake is not the primary cause of high blood cholesterol (high fat and carbohydrate intake do) (NHLBI, 2005), but it does play a role in it and thus it's necessary to reduce the intake of food having high cholesterol level . <fnote>(BNF 2004) 33% of daily total energy intake, if including alcohol; Some standard recommend lower than 30% total energy intake </fnote>Besides, to reduce the total fat intake, male group could reduce cholesterol intake, also the saturated fat intake, from ~15% of total energy to ~10%. Alcohol consumption of both male and female groups is about 6% of total energy intake, but male' daily intake is 24.5g which is above the daily recommended value - 20g (equal to 1.5 pint beer or 2.5 glasses (312ml) of wine). Although alcohol' energy won't put on weight, young man should not drink too much because alcohol overdose can cause liver disease, gout and other diseases. Moreover, wine is beneficial to middle aged people rather than young people in reducing CHD or mortality rate (Wright 2006). Both male and female groups consumed more protein than the recommended ones. Male had 108 gram per day which the RNI is 55.5g. Female consumed 81.2g per day and the RNI is 45g. Reducing meat intake could result in reducing protein consumption dramatically; also reduce the total energy intake. <heading>Micronutrients</heading>All multi minerals and vitamins except vitamin E are within the normal recommendation consumption level. No deficiency or overdose occurs from the study. <heading>Low vitamin E consumption</heading>NDNS 2003 showed the vitamin E intake for UK male and female is 10.6mg and 8.1 mg respectively. In contrast, our study showed that male only intake 4.7 mg (mean) while female only intake 3.3mg per day. Both the level is merely more than the UK safe intake (male > 4mg; female > 3mg). Although there is extremely low incidence of vitamin E deficiency in UK, students should consider to intake more vitamin E from their diet, such as through potato, wheatgerm, nuts. <heading>Food Frequency Questionnaires method used in the study </heading>FFQ is a retrospective survey that examine the past (our study is 7 days) food nutrient intake. A food lists fill up by the subjects will be processed by the food database to generate the diet intake results for further interpretation. FFQ is a quick nutrient intake examination method that it's also inexpensive and could assess current or pass diet (Grimble 2006). However, FFQ' food list only covers the simple components of food products. If a subject intakes a variety of food, it will be hardly to fill in the FFQ. Error occurs also as subjects usually "underestimate of their intake, especially the macronutrients - carbohydrate and protein" (Paulal. 2005), also errors may come from poor memory. On the contrary, (Paulal. 2005) also claimed "subjects with higher energy intake tended to over report their intakes of protein and fat". Another error we may consider would be the number of the subjects. In our study, male group only has 23 subjects, therefore, a larger variance may appear. Thus "small number of subjects may not reliable enough" (Paulal. 2005) to represent the fact. All in all, no matter the errors would pull up or down the figures in table 1, our subjects should pay attention to the items we discussed and to make a healthy eating habit.
