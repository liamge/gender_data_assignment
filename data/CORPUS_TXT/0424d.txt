<abstract><heading>Summary</heading>This report investigates the drag force on a cylinder using the method of pressure distribution around a cylinder. A circular cylinder was immersed in the fluid air, using a large low speed wind-tunnel, in the School Of Engineering's laboratory. Three different scenarios simulating turbulent as well as laminar flow, were investigated, and the factors which affected the drag on the cylinder were investigated. The importance of the Reynolds Number of the fluid flow was also determined. The report also investigates how to reduce the effect of drag on a body, and how the process of streamlining occurs and its dependence on the magnitude of the Reynolds Number of the fluid flow. It is shown that the drag force was found to be dependent on the flow pattern of the fluid and hence the velocity and density of the fluid the body was immersed in, and the dimensions and shape of the body itself. It was concluded that the drag forces depend on the flow structure in the wake formed at the rear of the cylinder. The wider the wake is, the higher the drag forces are. The wake is formed when the flow around the cylinder separates, and the point at which this separates is determined by the Reynolds's number of the flow, which is due to a combination of the size of the body and the speed of flow. It was also deduced, that in order to reduce drag forces on a body, its shape should be designed to be as streamlined as possible, because streamlining reduces the size of the wake, hence reducing the drag force. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>The total drag on any body consists of skin friction drag and form drag. The skin friction drag is a result of the viscous forces acting on the body while the form drag is due to the unbalanced pressure forces on the body. The sum of the two is called total or profile drag. There are several methods that can be used to determine the drag forces, including prediction of drag from wake measurements and from the pressure distribution around a cylinder. The procedure used during this investigation was to measure the pressure distribution around a cylinder. Flow over a cylinder is a primary fluid mechanics problem of practical importance. The flow field over the cylinder is symmetric at low values of Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases, flow begins to separate behind the cylinder causing vortex shedding which is an unsteady phenomenon. The basic theory of fluid flow around a smooth cylinder dates back to nineteenth century hydrodynamics. The theory presented here predicts the velocity and pressure distribution about the circumference of a circular cylinder immersed in a fluid stream. The same theory predicts the lift and drag forces on the cylinder and can be applied to airfoils in modern aircraft and turbo-machinery applications. In the basic hydrodynamic theory for this experiment, the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible. The flow which is at a large distance from the immersed body is assumed to be uniform. The flow is also assumed to be irrotational. When the fluid encounters a smooth surface it is assumed to slip tangentially, owing without friction or separation; the fluid neither penetrates the surface nor leaves a gap. This condition is sufficient to yield a unique solution to the governing flow equations. This boundary condition differs from the more realistic "no slip" condition applied to viscous flows. In this experiment, the total pressure at various locations along the surface of a cylinder placed in a wind tunnel stream is measured <heading>2.0 Theory</heading><heading>Pressure Distribution In a Cylinder</heading>Figure 1 shows a cross section of a circular cylinder of radius a in a uniform stream flowing from left to right.

Similarly, the x-axis in the approaching flow, the bottom surface of the cylinder, and the x-axis of the retreating flow is another valid streamline. These two streamlines are referred to as the stagnation streamlines and wrap tightly around the cylinder as suggested in figure 1. The Bernoulli equation is valid, for steady, inviscid, incompressible flow along a streamline, and will be used to evaluate the pressure distribution along the streamline that originates far upstream where flow is undisturbed.

The quantity  FORMULA  is often called the dynamic pressure. It is the kinetic energy per unit volume of the distant stream, and is one of the terms in the Bernoulli's equation. While  FORMULA  is the static pressure of the distant stream. <heading>Drag and Lift Forces</heading>When any body moves through a fluid, an interaction between the body and fluid occurs; this effect can be described in terms of the forces at the fluid- body interface. This can be described in terms of the stresses-wall shear stress  FORMULA  due to the viscous effects and normal stresses due to pressure However there are no viscous shear stresses in the analytical model, so the total force that the fluid exerts on the cylinder is obtained by integrating the pressure force over the surface area A of the cylinder. Generally, the total force can be resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction; they are called drag, F D, and lift, F L, respectively. In the present case they are horizontal and vertical components: When the Reynolds number is sufficiently large, i.e. Re > 10 3, the skin friction drag of a bluff body is relatively negligible compared to its form drag. Then the measurement of the drag forces due to normal pressures acting the body will be a good approximation to the total drag. For a cylinder, the body lift and drag per unit length due to normal pressure only are given by:  FORMULA  Equation 9  FORMULA  Equation 10 where the integrations are taken around the contour of the cylinder. A cylindrical coordinate will be used instead, equation 10 could be re-written as:  FORMULA  Equation 11 where r is the radius of the cylinder, p is the pressure, is the angular position, and the integration is taken around the cylinder, beginning at the stagnation point. In the same manner, the lift force can be estimated as:  FORMULA  Substitutions of  FORMULA  from equation (8) into the drag and lift force equations, and then integrating, shows that F D, and F L are equal to zero(0). These results indicate that both the lift and drag force as predicted by potential theory for a fixed cylinder in a uniform stream are zero. This does not happen in real flows as will be seen from the measurements made in the laboratory That outcome is referred to as D'Alembert's paradox. It was a major point of contention in nineteenth century hydrodynamics until Ludwig Prandtl proposed his boundary layer hypothesis in 1904. This paradox is due to the omission of the influence of viscosity in the flow. In a practical sense the approach necessary to calculate the drag on the cylinder - or the drag coefficient is to measure the pressure along the entire cylinder surface and perform the integration of equation 10 using differential surface elements. The cos  FORMULA  term in the above equation (5) generates the horizontal projection of the pressure force.  FORMULA  is the actual differential pressure measured by the instrumentation in the lab and the  FORMULA  term will simply cancel out of any calculation of the drag force. <heading>Drag Coefficient (CD)</heading>Another important parameter is the drag coefficient. It is a non - dimensionless parameter, and is the result of the drag force divided by the pressure and cross-sectional area exposed to drag. It illustrates that a characteristic amount of aerodynamic drag caused by fluid flow. The equation for the drag coefficient(C D) is as follows  FORMULA  Equation 12 <fnote>Crowe, Roberson and Elger Engineering Fluid Mechanics 7th Edition John Wiley and Sons pg 486 </fnote>The graph below shows how the drag coefficient for various two-dimensional bodies. <figure/><heading>Boundary Layer and Boundary Layer Separation</heading>When a body is immersed in a fluid, near the boundary of the body, the velocity of the fluid changes rapidly from zero near the boundary ( no slip condition mentioned previously) to a relatively large value at some distance from the boundary of the body. This rapid change in velocity gives rise to a velocity gradient perpendicular to the boundary. Theoretically with invicid fluids, the fluid would just slide past the boundary and flow would be irrotational everywhere. This is however not the case with real fluids. There is typically a layer near a fixed surface in the fluid stream in which shearing stresses occur. This layer is called the boundary layer. A possible consequence of the boundary layer is that the main stream may 'separate' from the surface and form a wake downstream from the body. (See figure 8) <heading>3.0 Apparatus and Method</heading><heading>Apparatus</heading><heading>Wind-Tunnel</heading>The experiment was carried out in the large low-speed wind tunnel in the department of Engineering. The cross-sectional area of the working area of the wind-tunnel is approximately 1.04m x 1.37m. Pictures can be seen in appendix D <heading>Cylinder</heading>A circular cylinder with a diameter d=113mm is mounted horizontally in the working section of the wind-tunnel. It extends from one side-wall of the working section to another. At about the central cross-section of the cylinder there are 13 static pressure tappings in its surface. The front of the tappings  FORMULA  is aligned to the free stream direction. The rest are distributed at  FORMULA  intervals. The thirteenth tapping  FORMULA  is located at the rear. It is assumed that the pressure readings are the same for the bottom surface of the cylinder as the top pressure readings <picture/><heading>Multi-water manometer. </heading>The static tappings are connected to 13 adjacent tubes of a multi - water manometer which is used to measure the pressure at different points on the surface of the cylinder <heading>Pitot-Static Probe </heading>A pitot probe can be used in the wind tunnel to measure the velocity of the tunnel. The assumption made is that the static pressure is constant everywhere in a uniform free-stream inside the wind tunnel. This is a reasonable assumption considering that there is no pressure loss, therefore, no pressure gradient, in the system. However, the situation will be very different for measurements taken inside a wake behind a bluff body where a significant amount of pressure variation exists across the wake profile. In order to accurately determine the velocity profile in the wake, a pitot-static tube is used. The pitot-static tube, a sketch of which is shown in Figure 4 a combination of the static tube and the pitot tube, it works in the following manner  FORMULA  Equation 13 where V is flow velocity, is the density of the fluid, p stag is the stagnation pressure of the free-stream and p stat is the static pressure The probe is located in the undisturbed flow upstream of the cylinder and is connected to the manometer to measure the free-stream static pressure. It is also connected to a micro-manometer to measure the tunnel air speed. <picture/><heading>Wire Mesh</heading>This is mounted on the test section about 3 diameters upstream of the cylinder. It is used to introduce disturbances into the flow and thus simulate the effect of a fluid with a higher Reynolds number, by increasing the free-stream turbulence. This results in triggering an earlier laminar-turbulent transition of the boundary layer on the surface of the cylinder. <heading>Procedure</heading>The first run of the experiment is conducted with the wire mesh securely inserted in the tunnel upstream of the cylinder, to insure conditions of turbulent separation, and with the tunnel at maximum speed. The pressure at the different angles is measured by reading off the levels of the water in each tube of the manometer. The results are recorded in a table. The tunnel speed is also read and recorded. The experiment is repeated two more times with the wire mesh removed from the tunnel. The second run is at full speed while the third run is at half speed. <heading>4.0 Table of Results</heading><table/><heading>5.0 Analysis and Discussion of Results</heading>Using values obtained during the experiment, the Reynolds number of the flows is calculated. By calculating the Reynolds Number of the flows, the boundary layer conditions of the flow can be determined. i.e.( whether the flow is turbulent or laminar) <heading>A.

A clearer version of the graphs can be seen in Appendix A-C  FORMULA  <figure/><figure/><figure/>The computer program CYL15 computes the 13 manometer readings with the aid of Matlab based on the equation to evaluate the pressure coefficient-  FORMULA  With the aid of the graph, one is able to determine the value of theta at which the flow separates in each case. This is possible because when separation occurs, the flow pattern is no longer that of irrotational flow. In accordance, there are changes in the pressure distribution. That is, the experimental pressure distribution begins to deviate from the theoretical pressure distribution. Therefore the flow begins to separate at approximately Theta equals <list>Full Speed with mesh -125 degreesFull Speed without mesh- 67 degreesHalf Speed without mesh- 60 degrees </list>Separation usually occurs where the physical boundary turns away from the main stream of flow. Considering the flow of a viscous fluid past a circular cylinder, shown the diagram below <picture/>The flow upstream of the midsection of the cylinder is similar to that of irrotational flow about a cylinder, except very close to the boundary surface. At this point because of a viscous resistance, a thin layer of fluid has its velocity reduced from that predicted by the irrotational theory. The fluid particles directly adjacent to the surface actually have zero velocity. (This is called the no-slip condition.) The normal tendency is for the layer of reduced velocity (called the Boundary Layer) to grow in thickness in the direction of flow. However, because the main stream of fluid outside the boundary layer is accelerating in the same direction the boundary layer remains quite thin up to approximately the mid section. The boundary thick ness is usually defined as that thickness where the flow velocity reaches 99% of the free stream value U 0 Upstream of the midsection the irrotational flow pattern shows a significant deceleration of the fluid next to the boundary, with a corresponding increaser in pressure. For real flow however, the deceleration of the fluid next to the boundary is limited because its velocity is already small ( much smaller than the theoretical flow ) because of viscous resistance. Therefore the fluid near the boundary can proceed only a very short distance against the adverse pressure gradient. The adverse pressure gradient is the increase in pressure in the direction of flow along the rear half of the cylinder. Once the motion of the fluid next to the boundary ceases, this causes the main stream of flow to be directed away or 'separated' from the boundary.Thus the process of separation is produced. The location of the point of separation for a cylinder depends on the character of the flow in the boundary layer. It may also depend on the shape and roughness if the body. The Reynolds number is also an indication of the onset of separation. For Reynolds number greater than 50, the entire flow field is dominated by relatively large viscous stresses that inhibit the development of eddy motion in the flow When separation occurs the flow pattern is changed from that of the theoretical flow. The corresponding changes in the pressure distribution occur. For flow past a cylinder, the slight change of the flow pattern next to the forward part of the body only changes the pressure distribution slightly. However in the zone of separation, marked changes occur. From the previous graphs (figs 4-6) it can be seen that the experimental distribution that is nearest to that of the ideal distribution is that of the turbulent flow at full speed. It also indicates that the average pressure on the rear half of the cylinder is considerably less than that on the front half. Thus a large pressure drag is developed, even though the viscous shear drag maybe quite small. This explained D'Alembert's paradox. No matter how small the viscosity, provided it is not zero, there will be a boundary layer that separates the surface giving a drag force. Compared to a laminar boundary layer, a turbulent one has more kinetic energy and momentum. Therefore the turbulent boundary layer can flow farther around the cylinder before it separates than the laminar boundary layer. Over the front surface of the cylinder the presence of the boundary layer affects the pressure distribution through two major ways. Firstly through viscous losses and secondly through a slight displacement caused by the retardation of flow within the boundary layer. Near the shoulder where  FORMULA  the pressure gradient changes from being negative to being positive. The force due to pressure differences changes sign from being an accelerating force to being a retarding force. In response the flow slows down. Mathematically we could say that inviscid flow cannot satisfy the boundary conditions to real flow, specifically inviscid flows allow slip at the surface while viscous flows do not. <heading>Drag Coefficients</heading>The drag coefficients for all the flows are shown on top of the graphs (figures 4-6). It is Computed from the graphs shown below (which is the graphs of Cp against sin  FORMULA using equations in Appendix(E) for the appropriate experimental condition. <figure/><figure/><figure/>The drag coefficient goes from 0.369 for turbulent flow to 1.56 for laminar flow. This is similar to the graph in figure 2. The drag coefficient suddenly drops from about 1.2 to 0.3 at a critical Reynolds number of approximately between 10 5 and 10 6 This reduction in C D at a Reynolds number of approximately 10 5 is due to a change in the flow pattern triggered by a change in the character at the boundary layer. For Reynolds numbers less than 10 5 flow is laminar, and separation occurs about halfway between the upstream side and the downstream side of the cylinder. Therefore, the entire downstream side of the cylinder is exposed to relatively low pressure, which in turns produces a relatively high value for C D. When the Reynolds number is increased to about 10 5, the boundary layer becomes turbulent in nature. This causes higher velocity fluid to be mixed in the region close to the wall of the cylinder. As an effect of the presence of this high-velocity, high-momentum fluid in the boundary layer, the flow proceeds farther downstream along the surface of the cylinder against adverse pressure before separation occurs. ( Figure 8) Hence the flow pattern, i.e. delayed separation causes the drag to be reduced for the following reasons; with the turbulent boundary layer, the streamlines downstream of the cylinder midsection diverge somewhat before separation, and hence a decrease in velocity occurs before separation. According to Bernoulli's equation, the decrease in velocity produces a pressure at the point of separation that is greater than the pressure at the midsection. Therefore at the point of separation, and also in the zone of separation, the pressure is significantly greater under these conditions than when separation occurs farther upstream. Thus the pressure difference between the upstream and downstream surfaces of the cylinder is less at high values of the Reynolds Number, yielding a lower drag coefficient. Apart from being dependent on the Reynolds number, the drag coefficient is also dependent on shape as well as surface roughness. It must be noted however that the drag coefficient produced during this experiment is not the total one. This is because the drag force used to compute C D, is not the total drag force, produced. It is only one component of the total drag called the pressure drag also known as form drag. Usually the total drag force is made up of both the form drag and the viscous drag also known as frictional drag. However, because as discussed earlier in the theory sections , the viscous drag is associated with the viscous shear forces. But there are assumed to be no viscous shear stresses in the analytical model, so the total force that the fluid exerts on the cylinder is obtained by integrating the pressure force over the surface area A of the cylinder <heading>Streamlining- A method to reduce Drag</heading>Streamlining is a method used to reduce drag. It reduces the extreme curvature on the downstream of a body, reducing or eliminating separation in the process. Therefore, the coefficient of drag is greatly reduced. It also removes the periodic formation of vortices. When a body is streamlined by elongating it and reducing its curvature, the pressure drag is reduced. However the viscous drag is increased because there is a greater amount of the surface of the streamlined body, than on the un-streamlined body. Consequently, when a body is streamlined to produce minimal drag, there is an optimum condition to be required. This condition occurs when the sum of the surface drag and pressure drag is minimum. It should be noted that streamlining to produce minimum drag at high Reynolds numbers will probably not produce minimum drag at low Reynolds numbers. For Reynolds number less than one , the majority of the drag of a body is due to the viscous shear stress on the wall of the body. Hence if the body is streamlined, the viscous shear stress is simply magnified and the C D may actually increase for this range of Reynolds numbers where the viscous resistance is predominant. <heading>6.0 Conclusions</heading>From the experimental data gathered, it can be concluded that when a blunt object like a cylinder is immersed in a fluid, the magnitude of the drag forces due to the flow, depends on a number of factors. Firstly, the drag force depends on the Reynolds number of the fluid. The larger the Reynolds number of the flow, the more turbulent the flow is. However, contrary to expectations, the higher the Reynolds number, the lower the coefficient of drag. At low Reynolds number flow, (Re< 1), the drag is a function of upstream velocity. At moderate Reynolds number (10 3<Re<10 5) flows the drag coefficient tends to decrease slightly with Reynolds number. However at high Reynolds numbers (10 5<Re<10 6) there is a sudden decrease in the drag force. This is due to the fact that a turbulent boundary layer, can travel farther along the surface into the adverse pressure gradient on the rear portion of the cylinder before separation occurs .This results in a smaller wake and hence a smaller pressure drag. Due to the fact that the drag force is dependent on the Reynolds number of the flow, it could be deduced that it is therefore dependent on a combination of the size of the object and the speed and density of the fluid flow. To reduce drag forces on an object, the flow must be made to separate as late as possible. This can be done by redesigning the object into a shape that is more streamlined. It should be noted however that there are limitations to streamlining. At low Reynolds number flows, streamlining can actually increase in the areas on which shear forces act. .
