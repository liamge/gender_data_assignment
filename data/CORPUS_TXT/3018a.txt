<heading>Introduction</heading>On the 26 th August, Bank holiday Monday, Mr. Lars Hanson has arranged to host a party to celebrate his 25 th wedding anniversary. The location is at his riverside house with the marquee erected on the lawn next to the river. He requires a three course luncheon with wine starting at 1pm. The guests will arrive from 11.30am and will leave around 3.30pm. He has contacted Peacock Catering and asked for a quote for the day including the following: <list>Hot canapés and drinks on arrivalA three course lunch menu including wine listA selection of drinks including water and wine that will be available all dayThe cutting and distribution of the wedding cake along with champagne for the speechesA recommended table plan for the dayA list of all the china, glassware and equipment required for the dayThe wording for the menu and wine list</list>The structure of the report is based around the guidelines set out in requirement of Mr. Lars Hanson. First, it was necessary to consider the style of service of the day and the type of menu for luncheon. Once these were decided upon, the report also needed to include the costing of the food and beverage package, a staff roster and equipment and glassware required. Moreover, a plan is needed to maintain effective quality control of products and services. This will ensure the whole event runs smoothly. <picture/><heading>Service Style</heading><heading>The Style of the Event</heading>At 11.30am hot canapés and drinks will be served on salvers by staff as the guests arrive. The guests are seated at 1.00pm and served a three course lunch. The lunch will be plated and served to the guests at the table. Wine waiters will serve the guests drink throughout the meal, although bottled water will be placed on the tables. After the meal liqueurs and brandy will be available to the guests. The cake will be cut during the meal and served to the guests with their coffee that will be placed on each table for them to self serve. Cups and all the necessary accomplishments will have been placed on the table after dessert has been cleared. Champagne will be served to all the guests by the wine waiters before the speeches. Due to the nature of the occasion and the number of guests, we decided the most effective way of service was 'A la carte' as it is a formal style of service suitable for the market type; it will also be fast and efficient style of service. All the food will be plated from kitchen and served to the table. The number of staff available to serve will enable an effective service. <heading>The layout </heading>As Peacock Catering can only enter the property at 9.30am the morning of the party, the layout needed to be something that was easy to set up in a fast amount of time but still look pleasant. The top table is placed at the far left end of the marquee and then seven tables of six placed evenly over the marquee. Screens will be placed over the doors to both the cloakroom and the kitchen to prevent the guests being able see into them. Due to the nature of the layout there will be a space at the far right end of the marquee where the guests will enter. This was deliberately done to enable a welcoming area where guests can have their welcome drinks and generally wait without being cluttered around the tables. The bar will be placed in the lower right corner. It will not be in the way during service but is useful for the drinks reception at the start as the bar will be nearest to the guests.

Because the service style is 'a la carte', the choice of the dishes needs to be easy to serve. The presentation of the dish will give the guests a surprise. <heading>Crab mousse salad avocado with apple champagne dressing</heading>A simple crab mousse with a cheese garnish and avocado. The dressing will be a perfect match for the mousse <heading>Summer in Greece</heading>The idea came from the Greek salad, beside the tofu. Crumbly feta cheese is added in to this dish as a garnish as it will increase the flavour and texture of the tofu. <heading>Roast Duck Breast with Mango chilli Salsa</heading>A mixed recipe here; a simple roast duck breast with the Mango chilli salsa to add a kick to the dish. <heading>Grilled Courgette Boat stuffed with Mixed Mushroom Risotto</heading>A very popular vegetarian dish; stuffed with risotto of mixed mushroom like wild and oyster mushrooms. <heading>Asparagus Polonaise</heading>Asparagus with a breadcrumb sauce, garnished with crush eggs, parsley and chives. <heading>Duchess Potatoes</heading>Smooth mash potato piped out into spiral shapes.

(Merricks, P.1986). Peacock catering has selected Cash & Carry for their purchasing requirement. As it is one off event. Food and drink will be collected and transported to the storage area three days before the events. The management team will do a final check the day before the event. All food needs to be stored in the fridge until preparation except dry store food which should be stored on shelves in a dry store area off the ground. The drinks will need to be stored; champagne and white wines will need to be stored in a refrigerator, red wines in a wine rack off the ground; the rest of the soft drinks should be stored at in their original packaging, unopened and off the ground. The storage area must be clean, and free from dust and at the correct room temperatures for storage of red wines and foods. Storage at the event should be the same. Both the Food and Drink should be transported the day before so that it can be insurance that everything is there. <heading>Restaurant Ser vice </heading>All waiters will have full menu knowledge and understand the basic ingredients of each dish so that they can answer any of the guests enquire. Waiters will be told roughly how many canapés there are per person so that they know when to restock their salvers or when to wait for new guests before serving again. All waiters are qualified with at least NVQ Level 2 in restaurant service or above, during the event, there will be a supervisor to ensure quality standards are kept to. <heading>Bar service</heading>Bin cards and monitoring of drinks sold - as this is an account bar it is important to monitor what is being sold to the customer, so once a bottle of wine has been used it must be logged on a card. (Please see appendix E) Empty bottles of wine should be kept behind so that they can be counted at the end of the day to make sure that the figures all agree. Serving the drinks - Cocktails and non alcoholic cocktails will be pre-prepared for when the customers arrive there will be enough for one each, the cocktails will be served from trays to the customers, once everyone has a cocktail we shall make up some more and ask the guests it they would like another glass. Coffee and tea shall be readily available at the bar and if a customer asks for some on arrival it shall be served to them. Champagnes, wines, coffees and liquors shall be served to the customers at the table. Empty bottles and cups and glasses shall be cleared from the tables and a fresh glass shall be used for each drink at the bar, where the customer is drinking the same wine at the table glasses can be refilled by the wine waiter. <heading>Kitchen</heading>Standard recipes are designed to ensure dish quality and should provide details of both ingredients and methods. (Please see appendix F) All food leaving kitchen should be above 63 degrees. This can be checked using the temperature probe. Head chef to check and taste all food before leave to kitchen to ensure the correct presentation Take samples of all food to be serving to the guests. <heading>Staff Rota</heading><heading>Kitchen Staff </heading>Due to the size of the kitchen and the nature of the food, the majority of the food preparation will be done the day before in a central kitchen. The Sunday rota is simple only needing two chefs and a kitchen porter to clear up. This will enable them to do the bulk of the preparation. The food will then be transported to the site on the Monday morning in refrigerated vans. The Monday rota only has three chefs on. Two of these will finalise any preparation that needs doing during the morning and the 3 rd chef will join them to help with service. It may seem that 3 chefs is a lot for only 50 guests but it will enable more effective service throughout the day. (Please see appendix G) <heading>Servers Staff</heading>Peacock Catering is allowed entry into the property at 9.30am. The marquee will need to be set up for the day. This will include the laying of tables, polishing all the glasses and generally setting up for the day. The rota includes both food and drink waiters although their duties vary.
