A control box provided the manual adjustment of the braking torque and displayed the speed, torque, mechanical power, current, power factor and electrical power input. The load or torque was varied from 0 to a value when the motor stopped running (4.5 N/m). The consequent data was noted from the display. Graphs of torque against speed and efficiency against mechanical power were plotted. Using the data and the graphs, it was concluded that the torque has a non-linear and inverse relationship with the speed of the motor. The second graph showed the efficiency was directly proportional to the mechanical power and that the efficiency of the motor at the rated load is the maximum efficiency for that motor (69%). The power factor at no load was found out to be 0.25 and at full load it was 0.84. The rated values of the motor occurred when the torque was 2.0 N/m. Also, a current probe and oscilloscope were used to get the graphs of current against time for the inductive motor at full load and at no load. The peak starting current of the motor in both cases was 5 A. It was observed that at full load, the motor took a much longer time to reach the operating speed (200 ms) than when it was at no load (100 ms). </abstract><heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>A system 1 is a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole. An electrical power system comprises of characteristics such as speed, current, voltage, mechanical power, power factor and torque. These are interrelated i.e. a change in one brings about changes in the rest of the attributes. The purpose of this laboratory was to help understand the relationship between the above characteristics, to analyse the performance of a small three-phase induction motor and measure its torque and mechanical power. The three-phase induction motor was connected to a dynamometer (an electrically-controlled brake) and a tachometer (an electrical speed measuring device. Different torque measurements were taken and the corresponding values of measured speed, current, calculated mechanical power and power factor were recorded. Graphs were plotted to investigate the relationship between the torque and speed of the motor, as well as its efficiency and mechanical power with different loads. The time taken by the motor to reach its operating speed was observed and compared with varying loads applied to it. It was deduced that at no load the motor took least time to reach its operating speed from its original speed, while it took a large amount of time to do the same with a large load. <heading>THEORY</heading>The laboratory was significantly involved with the functioning of the induction motor as well as the concept of power factor. The theories are explained below. <heading>Alternating current and three-phase induction motor2 </heading>Alternating current (AC) is an electric current that repeatedly changes polarity from negative to positive and back again. The most commonly used form of alternating current does so in a sine wave pattern as shown in Fig. 1. Instead of current as a function of time it shows an alternating voltage, but an alternating current follows the exact trend as a sine wave. <figure/>Alternating current motors are generally available as single phase or three phase motors. The currents produced are sinusoidal functions of time, all at the same frequency but with different phases. In a three-phase system the phases are spaced equally, separated from each other by 120Â°. The three phase (or polyphase) AC induction motor is used for high-power applications. This uses the phase differences between the three phases to create a rotating electromagnetic field in the motor. Through electromagnetic induction the rotating magnetic field induces current to flow in the copper conductors in the rotor, which in turn sets up a counterbalancing magnetic field and this causes the motor to turn in the direction the field is rotating. This type of motor is known as an induction motor. In order for it to operate it must always run slower than the frequency of the power supply feeding it causes the magnetic field in the motor to rotate, otherwise no counterbalancing field is produced in the rotor. AC motor speed primarily depends on the frequency of the AC supply and the amount of slip, or difference in rotation between the rotor and stator fields, determines the torque that the motor produces. <heading>Power factor (()4</heading>In alternating current power transmission, the power factor is the ratio of power to volt-amperes. In the simplest case, when the voltage and current are both sinusoidal, the power factor () is equal to the cosine of the phase angle between voltage and current. <figure/>By definition, the power factor is a dimensionless number between -1 and +1. Instead of positive and negative values, the terms leading and lagging are used. When the load is resistive, the power delivered to it is equal to the product of volts and amperes, so the power factor is unity. When the load is inductive, such as in the induction motor used in this laboratory, the current lags the applied voltage (as shown in Fig.2), and the power factor is said to be a lagging power factor. A power transmission system is working at its greatest efficiency when the power factor is unity. When the power factor is less than unity, the transmission losses increase and the system capacity is reduced. <heading>APPARATUS AND METHODS</heading><heading>Apparatus 5 :</heading><list>Electrical power test panel (Feedback):<list>Control unit: Three-phase supply control unit, ref. 60-100Supply unit: Variable and three-phase/dc supply 5A, ref. 60-125Measuring unit: Single and three-phase measurement unit, ref. 68-100</list>Electrical machines test bed (Leroy Somer):<list>Induction motor rates at 0.3 kW 50 Hz 1440 rpm (Delta-connected: 220 V 1.75 A, Star-connected 380 V 1.00 A)Tachometer and powder brake dynamometer (Leroy Somer Modmeca), rated at 300 W for 15 min, 500 W for 5 min and equipped with overload trip.</list>Oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 210)Current probe Lem Heme 20 Amax, 100 mV/AConnecting leads 9, 4 mm to 4 mm with shrouded connectors</list><heading>Method 5 :</heading><heading>Preparation</heading>The voltage, current, speed and power ratings of the motor are noted down. The measuring unit is set up as shown in the figures on page 11 of the laboratory handout. The measuring unit is switched on and the meter on the display is set to page 4, which shows 'V L1, L2, L3', showing the voltages on the lines that are connected. (D) is switched off and the variable output knob is turned off. The output voltage selector is set to three phase mode or 1. L1, L2, L3 and N are connected to the measuring unit. (B) and (D) are switched on next and the variable output is turned to 25%. The values of the voltages are noted down from the display unit. The measurement display is turned back to page 1, and it is observed that the voltage displayed on this page is large since it is the average of the three voltage lines and the value is 3 times the actual value. The line-to-line voltage is then increased till the display shows the rated motor voltage, 380 V. (D) is then switched off. The terminals L1, L2, L3 are connected to U1, V1, W1 respectively. (D) is switched on again. <heading>Torque and efficiency: Measurements</heading>After switching on (D), the motor is running without any load. The dynamometer is set for manual control of torque and it is initialised to zero. The speed range is set to 2000 /min and power to 300 W. The values of torque, speed, mechanical power, current, power factor and electrical power input are noted down for every 0.5 Nm increase in torque till the power output reaches 300 W. Beyond this, the measurements are taken quickly in order to avoid damage to the insulation. The motor is switched off immediately after it stops. This motor stops running when the load is too large. <heading>Analysis of Results</heading>A graph is plotted for torque against speed (Refer to Graph A). The percentage efficiency is calculated for each load using the formula efficiency = (mechanical power output / electrical power in) x 100 A graph of efficiency against mechanical power is also plotted (Refer to Graph B). The point corresponding to the rated power output for the motor is marked on it. <heading>Starting current of the motor</heading>The motor is switched off by switching off (D). The oscilloscope is switched on. The current probe, measuring the magnetic flux around the conductor, is clipped onto the lead connected to Ch 1 and is switched on. The voltage output given by the probe is to be displayed on the oscilloscope with a scale factor 100 mV/A. The oscilloscope is adjusted to 1 Volts/div = 200 mV with a timebase sec/div = 50 msec for Ch 1. The acquire button is pressed and it is set to peak detect. The trigger button is then pressed and on the trigger menu, the mode is set to single and slope is set to rising. The trigger level knob is used to set the trigger level to 200 mV. The run/stop button is pressed to change the oscilloscope to armed or ready. The motor is then switched on and the oscilloscope shows a current wave. A printout is taken of the graph (Graph C) after pressing autoset. Another printout is taken out with the motor on full load (Graph D). The current probe is then switched off. <heading>OBSERVATIONS, CALCULATIONS AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS</heading>The ratings of the motor are as follows: <table/>In the preparation, the values of L1, L2 and L3 along with the voltage value from page 1 of the display are taken down as: <table/>Voltage from page 1: 114 V = 3 of the average of the three lines = 3 x 65.8 V The following are the recorded values of torque, speed, current, power factor, electrical power and mechanical power while a varying load is applied to the motor: <table/>When the torque equals 4.5 N/m, the motor stops working. No electrical power is detected at this instance. Hence, the values at this load can be ignored. The efficiencies of the motor with different loads are calculated using the formula efficiency = (mechanical power output / electrical power in) x 100 as follows: <table/>The graph of torque against speed (Refer to Graph A) is plotted. It is observed from the graph, that the speed of the motor is maximum at no-load. Hence, it decreases considerably with the increasing torque. Thus, torque and speed have a non-linear inverse relationship. The graph of efficiency against mechanical power (Refer to Graph B) is plotted. The graph shows that they have a non-linear relation and are directly proportional to each other till a certain value, after which the efficiency of the motor starts to fall. This value is the rated mechanical power value for the motor. Hence, the rated value is the point of maximum efficiency for the motor (69%). It can be deduced that running the motor to drive small loads becomes disadvantageous since the efficiency is not maximised. There is more loss of energy at low loads. Observing the power factor from Table 1 shows that it equals 0.25 at no load and equals 0.84 at maximum load. This means that the current lag decreases as the load is increased. Comparing the test results in Table 1 with the ratings of the motor shows that the values approximately correspond to when the torque = 2.0 N/m. Hence, it can be concluded that the motor becomes unfit to work beyond this value of torque. Comparing the graphs of the current against time from the oscilloscope (Graph C and Graph D) shows that the peak starting current of both instances equals 5 Amps. But, the motor takes extremely long to reach the operating speed when it is on full load (200 ms) and takes a small amount of time when it is on no load (100 ms). <heading>CONCLUSION</heading>The aim of the experiment was to investigate the relationship between the characteristics of a three-phase induction motor. It also analysed the performance of the motor and measured its torque and mechanical power. As seen from the results and the graphs, the torque is inversely proportional to the speed of the motor. The efficiency, on the other hand, is directly proportional to the mechanical power. Also, the motor takes more time to reach the operating speed from start at full load as compared to no load.
