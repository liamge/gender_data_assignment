<abstract><heading>Summary</heading>In this investigation a 'PLINT limited' centrifugal pump was tested at different speeds and deliver pressures in order to determine the Pump Performance Characteristics. This was done by varying the delivery pressure, and measuring the suction pressure, the force exerted by the pump and the discharge rate of the pump. This collection of data was enough to determine and analyse such factors as efficiency. Two different speeds of 2000rpm and 3000rpm were tested. Varying the delivery pressure at a constant rate over the pump's complete operating range yielded about 10 results in each speed situation. The results were then put into a spreadsheet in order to calculate the values that we wished to analyse. Two sets of graphs were then plotted. The first of these was of the Pump Performance Characteristics of the pump and displayed Discharge, Total Head, Efficiency and Input Power. The second of these was of the Non-Dimensional Results derived. Some useful information was obtained from looking at these graphs. Firstly, the characteristics of the pump were very similar at the two different speeds. They were similar due to the forms and gradients of the graphs being very close to one another. Secondly, it was discovered that the pump would run up to 8% more efficiently at 3000rpm than at 2000rpm. Finally, that for the non-dimensional results, if speed were to be increased then and would theoretically move closer together. It was seen that this sort of investigation into centrifugal pump performance characteristics is extremely useful in analysing how well a pump will work in certain situations. The graphs derived would be invaluable in a situation where you had to pick a pump to be used in a system. For example, you could use them to determine what speed and power intake you would need in order to get a particular discharge. Overall, the techniques used in this investigation and their results are a versatile tool in analysing the performance of pumps. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>In this investigation a 'PLINT limited' centrifugal pump will be tested at different speeds and deliver pressures in order to determine the Pump Performance Characteristics. This will be done by varying the delivery pressure, and measuring the suction pressure, the force exerted by the pump and the discharge rate of the pump. This collection of data will be enough to determine and analyse such factors as efficiency. <heading>Apparatus and Method</heading>The pump being tested is a single stage centrifugal pump made by PLINT Limited. It will be tested at speeds of 2000 and 3000 rpm. Four measurements were taken from the pump: the suction pressure, the delivery pressure, force given by the pump, and the discharge. The suction pressure and the delivery pressure were recorded from analogue dials. The force given by the pump was recorded from a spring balance. Before collecting this data the extension from the pump had to be centred in order to ensure that the system was in equilibrium without resting on other supports. If the shaft were to be resting on a shaft then the force measurement would be incorrect by a significant amount. This situation is illustrated below. <picture/>The discharge was recorded using a Venturi Manometer. When measuring, the most extreme measurements of delivery pressure were taken first of all in order to determine in which range measurements needed to be taken. It was decided within the group to take about 10 measurements within each range. For 2000 rpm the most extreme delivery pressures were 0.49 bar and 0.13 bar, so it was decided to take measurements every 0.05 bar from 0.45 bar to 0.15 bar. For 3000 rpm the most extreme delivery pressures were 1.30 bar and 0.40 bar, so it was decided to take measurements every 0.10 bar from 1.30 bar to 0.40 bar. When recording the force and the discharge, taking measurements at a level perpendicular to the reading reduced systematic errors in the form of parallax errors. <heading>Theory</heading>Centrifugal pump definition from ' URL ': <quote>[A centrifugal pump is] A pump consisting of an impeller fixed on a rotating shaft and enclosed in a casing or volute and having an inlet and a discharge connection.

The first two graphs are of the 'Pump Performance Characteristics'. These have been plotted on two different graphs for speeds of 2000 rpm and 3000 rpm, so as to stop any confusion between which results relate to which speeds. The third graph illustrates the 'Non-Dimensional Results' as calculated in the table. Both speeds have been illustrated on the same graph, due to the fact that there are 4 sets of points, compared to 6 in the performance characteristics graphs. Therefore, there is less chance of there being any confusion. These three graphs are shown in Appendices 2, 3, and 4 respectively. <heading>Evaluation of Results</heading>When the pump is running at 2000rpm the performance characteristics, as displayed by Graph 1, are as follows. Efficiency is a parabolic curve in which the maximum value of around 23.5% efficiency occurs at 0.9 litres sec-1 flow rate. Total head decreases at a constant rate as discharge increases, until discharge reaches 0.9 litres sec-1, at which point the total head starts decreasing at an increasing rate. Input power increases at a constant rate almost throughout. When the pump is running at 3000rpm the performance characteristics, as displayed by Graph 2, are as follows. Efficiency is a parabolic curve in which the maximum value of around 31.5% efficiency occurs at 1.2 litres sec-1 flow rate. Total head decreases at an increasing rate. However, it is fairly linear between 0 litres sec-1 and 0.9 litres sec-1 flow rate. Input power increases at a constant rate almost throughout. It is now possible to compare performance characteristics for when the pump is running at the two different speeds. At speeds of 3000rpm the pump has a maximum efficiency of 8% more than when it is running at 2000rpm. However, efficiencies are the same as each other for flow speeds of up to 0.4 litres sec-1. The total head decreases at the same rate at each speed when compared to the range of the flow rate. For example, if you stretched out the curve for 2000rpm, it would look like 3000rpm to quite a high extent. This suggests that if you tested another speed then its total head would also act in the same way as compared to its range of flow rate. Input power at 3000rpm increases at a faster rate than for 2000rpm. This means that for the same increase in flow rate, a greater power input increase is needed for higher speeds. In order to analyse Graph 3, which displays the 'Non-dimensional results', we can consider that the non-dimensional results represent coefficients of the variables within them, and therefore the non-dimensional results change in proportion to the variables, as discussed below.  FORMULA  decreases at an almost constant rate. This is because delivery pressure is the variable that is changed at a constant rate during the experiment. The only other variable in the equation, which forms ?P, is the suction pressure. The suction pressure also changes at a constant rate. This non-dimensional will therefore change at a constant rate because ?P changes at a constant rate.  FORMULA  increases at a decreasing rate. This is because discharge, Q, increases at a decreasing rate.  FORMULA  increases at a decreasing rate. This is because force increases at a decreasing rate, which means that torque, T, increases at a decreasing rate. It can be seen from Graph 3 that for 3000rpm is larger than for 2000rpm. However, for 3000rpm is smaller than for 2000rpm. This indicates, due to the layout of the graph axes that as the speed increases the values of the non-dimensional numbers and will move closer together. However, the speed would have to increase by a very significant amount for them to have the same value. There are some possible sources of random error in this experiment, which may account for any anomalies within the data. Firstly, due to the fact that the delivery pressure and suction pressure were displayed on analogue dials, they may have not been recorded accurately, due to the spacing between numbers of the dial being wide. This therefore means that the values of the pressures can only really be measured effectively to 0.05, when sometimes the pointer may have been in-between these points. A way to rectify this would be to increase the number of markings on the dials. Secondly, when moving the extension to the pump in the measuring of the force, then it may not have been centred correctly, thereby inducing small errors. There are also some possible sources of systematic error in this experiment. However, because they are systematic we may not actually know about them. For example, there was one calibration error noticed on the Venturi Manometer when measuring for speeds of 3000rpm. For the first couple of readings the manometer read - 4, when it should have been 0. The results were calibrated by increasing each value by 4, therefore virtually calibrating the manometer readings. <heading>Conclusions</heading>In this investigation into the performance characteristics of a centrifugal pump at different speeds many things were realised. Firstly, it was seen that at the two different speeds the characteristics were very similar. They were similar due to the forms and gradients of the graphs being very close to one another. However, small differences still existed such as the spread of the results and slight variations in gradient, such as with input power in Graphs 1 and 2, where for Graph 2 it has a slightly steeper gradient than in Graph 1. It was also discovered that the pump would run up to 8% more efficiently at 3000rpm than at 2000rpm. Secondly, it was seen that in Graph 3, for the non-dimensional results, if speed were to be increased then and would theoretically move closer together. It can be seen that this sort of investigation into centrifugal pump performance characteristics is extremely useful in analysing how well a pump will work in certain situations. The graphs derived would be invaluable in a situation where you had to pick a pump to be used in a system. For example, you could use them to determine what speed and power intake you would need in order to get a particular discharge. Overall, the techniques used in this investigation and their results are a versatile tool in analysing the performance of pumps.
