<heading>Q(a) Identify the three sample plans which are specified for your combination of Code Letter and AQL (i.e. normal inspection, tightened inspection and reduced inspection). </heading>As being allocated, my Code Letter and AQL are M and 0.65 respectively. Referring to the tables shown on page 42 of the module booklet, three single sample plans can be identified which are specified for my combination of Code Letter and AQL. As displayed in a table below: <table/><heading>Q(b) Plot 3 OC curves on a single graph. </heading><heading>Calculation for OC curve of normal inspection:</heading>Referring to the acceptance number, the rejection number and the sample size of the normal inspection plan above, the percentage of defectives in the sample lying between the acceptance number and rejection number is calculated to be around 2%, i.e. (5.5/315)*100%≈2%.Consequently, a series of percentages of defectives is set up as: 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%, 4.5% and 5.0%. As the sample size is 315, the values of a (i.e. the number of defectives) are calculated to be: 0, 1.6, 3.2, 4.7, 6.3, 7.9, 9.5, 11.0, 12.6, 14.2, 15.8. As the acceptance number is 5, the probability of the number of defectives being less than or equal to 5 are then calculated by excel as shown below (i.e. the sum of P(0), P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) and P(5) for each of the "a" values): <table/><heading>Calculation of OC curve of tightened inspection:</heading>As the sample size of tightened inspection is the same as that of normal inspection, based on the same series of percentages of defectives applied in normal inspection, the values of a (i.e. number of defectives) will remain the same for tightened inspection as well. As the acceptance number is 3, the probability of the number of defectives being less than or equal to 3 are then calculated by excel as shown below: (i.e. the sum of P(0), P(1), P(2), P(3) for each of the "a" values): <table/><heading>Calculation of OC curve of reduced inspection:</heading>Referring to the acceptance number, the rejection number and the sample size of the reduced inspection plan above, the percentage of defectives in the sample lying between the acceptance number and rejection number is calculated to be around 2.8%, i.e. (3.5/125)*100%≈2.8%. Consequently, a series of percentages of defectives can be set up as the same as that of normal inspection, which is 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%, 4.5% and 5.0%. As the sample size is 125, the values of a (i.e. the number of defectives) are then calculated to be: 0, 0.625, 1.25, 1.875, 2.5, 3.125, 3.75, 4.375, 5, 5.625, 6.25. As the acceptance number is 3, the probability of the number of defectives being less than or equal to 3 are then calculated by excel as shown below: (i.e. the sum of P(0), P(1), P(2), P(3) for each of the "a" values): <table/><heading>According to the 3 sets of data calculated above, 3 OC curves for normal inspection, tightened inspection and reduced inspection are plotted on the same graph, as displayed below: </heading><figure/><heading>Q(c) Common upon: </heading><heading>The shapes of the OC curves (e.g., how far from ideal are they)</heading>As seen from the graph of OC-curves above, the OC-curve of tightened inspection is the steepest among the three, while the steepness of the reduced inspection OC-curve is the least among the three, (i.e., the most stretched). Additionally, the OC-curve of normal inspection is neither too stretched nor too steep, lying in the middle range between the tightened and reduced inspections. By comparing the three OC curves with the ideal curve on the graph, which is a straight vertical line, the tightened OC-curve is found to be the closest to the ideal OC-curve among the three, as it is the steepest out of the 3 curves. Consequently, the probability of acceptance during sampling is the lowest among the three inspections. In the same way, the OC-curve of normal inspection is the second closest to the ideal one, and the probability of acceptance during sampling is a little bit higher than that of tightened inspection. By contrast, the OC-curve of reduced inspection is the furthest from the ideal OC-curve, therefore, the probability of the acceptance during sampling is the highest among the three sampling inspections. <heading>The differences between them (e.g. this could be both qualitative and quantitative using measures linked to consumer and producer risks)</heading>As discussed in the previous question, the qualitative differences among the three OC-curves can be summarized as: the steepness of the curve and the degree of closeness of the curve shape to that of ideal curve. The steepness can be ordered as: Tightened inspection OC-curve>Normal inspection OC-curve>Reduced inspection OC-curve; the degree of closeness can be ordered as: Tightened inspection OC-curve>Normal inspection OC-curve>Reduced inspection OC-curve. The quantitative differences among the OC-curves can be explained by calculating the slopes of the 3 OC-curves respectively and comparing them. The slope of the curve joins the producer's risk point and the consumer's risk point and can be estimated using the equation: Slope (k)=(Producer's risk-Consumer's risk)/(Limiting quality level-Acceptance quality level), where the Producer's risk point corresponds to the probability level of 0.95 and the Consumer's risk point corresponds to the probability level of 0.10) <heading>For normal inspection: </heading>As shown from the OC-curve, the Acceptable quality level is found to be approximately 0.75 and the Limiting quality level is 3. So  FORMULA  <heading>For tightened inspection:</heading>As shown from the OC-curve, the Acceptable quality level is found to be approximately 0.35 and the Limiting quality level is 2.15. So  FORMULA  <heading>3: For reduced inspection:</heading>As shown from the OC-curve, the Acceptable quality level is found to be approximately 0.75 and the limiting quality level is approximately 4.875. So:  FORMULA  As referred to the calculated results above, it is clear that the slope of the tightened inspection OC-curve is the largest, and the one of normal inspection OC-curve is the middle, while the one of reduced inspection OC-curve is the smallest. Consequently, it is clear that the quantitative measurement of differences matches the qualitative measurement of differences. I.E., the tightened inspection OC-curve is the closest to the ideal curve, and the normal inspection OC-curve is the moderately closest to the ideal curve, while the reduced OC-curve is the furthest from the ideal curve. <heading>The food situations in which your sampling scheme might be used (e.g. what sort of food problems might be covered by the scheme you have been allocated)</heading>The sampling scheme I have been allocated includes combination of the three single sampling plans identified above with rules for changing from one plan to another. In order to locate my sampling scheme to particular food situation (s), certain aspects of the 3 single sampling plans within the scheme need to be considered in order to achieve an appropriate decision. As referred to the extract from Codex 'General Guidelines on Sampling' cited on page 39 of the handbook 'Statistical Aspects of Q.A', the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) for a given sampling plan is the rate of non-conforming items at which a lot will be rejected with a low probability, usually 5%. It is also referred to as particular producers' risk. Additionally, AQL can be used as an indexing criterion applied to a continuous series of lots which corresponds to a maximum rate of acceptable defective items in lots (or the maximum number of defective items per hundred items). The very important aspect of AQL is that it is a quality goal fixed by the profession. What that means is higher the rate of defective items exceeds the AQL, the greater is the probability of rejection of a lot. Therefore, for any given sample size, if the AQL is lowered, then the protection for the consumer against accepting lots with high defective rates becomes greater, and the requirement for the producer to conform with sufficiently high quality requirements becomes greater as well. However, any value for AQL should be realistic in practice and be economically viable. If necessary, the value of AQL should take into account safety aspects. Corresponding to the ISO standards cited on page 40 of the handbook of 'Statistical Aspects of Q.A', there are mainly two categories of product characteristics which are associated in matching the AQL levels. The first category is the characteristics which may be linked to critical defects (e.g., to sanitary risks), and this shall be associated with a low AQL (i.e. 0.1% to 0.65%); whereas the second category is the compositional characteristics such as fat or water content, etc, and this may be associated with a higher AQL (e.g. 2.5% or 6.5% are the values often used for milk products). As a result of those, for a given product, in order to monitor both of its safety and quality aspects, a single AQL should be allocated to each of the two classes of nonconformities. I.E., a low AQL (e.g. 0.65%) being allocated to class A nonconformities (e.g. pesticide content in follow-up milk), and a higher AQL (e.g. 6.5%) being allocated to class B nonconformities (e.g. protein content in follow-up milk). Consequently, there is a separate sampling plan for each of the two AQLs, and a lot is accepted only if it is accepted by each of the plans. Based on the principles discussed above, referring to my sampling scheme in this exercise, as estimated in Q(c) the corresponding AQLs of the producers' risk for the 3 single sampling plans of normal inspection, tightened inspection and reduced inspection are 0.75%, 0.35% and 0.75% respectively. As all the AQLs are close enough to 0.65%, which are considered to be low AQL values, the sampling scheme here containing the three single sampling plans can be allocated to the particular food situations (problems), which are class A nonconformities that are characteristics of food linking to critical defects, (e.g. sanitary risks like pesticide content in follow-up milk and other safety respects of the products).
