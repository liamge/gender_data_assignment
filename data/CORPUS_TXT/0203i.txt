's symptoms are normally well controlled by her medication, however, over the past 12 months her symptoms have been getting progressively worse and she has been having an increase in flare ups of her Crohns disease, her last admission was in  2005 when she was placed on steroids. Over the past 2 weeks,  has experienced: Abdominal pain -  described the pain as being sharp and localised to the LIF and RUQ. The pain was rated at 6/10 for intensity. The pain was not constant lasting for only a few seconds and  did not take anything to relieve the pain. Diarrhoea - Increased frequency (5-6 times day), no malaena or rectal bleeding. Stools are loose, contain mucous and are of normal colour, they do not float and are not foul smelling. Lethargy -  felt she has had approx 60% of her normal energy levels over the past 2 weeks. Loss of appetite and weight loss -  has lost one stone in weight over the past 2-3 months There has been occasional vomiting of bile and food mainly in the evening. There is no dysphagia. There is no arthralgia, no skin or eye symptoms and no mouth ulcers. There has been no recent foreign travel no identifiable dietary triggers and no exposure to anyone with similar symptoms. <heading>Past Medical History</heading><list><heading>Medical</heading>No AsthmaNo Diabetes MellitusNo anginaNo hypertensionNo epilepsyNo DVT/PE</list>Surgical Mole removed from neck <heading>Social History</heading> is a 23 year old lady who works as a project administrator.  has never smoked and drinks alcohol occasionally.  has 1 sister who is 18 months younger, they both live with their parents. <heading>Allergies</heading>NKA <heading>Medication</heading>Azathioprine 50 mg OD Immunosuppressant, modifies lymphocyte and plasma cell function Mesalazine 400 mg PO BD Aminosalicylate - stimulates prostaglandins and inhibits leukotrienes, scavenges free radicals and inhibits Interleukin 1 release Infliximab every 2 months Chimeric Antibody, has anti TNF alpha action Metronidazole 400 mg PO BD Antibiotic used in the treatment of inflammation in active Crohns (also used for treatment of perianal involvement at lower dose 0.6-1.5g) Side Effect = peripheral neuropathy Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BD Antibiotic used in the treatment of inflammation in active Crohns <heading>Family History</heading>No significant family history <heading>Systems Review</heading>Cardiovascular system No chest pain, orthopnoea or PND.

The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>Impression -  is a 23 year old lady who was diagnosed with Crohns Disease at the age of 7. Her symptoms have been well controlled by the medication. However over the past 12 months,  has noticed that her symptoms have become progressively worse with a marked increase in severity over the past 2 weeks.  presented with classic signs of exacerbation of her Crohns; 2 week history of diarrhoea, abdominal pain in the RIF and LUQ and weight loss. The abdominal pain may be caused by inflammation and spasm of the small/large intestine during an acute exacerbation of Crohns. It may also be due to stricture formation as seen in chronic disease. The diarrhoea  is experiencing may be due to a number of factors linked with her Crohns: <list>Bacterial overgrowth (due to obstructive stricture/fistula)Proctitis - impaired sphincter function and frequent passage of watery stools with mucousDecreased water absorption due to colonic involvementDecreased bile acid absorption in the terminal ileumStenosis e.g. rectal - causing constipation with overflow diarrhoea</list>Drug induced and infective causes of diarrhoea must also be excluded in patients with Crohns Disease. Infective - There are many infective causes for diarrhoea e.g. S. Aureus, E Coli and Salmonella, Rotavirus and Norwalk virus. Most infective causes of diarrhoea are acute and symptoms tend to resolve within 72 hours. Signs to look for on examination include: <list>signs of dehydration - dry mucosa, decreased skin turgortachycardiafever</list>Drug Induced (pseudomembranous colitis) - antibiotics e.g. Penicillins, Clindomycin and aminoglycosides can reduce the normal flora of the gut. This enables normal gut organisms such as Clostridium Difficile to grow. C Difficile produces a toxin which causes inflammation and necrosis of colonic mucosa resulting in diarrhoea.  had no evidence of such drug use in the past month from her history. Signs to look for on examination include distended abdomen with generalised tenderness. There are three main subgroups of Crohns Disease: <list>Fistula patternStricture patternDiarrhoea pattern</list>The fistula pattern of presentation leads to formation of penetrating sinuses with fistula or abscess formation. The types of fistula that can form are: entero-enteric (between adjacent lops of bowel), enterogastric (between bowel and stomach), enterovesical (between bowel and bladder), enterocutaneous (between bowel and skin). The stricture pattern produces postprandial abdominal pain with constipation. The locations of the abdominal pain point to pathology in the colon,  may have developed strictures in these regions. Stricture formation may also explain the occasional vomiting that  has experienced and the colicky abdominal pain. However one of the main symptoms  experiences is diarrhoea. <heading>Differential Diagnoses for presenting symptoms:</heading>Inflammatory Bowel Disease - There are 2 main types of Inflammatory Bowel Disease - Crohns and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Signs to look for on examination include markers of chronic disease e.g. clubbing, koilonychia, leukonychia, mouth ulcers, weight loss etc. Inflammatory bowel disease is also associated with systemic manifestations e.g. rashes, arthralgia, conjunctivitis etc and so these should also be looked for on examination.  did not report any blood in her stools which is more indicative of Crohns rather than Ulcerative Colitis which is associated with bloody diarrhoea. Infective - There are many infective causes for diarrhoea e.g. S. Aureus, E Coli and Salmonella, Rotavirus and Norwalk virus. Most infective causes of diarrhoea are acute and symptoms tend to resolve within 72 hours. Signs to look for on examination include: <list>signs of dehydration - dry mucosa, decreased skin turgortachycardiafever</list>Drug Induced (pseudomembranous colitis) - antibiotics e.g. Penicillins, Clindomycin and aminoglycosides can reduce the normal flora of the gut. This enables normal gut organisms such as Clostridium Difficile to grow. C. Difficile produces a toxin which causes inflammation and necrosis of colonic mucosa resulting in diarrhoea.  had no evidence of such drug use in the past month from her history. Signs to look for on examination include distended abdomen with generalised tenderness. Malabsorption - Coeliac Disease - inflammation of the mucosa of the small bowel due to gluten intolerance abdo pain, nausea and vomiting, steatorrhoea, Endocrine - Diarrhoea can be a symptom of some endocrine disorders e.g. hyperthryoidism, Diabetes. It is therefore important to look further symptoms associated with these disorders in order to exclude them as a differential e.g. Hyperthyroidism - sweaty palm, exopthalmus, fine tremor, goitre Irritable Bowel Syndrome This is the most common functional bowel disorder. Criteria for diagnosis state that ' in the past 12 months there should be at least 12 weeks of abdominal discomfort/pain with 2 out of 3 of the following - relieved with defaecation, onset associated with change in stool freq, onset associated with change in stool form'. If no other explanation can be found for this patients symptoms, patient follow up will determine whether they suffer from this condition. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading><heading>Examination on admission:</heading><list><heading>General Observations</heading>Pulse - 100 bpmBlood Pressure - 85/55Respiratory Rate - 20 pmTemperature 35.0 C</list>Weight - 40Kg Height - 162.56cm BMI - 15.27 (underweight) General Examination  appeared pale and underweight GI: The abdomen was soft and non-tender.

Given the history, the most likely diagnosis is a flare up of 's Crohns. The presence of inflammation, obstruction, abscess, and fistula should be investigated to determine the type of Crohns that  has i.e. is there any stricture formation as a cause of 's nausea and colicky abdominal pain, as this will help to tailor her management. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading><heading>Physically - </heading>Short Term: Over the past 2 weeks  has experienced a loss of appetite and consequent weight loss and lethargy.  will benefit from nutritional supplements to improve her energy levels and may require intravenous fluids if she is dehydrated due to the diarrhoea. Pain relief is difficult in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, NSAIDS can themselves cause gastric irritation and colitis, opioid analgesics can cause constipation with a risk of obstruction. If pain cannot be managed with paracetamol, Tramadol displays fewer opioid side effects and is less likely to cause constipation. Patients who are placed on such medication should be closely monitored for signs of constipation. Long Term: It appears that medical therapy is no longer controlling 's symptoms and so there may be an indication for surgery, this could be in the form of a stricturoplasty to widen any strictures, closure of any fistula's or resection of the affected part of the bowel. Also the continual use of steroids to control 's flare ups increases her risk of oseteoporosis and proximal myopathy, she is also at risk of Cushings syndrome (moon face, striae, acne, thin skin, bruising, buffalo hump, poor wound healing). <heading>Psychologically </heading>Psychologically  appeared to be in good spirits. Crohns Disease is a chronic condition with a relapsing/remitting nature. Such illnesses pose a threat to an individual's quality of life, their physical and emotional well being, social functioning and self-esteem. It is important that doctors listen to their patients concerns so that their condition can be managed appropriately. The option of surgery was mentioned approximately 6 months prior to admission, however,  opted to try and control her symptoms with medication to avoid the need for surgery.  is now keen to discuss surgery as she feels the medication is no longer controlling her symptoms. <heading>Socially </heading>If surgery is discussed it is important that  understands the implications of the proposed procedure.  may require a stoma post surgery and she will require time off work for recovery. Referral to a stoma nurse and inflammatory bowel nurse specialist should also be made. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management.

Colonoscopy is more invasive than flexible sigmoidoscopy and so is only used in patients where the extent of the disease is unknown or in patients who are at increased risk of carcinoma. <heading>Results</heading>Barium Follow Through : Normal small intestine Colonoscopy Report : Crohns disease affecting large intestine from caecum to the rectum. Colonic strictures identified and dilated at colonoscopy. <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading> as you aware your Crohns disease is becoming difficult to manage with medication. The frequency of your flare-ups has increased indicating that your current treatment regime is not controlling your Crohns. Colonoscopy also showed that some strictures have formed in your colon as a result of your Crohns Disease and these are the most likely cause of the recent pain you have been experiencing. We were able to dilate the strictures during the procedure so that your bowel contents were able to pass through more easily. However, given your current symptoms, it is likely that these strictures have reformed. We have discussed the option of surgery previously and you were keen to try and control you symptoms with medication. It appears that you are no longer responding to the treatment that we can offer to you and the current level of activity of your Crohns is resulting in you being malnourished. We therefore feel that it is appropriate to offer you the option of surgery. Surgery would involve removing the affected part of your colon, one end of your bowel would be brought out onto the skin of the abdominal wall. This is called a colostomy and the opening of the bowel is known as a stoma. Your bowel motions would pass through the stoma into a colostomy bag which is worn over the stoma. If we need to remove a large amount of your bowel the colostomy may be permanent. We can ask the stoma nurses to come and see you before the operation to talk through this with you in more detail. Are there any questions? <heading>Prescription/medical intervention </heading>Anaemia -  had 3 units of blood transfused to correct her low Hb Nutrition -  had been maintaining a low fibre diet, she was referred to a dietician who prescribed Fortijuice 200ml TDS to help with her malnourishment and to correct her low albumin and protein levels Commenced on Oral Prednisolone 30 mg OD Listed for surgery <heading>Observation</heading> was eating and drinking well during admission.

The main role of all treatment is to minimise symptoms and delay or prevent relapse. Due to the relapsing nature of the disease, the effect of treatment on the patients quality of life is an important factor in deciding on acute alterations to medical treatment or surgical intervention. Current medical therapy involves the use of steroids which still provide the quickest and most reliable response to active Crohns. However, due to the relapsing nature of the disease many patients can become steroid dependent leading to an increased risk of the adverse side effects of steroids e.g. Cushings syndrome. Recent studies have shown that TNF alpha blocking agents are effective in inducing remission in Crohns Disease [1]. This may in turn decrease the dependency for steroids. NICE guidelines 2002, recommended the use of Infliximab for the treatment of severe active Crohns when treatment with immunomodulating drugs and corticosteroids has failed or is no tolerated and when surgery is inappropriate [2]. The approved dose is 5mg/Kg given as IV infusion preferably at 0, 2 and 6 weeks [3]. Research has now moved past the benefits of Infliximab and onto agents that inhibit leukocyte recruitment and block molecules such as IL-2 in the inflammatory pathway [3]. In contrast with ulcerative colitis approximately 50% of patients with moderately active Crohn's colitis were shown to respond to oral metronidazole for up to 3 months [4]. The average age of onset for patients with Crohns Disease is in the early decades of life, but the average life expectancy is the same as the general population [5]. Unfortunately the cost of treatment forms a major part of discussion in all aspects of health care delivery and Crohns Disease is no exception. Hospitalisation for surgery consumes a large portion of the total cost of treatment for Crohns [5}. Indeed one paper commented that therapy, which decreases the number of surgical hospitalisations for Crohns, would reduce the overall costs of caring for patients with the disease [5].  appears to be having no significant response to medical therapy and the option of surgery was discussed. Research has shown that quality of life improved 30 days post surgery in patients with Crohns Disease and that this improvement was unrelated to patient characteristics, nature of disease or intervention performed [6]. Indeed many patients who underwent surgery for Crohns Disease in the study felt that surgery had helped them and felt they would undergo surgery again [6]. Surgery is usually indicated for patients whose disease fails to respond to drug or dietary therapy. Resection is not curative and there is a 50% chance of recurrence that will require further surgery at 10 years [7]. Some patients prefer to opt for surgery at presentation rather than pharmacological or nutritional treatment of unknown duration. Unfortunately, there is no controlled data to confirm the best approach for patients [7]. There is a well-known association between ulcerative colitis and an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and patients with Crohns disease are believed to be at increased risk of cancer of the small intestine. Studies have shown that the relative risk of colorectal cancer in patients with Crohn's colitis is approximately 5.6 and should raise the same concerns as in patients with ulcerative colitis [8]. Surveillance should begin 8 - 10 years after disease onset for pancolitis and 15 - 20 years after onset for disease affecting the left side of the colon [8]. At the time of admission, 's colon only was affected by Crohns, she was diagnosed at the age of 7 and so regular surveillance to identify any dysplasia within the colon would have been indicated according to this paper. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>Crohns disease affects between 30,000 and 60,000 people in the UK, (approximately 1 in 1200) with between 3,000 and 6,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Research shows that the number of people with Crohn's Disease has been rising steadily, particularly among young people [9]. The most effective prophylactic measure in patients with Crohns Disease is to refrain from smoking, the risk of relapse in non smokers at 3 years is approximately 30% lower than in smokers [1]. It is vital that the care of patients with Crohns disease includes advice on such lifestyle habits to prevent future exacerbations of the disease. With the advances in research and the variety of treatment options available it is essential that the patient remains at the focus of the decision making process so that they are fully informed on all available treatment therapies. This will ensure that the most appropriate management plan is developed for the patient. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading><list>Presenting symptoms associated with CrohnsDifferential diagnoses for patients presenting with acute diarrhoea and appropriate investigationsManagement of patients with Crohns DiseaseDifferences between Crohns and Ulcerative Colitis</list>
