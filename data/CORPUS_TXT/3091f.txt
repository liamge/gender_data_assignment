Numerical and experimental methods for determining the dynamic behaviour will be investigated and conclusions drawn from the results obtained. The application of modal analysis techniques in an automotive environment will be considered and implications of structural design on vehicle structures discussed. <heading>Objectives</heading>The main objectives of the investigation are: Perform practical experimental investigation of a freely supported steel plate using modal analysis software. Perform a full modal analysis of the steel plate under varying support schemes using Finite Element (FE) package. Investigate the effects of varying geometry of the steel plate using FE package. Predict the steel plates dynamic characteristics through the use of ESDU charts <heading>Theory</heading>This report investigates three methods for performing a modal analysis of a flat plate: <list>Practical TestingFE Analysis ESDU charts</list><heading>Practical Testing</heading>Modal Analysis is the process of data acquisition through means of practical testing of a structure, data analysis using various curve fitting techniques is then carried out on the results. The aim of the analysis is to develop a mathematical model of a structures frequency response. This model is often used to compare against theoretical results obtained through FE Analysis to prove the theoretical model. Data is obtained by applying a know excitation force to the structure and measuring the structures response (acceleration). This is known as "inertance", and is determined using Equation 3.1. Often this "time history" data is converted from the time domain to the frequency domain through a Fast Fourier Transform analyser to enable the use of curve-fitting methods. By using curve fitting methods such as "Circle Fit" and "Least squares" it is possible to define a "set of modal properties which best match the response characteristics of the tested structure" . <enote>EWINS, D.J "Modal Testing - theory, practice and application" 2nd Edition, Research Studies Press Ltd, 2000, p18 </enote> FORMULA  Equation 3.1 - Inertance <heading>FE Analysis</heading>Finite Element Analysis is an analytical process, which utilises modern computational systems to solve complex simultaneous, algebraic equations. These algebraic equations are the result of subdividing a complex shape into many discrete, interconnected, simple shapes. FE Analysis builds a theoretical model of the dynamic characteristics of a structure. Once a FE model has been proven by comparison with other results, such as those gained from practical testing, the FE model can be used to simulate many varying operating conditions to fully investigate a structures response. <heading>ESDU Charts</heading>ESDU provides engineering data and design tools over a wide range of engineering disciplines, such as Aerospace, Mechanical, Structural engineering. <enote>Engineering Science Data Unit Website  URL  </enote>The ESDU document used to evaluate the modal response of flat plates is document number 75030 "Natural Frequencies of Rectangular Flat Plates with Various Edge Conditions". This document provides formulae to calculate the natural frequencies of flat rectangular plates, base on the plates physical and material properties. The document covers a variety of edge conditions and provides the frequency coefficients for each edge condition, displayed in a graphical representation. <heading>Procedure</heading><heading>Experimental Modal Analysis</heading>This section contains a brief overview of the procedure used for the experimental modal analysis carried out on the flat rectangular steel plate. For a detailed description of the experimental testing procedure see Appendix 1. <list><heading>The equipment used in the laboratory testing was:</heading>Steel Plate, as shown in Figure 4.1, suspended via elastic supports to mimic a free-free support scheme. Electro-magnetic vibratorForce transducerAccelerometerCharge amplifiersSpectrum analyserComputer with analytical software</list>The material properties for the steel plate used in the experiment can be seen in Table 4.1. The plate was divided into a grid, with each line intersection termed a 'node'. The force transducer was attached to each node in turn. An exciting force of 0-100Hz was applied to the plate near node 24 shown in Figure 4.1, this input force was recorded through one channel on the spectrum analyser. For each node position the accelerometer, connected to the second channel on the spectrum analyser measured the varying accelerations at that particular node on the plate over the applied force frequency range (0-100Hz). The readings of applied force and accelerometer where then passed through an amplifier stage to increase the magnitude of the measured signals and fed into the spectrum analyser. <table/>Each input cycle of 0-100Hz is repeated 16 times in order to get an average response of the plate at that specific node. This time history is stored in the spectrum analyser, then converted from the time domain in to the frequency domain using the Laplace Transform. The transfer function is the found using Equation 4.1.  FORMULA  Equation 4.1 - Transfer Function The transfer function describes the modal response at that particular node as a real number (magnitude) with imaginary part (phase angle). These results are then downloaded in to the PC for further analysis. <figure/><heading>FE Analysis</heading>The FE package used to perform modal analysis for models of the steel plate was COSMOS M2.5. This is a design analysis software package that models, meshes, and analyses a component or system of components (assembly). The analysis results are displayed graphically on the computer screen and allow a detail visualisation of the component or assemblies characteristics. <enote>COSMOS Design Analysis Software  URL  </enote>This section outlines the basic steps required to perform a modal analysis of a flat plate. A detailed description of the procedure to construct and configure the software for a swage plate discussed later in this report with Free-Free boundary conditions can be seen in Appendix 2. For the analysis of the flat plates plain 2D Shell elements were used, since its span to thickness ratio is 1.03/300=0.00343. As a general rule of thumb shell elements are used for span to thickness ratio of 0.05 or less. Using shell elements reduces the computational time and system requirements required to do an FE analysis on a component, since only a 2D analysis is required. The components thickness is specified as a constant value used during the analysis of the structure. <heading>Create Geometry</heading>The model geometry is created so that a mesh can be created. The working plane is defined, on to which a gird is created. The grid serves as a drawing aid when positioning the various parts of the components geometry. In the case of constructing a 2D model of the flat plate the size and density of the grid is set so that the outer limits of the grid define the overall dimensions of the flat plate. Points are then positioned on the grid to define the outer boundary of the plate. These points are then joined using lines (in COSMOS lines are defines as curves of infinite radius). <figure/>Figure 4.2 shows the geometry of the flat plate. Once the outline of the flat plate is defined a surface can be created. A mesh can then be applied to a face, specifying the number of elements required along the X and Y directions (if the grid is assigned to the X & Y co-ordinates). Figure 4.3 shows the meshed flat plate geometry. <figure/>The physical properties of the model are defined, such as the element group (shell, solid etc), material properties. <heading>Checking for Convergence</heading>Tests were made to determine the smallest mesh density that yielded accurate results. These tests were carried out on the flat plate model, with free-free boundary conditions. The mesh density was increased and the natural frequencies measured. An arbitrary frequency value of 150Hz was chosen to compare the results from the different mesh densities. This correlated to the 17 th natural frequency in the list generated COSMOS. Convergence is assumed to occur when the actual value was within 5% of the desired value. Graph 4.1 shows a plot of the calculated natural frequency for a given mesh density. The mesh density on the X-Axis refers to the mesh elements on the X-Axis, the number of elements on the Y-Axis being a ratio of the length different between the two sides (300/500 = 0.6). This is an important point when performing FE Analysis, in order to achieve the desired accuracy of the results the mesh element aspect ratio (length/width) should be kept as close to 1 as possible. As a general rule of thumb the higher the mesh density, the more distortion in element shape can be accommodated. <enote>GERGURI. S Lecture notes on U04527 "Design & Computer Aided Engineering" School of Engineering, Oxford Brookes University, 2004/2005 </enote>For example:  FORMULA  The mesh densities tested were: <table/>From the results in Table 4.1 it can be seen that a mesh density of 20x12 is adequate to ensure that the results accurate within 1.3% of those found with much greater mesh densities. The mesh density ideally should be kept as large as possible ensuring computational time and system requirements are kept to a minimum. This is more important when analysing large models. Therefore the mesh density for the flat plate models should exceed 20x12 to ensure accurate results. <figure/><heading>Boundary Conditions</heading>The flat plate model was investigated using different types of edge conditions, these can be seen in Figure 4.4. Each type of boundary condition was modelled the results of the analysis can be seen in section 0. <figure/>Boundary or Edge conditions were applied to the flat plate FE model, to mimic the different configurations of the plate as shown in Figure 4.4. The FE package allows each node, curve or surface to be fixed in any of the 6 axis. That is transition in the X,Y,Z plane and rotation about the X,Y,Z axis. The boundary conditions applied to the model can be seen in Figure 4.7, where the red line or dot denoted the addition of one or more boundary conditions. For the fully clamped and pinned flat plates the edges were constrained along their entire length. For the spot welded plate the model was broken down into 12 surfaces, and at each intersection the node was constrained as shown. Note that the mesh on the spot welded model had a high mesh density, this was the lowest density possible that ensure all elements remained the same size and with and aspect ratio of 1. <figure/><heading>Curved Plate</heading>A curve plate was modelled in the FE package, and an analysis run to investigate the effects on the natural frequency and mode shapes that the addition of a curve has on the flat plate design. The curved plate model can be seen in Figure 4.6 the plate was the same dimensions as the flat plate. Dimensions in mm <figure/>Modelling of the curved plate in the FE package was relatively straight forward. A curve can be produced by entering its centre point, and the start and end point for the arc. The arc can them be extruded to create a surface, which can then be meshed. Applying element groups and material properties is the same as the flat plate model. <heading>Swage Feature on Flat Plate</heading>The FE Analysis allows different plate configurations to be analysed by modelling geometrically similar models of the actual component. Two different types of stiffening were added to the flat plate to investigate the effects they had on the natural frequency of the plate, they were: <heading>Swage Stiffener (Model 1)</heading>This was simply a raised "fold" a long the centre line of the flat plate, shown in Figure 4.7. <figure/>The overall dimension for the plate remained 300mm x 500mm. A detailed description of a swage plate FE model can be seen in Appendix 2. The features dimensions were varied to investigate how the shape effected the modal response of the plate, these configurations can be seen in Table 4.3. <table/><heading>Swage Stiffener (Model 2)</heading>A swage model was created as shown in the second diagram in Figure 4.8. Two configurations were investigated, the dimensions of which can be seen in Table 4.4. As far as the software is concerned the geometry is the centre of the component, so the thickness and therefore mass are equally distributed about the centre of the geometry. The physical model would look like diagram B in Figure 4.8, but when modelled using the FE package it would be resemble diagram A, with the extra thickness being equally distributed about its central axis. This means that the FE results are not a direct representation but rather an approximation of the components characteristics. <table/>Length = 500mm <figure/><heading>ESDU Analysis</heading>The ESDU paper relating to the frequency response of flat rectangular plates is number 75030, titled "Natural Frequencies of Rectangular Flat Plates with Various Edge Conditions". The plate geometry and edge conditions are depicted in Figure 4.9. The naming notations for the various edge conditions can be seen in Table 4.5. Using these naming conventions, the boundary conditions shown in Figure 4.9 would be SF-SC, listing the upper then lower edge along edge 'a' followed by left then right edges along length 'b'. <table/><figure/>The natural frequencies of an unloaded plate are obtained from one of the expressions in Equation 4.2. <enote>ESDU Data Item 75030 "Natural Frequencies of Rectangular Flat Plates with Various Edge Conditions" </enote> FORMULA  Equation 4.2 - ESDU Natural Frequencies Where C is calculated using the following formula  FORMULA  Equation 4.3 - Calculating the value of C "Frequency coefficient F a is used for modes where bending occurs only about axes parallel to the y-axis. This condition arises in the cases of plates with both long sides free when n = 1. Frequency coefficient F ab is used for pure torsion modes which occur for plates with both long sides free when n = 2, and for plates with one long side free and the other simply-supported when n = 1. Frequency coefficient F b is used in all other cases"5. <heading>Mode Shapes</heading>"For any mode of vibration, mode numbers m and n may be related to the nodal lines provided that these lines are parallel, or approximately parallel, to the plate sides. For these cases, m and n are one plus the number of nodal lines crossing any line parallel to the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. In this definition plate edges, supported or free, are not counted as nodal lines"5. The mode starts off at m=1, n=1 (1,1) indicating there is no displacement in the plate, this is called rigid body motion. An example of a mode can be seen in Figure 4.10. Where m is along the X-Axis and has 2 node lines crossing it +1 = 3, and n is along the Y-Axis and has no node lines crossing it, hence only has the value +1. Therefore the mode is said to be m=3, n=1, (3,1). <figure/>The frequency coefficients F a, F b and F ab, are plotted in ESDU 75030 against b/a. To find the value of these coefficients, the value of c and b/a need to be determined.  FORMULA  Also  FORMULA  <heading>Example ESDU Calculation</heading>For this example it is required to find the 3 lowest natural frequencies of a flat plate with long and short edges fully clamped (CC-CC). From the ESDU 75030 the frequency coefficient for these edge conditions are shown in ESDU figure 43 in Appendix 5. In this figure the frequency coefficient is F b, and the formula for calculating the natural frequencies is given as:  FORMULA  Equation 4.4 - Flat Plate CC-CC Edge Conditions Where:  FORMULA  The required natural frequencies are therefore  FORMULA  <heading>Results</heading>The modes and natural frequencies of the plate with various edge conditions and additional features can be seen in this section. Appendix 3 contains all the tabulated data displayed graphically, comparing the correlation between the three methods. Appendix 4 contains images of the modal response along with natural frequencies of all the plates tested from the FE Analysis. Appendix 5 contains the relevant ESDU charts used to determine the natural frequencies for the ESDU calculations. The results tables reference the necessary EDSU chart figures. <heading>Mode Shape Identification</heading>For the practical results, the mode shapes generated by the practical experimental analytical software produces the deformed plate image, with black lines running across the plate. These black lines are assumed to be the nodal lines, and are used to determine the mode shape. For the FE Analysis results, the deformed plots are shown coloured according to the displacement. The modal lines for these images are assumed to occur at the areas of zero displacement, depicted by the green areas. Therefore the examples in Figure 5.1 both have a mode shape of 3,1, bending. <figure/><heading>Flat Plate, Free-Free (FF-FF) Edge Conditions</heading>The results for the flat plate with free-free edge conditions can be seen in Table 5.1. It shows the results of the lab testing, FE Analysis and ESDU calculation results. The first 6 modes from the FE Analysis were rigid body modes. <table/><heading>Flat Plate, Simply Supported (SS-FF) Edge Conditions</heading>The results for the flat plate with simply supported edge conditions can be seen in Table 5.2. It shows the results of the FE Analysis and ESDU calculation results. <table/><heading>Flat Plate, Fully Clamped (CC-CC) Edge Conditions</heading>The results for the flat plate with fully clamped edge conditions can be seen in Table 5.3. It shows the results of the FE Analysis and ESDU calculation results. <table/><heading>Flat Plate, Spot Welded </heading>The ESDU data did not contain a suitable edge condition configuration to effectively predict the effects of constraining the flat plate with spot welds. Therefore the results shown in Table 5.4 only contain frequency values calculated using the FE Analysis software. <table/><heading>Curved Plate, Free-Free (FF-FF) Edge Conditions</heading>Table 5.5 shows the results of the curved plate mode shapes and corresponding natural frequencies, also included are the results from the flat plate. The edge conditions for both models were free-free. <table/><heading>Swage Plate, Free-Free (FF-FF) Edge Conditions</heading>The first 6 mode shapes from the FE results were rigid body motion due to the free-free edge conditions. Table 5.6 shows the results of the four FE models tested, showing their first 6 mode shapes and corresponding natural frequency. Note that the mode shapes don't appear in the same sequence for each model. <table/><heading>Discussion</heading>As shown in the results section, the flat plate model with differing edge conditions was investigated. Practical results were obtained for the FF-FF edge conditions, and FE & ESDU results were obtained for SS-FF & CC-CC edge conditions also. The FE Analysis was also able to investigate the effects of spot weld edge conditions. FE Analysis was carried out on a swage plate, with varying feature dimensions. A curved plate was also modelled and the results compared to the flat plate model. <heading>Results Correlation</heading>FE Analysis is an analytical method for determining the modal properties of a structure, ESDU data is based on the results of many practical tests. It is often necessary to validate results in order to effectively evaluate the accuracy of test results or analytical predictions. The correlation process consists of two main steps. The first step is to compare the modal parameter results, this is the natural frequencies and mode shapes. Secondly adjustments are made to the test setup or FE model in order achieve more comparable results. Typically FE Analysis is compared to practical testing to check the validity of the FE results. If the results are seen to agree, or after modifications to the FE model the results are in agreement with the practical testing the FE model can be used to simulate response to actual operating environments. Correlation of results usually consists of comparing measured and predicted results in the form of a table or graphically. Comparing predicted with test results, is done graphically by plotting one verses the other, this highlights relative differences as well as identifying global trends in results. If direct correlation of results is obtained, the points will lie on a straight line, with a slope of 1.0, as shown in Graph 6.1. <figure/>If a random scatter arises then the FE model may not be a direct representation of the actual structure. If the points are arranged in a straight line, but have a different slope other than 1.0 then the problem may be due to incorrect material properties, such as mass density or elastic modulus. As a general rule a slope of between 0.9 and 1 is acceptable. <heading>FF-FF Edge Conditions</heading>The natural frequencies of the flat plate for each of the three methods tested can be seen in Table 5.1. Graphs 1-4 in Appendix 3 show the correlation of the method results. Section 1 of Appendix 4 shows the mode shapes using FE Analysis with the equivalent mode shape found by practical testing. Graph 1 of Appendix 3 shows that the FEA and ESDU results have very good correlation, the results indicate that there is a slight discrepancy, Ewins suggests that discrepancies such as these are usually attributed to erroneous material properties. In graph 2, FE vs. Test results, the correlation appears to be a random scatter but follows a reasonable correlation line suggesting that the FE model produces the correct response over the tested frequency range, albeit at low accuracy. The same can be said for graph 3, where the gradient appears to be close to 1, but seems to be offset from the ideal correlation over the entire frequency range tested. Table 5.1 shows that there is some disagreement with the FE and ESDU results, the practical results being consistently lower than the other methods. This may be due to some inherent damping in the practical results from the physical properties of the plate or by the support system. <enote>EWINS, D.J "Modal Testing - theory, practice and application" 2nd Edition, Research Studies Press Ltd, 2000, p420 </enote>It can also be seen that the mode shape 2,2 didn't appear in the practical test results where as the FE and ESDU suggest it exists in this configuration. The ESDU natural frequency values are very close to these given by the FEA. <heading>Curve Plate</heading>A curved version of the flat plate was modelled using the FE package to investigate the effect of adding a curve to the flat plate of 1500mm radius. Section 5 of Appendix 4 shows the mode shapes for the curved plate and compares them to those found on the flat plate, Table 5.5 shows the tabulated natural frequencies of the two plates. From the results it can be seen that the mode shapes appear in both models although some have very different natural frequencies. Essentially the addition of the curve ups the natural frequencies of mode shapes in most cases, but only by a small amount. <heading>SS-FF & CC-CC Edge Conditions</heading>Only FE and ESDU results were obtained for the pinned and fully clamped flat plates. The results of which can be seen in Table 5.2 and Table 5.3. These results show excellent correlation (graphs 6 & 5 in Appendix 3) between the FEA and ESDU, having minimal scatter with good linearity. Comparisons with the results obtained from the FF-FF edge conditions show that the additional boundary conditions have a pronounce effect on the natural frequency of the plate. The SS-FF plate has higher natural frequencies than the FF-FF plate, its mode shapes are mostly bending modes below 100Hz. Its lowest natural frequency occurring at 27.6Hz. For the CC-CC plate the natural frequencies are much higher as expected due to the more restrictive edge conditions. Its first three mode shapes are identical to the SS-FF plate, albeit at a higher frequency. The CC-CC plate is the stiffest of the structure, with its lowest natural frequency occurring at 73.5Hz. These results show that by altering the edge conditions on geometrically similar plates the natural frequencies can be increased. <heading>Swage Stiffener</heading>Table 5.6 shows the results of the swage plate models with mode shape and corresponding natural frequency. Its interesting to note that the mode shapes don't all appear in the same order, where the change in geometry shifts a mode shape to a different frequency. An example of this can be seen in the mode shapes of models 1A and 1B, where the mode shapes 2,3 and 3,2 occur opposite to one another. Appendix 4 section 6 through 9 shows the first 6 mode shapes and natural frequencies for each models configuration. The edge conditions were free-free and therefore it is possible to see the effects of adding a swage stiffener to the flat plate. A found with the FF-FF edge conditions the first 6 or 7 mode shapes are rigid body motion. When comparing models 1A and 1B it can be seen that the addition of the swage increases the lowest natural frequency by only a small margin. The mode shape 3,1 that occurs on the flat plate (21.89Hz FEA) is replaced with a torsional mode shape 2,2 for both models and occur at 23.58Hz 1A and 23.8Hz 1B. Another interesting characteristic of the swage was the gap between the natural frequencies, on the flat plate, the first two mode shapes occur at similar natural frequencies (19.93 & 22.9Hz FEA) where as on the swage models the natural frequencies are more than doubled. The biggest effect of adding the swage to the models is to reduce the tendency of bending mode shapes, 3,1 for example. Torsion or a ripple effect being the more common mode shape. Comparing model 1A to 1B shows that the larger swage (1B) offers a slightly stiffer structure and hence slightly higher natural frequencies, although this effect is minimal around the lower frequencies, especially for the first two mode shapes where the results can be seen to be almost the same. Models 2A and 2B offer additional stiffness with the extra material under the swage and the extra thickness either side. This effect is easily noticed by the raise in natural frequencies. Natural frequencies of 71Hz (2A) and 90Hz (2B) for the mode shape 2,2 (torsion) being identified as opposed to around 23Hz for 1A & 1B. Mode shapes remain similar to those found in models 1A & 1B, the larger swage (2B) again showing more resistance to bending mode shapes. These FE models indicate that the addition of the swage feature have the effect of raising the natural frequencies. Surprisingly though the simple swage feature (model 1A & 1B) has little effect on the lowest natural frequencies, although proceeding natural frequencies are considerably higher than those on the flat plate model. Convergence testing was carried out on model 2A to check that assumptions made using the flat plate mesh results were still valid. These results indicated that 50 mesh elements along side 'a' (500mm) was sufficient to yield accurate results. All models used between 50 and 100 elements along side 'a', actual mesh densities depended on geometry size where element aspect ratio was the dominating factor for final mesh densities. <heading>Practical Testing</heading>From Table 5.1 and correlation graphs shown in Appendix 3 it can be seen that of the three methods the practical test results varied more than the FEA and ESDU results when compared with one another. The results can be seen to be consistently lower that those found using either the FE Analysis or from the EDSU charts. These variations can be attributed to the small inconsistencies which inevitably occur with measured data. Possible causes of these inconsistencies can be attribute to: Mathematical errors introduced when moving from the time to frequency domain. These errors can be minimised by averaging out the sample data. Mass loading (Roving) effect due to the position of the accelerometer on the plate. Since each node required the repositioning of the transducer. This effect might be minimised be using a transducer at every node simultaneously, a costly option in terms of number of transducers and input channels required. Another option might the addition of dummy transducers on the node positions which are moved around to cater for the repositioning of the transducer. Both these options have the effect of increasing the mass of the plate, which is known to be a key parameter in determining the resonant frequency of a system,  FORMULA  Inherent damping in the material and elastic supports may be a source of error, since the FE Analysis assumes zero damping. Mathematical errors introduced when performing non-linear least squares method or curve fitting algorithms. A known problem with the modal testing technique used for the practical testing is the effect of "leakage" on the results. Leakage can be thought of as energy that has leaked across spectral lines. It is cause by sampling data over a certain periodic time, T, whereby if the frequency response does not fit into the sampling period exactly, implying discontinuity then the periodic assumption made when analysing the data is invalid. This effect is described in Figure 6.1 vii where the sinusoidal signal fits to the periodic time sample (a), and misses the periodic sample (b). The effect is extra spectral lines on (b) where some of the energy has leaked across to other frequencies. <figure/>It is interesting to note that with all three test results plotted for different mode shapes (graph 4 Appendix 3) of the three methods the practical results yielded the most linear response over the frequency range tested. Even taking into consideration the slight variation between actual frequency values, the mode shapes and modal response shown from the practical results are in close agreement with both the FE and ESDU results. Appendix 4 section 1 shows the comparison of the mode shapes generated by the FE Analysis against the mode shapes found by practical testing. <heading>ESDU data</heading>The EDSU document relating to modal response of rectangular plates was found to be straight forward in application, and covers a wider variety of edge conditions. Comparison with the FE results for flat plate with CC-CC, SS-FF showed excellent correlation, the model shapes and natural frequencies were in close agreement, as can be seen in Table 5.2 and Table 5.3 The application of the formulae is a straight forward process, although care must be taken when reading values for the frequency coefficients from the figures in the document. There is also a design tool designated ESDUpac A9016 which is a computer program that can be used to evaluate flat plate natural frequencies with or without in-plane loading. The FF-FF edge conditions were slightly more scattered, but still maintain good correlation to the FEA results. <heading>FE Analysis</heading>As shown in comparisons made between each of the three methods discussed in this report the FEA package is easily capable of producing predicted modal responses for the flat plate design to an accuracy attained by both the ESDU data and practical testing. The benefits of the FEA package lie in its ability to accurately model a systems response under specified conditions. One of the major advantages of FEA as a means of testing is its ability to investigate many different configurations in a short space of time. The results can be displayed in a variety of ways, numerical, graphical, or a combination of the two. Although initial outlay in the purchasing of the package may be significant, the cost savings systems like this bring is of much greater importance. The draw back of FEA is perhaps that it is too accurate, since the system by its nature assumes perfection, materials with no flaws in, constrains with zero movement etc. Also an incorrectly configured model will produce meaningless results, even correctly configured models may not produce results of adequate accuracy, as demonstrated by the convergence testing. This highlighted the need for correct mesh densities in order to attain the desired level of accuracy. There is a definite advantage in being able to confirm results obtained through the use of FEA with some other method. <heading>Vibrations in Design</heading>"The trend in modern design of structures for trains, ships, cars and aircraft has for a long time been towards making them even lighter. This trend is, among other things, driven by a combination of environmental and economic considerations. Lighter constructions imply lower fuel consumption and also reduced expenditure on materials. At the same time it is generally acknowledged that a good design should also be quiet and not exhibit any noticeable vibration levels. Unfortunately, these two objectives of light and quiet, non-vibrating constructions are conflicting. Reducing the material thickness of an element such as a plate will lower the values of its natural frequencies and increase the number of natural frequencies within a given frequency range, thereby increasing the risk of encountering noise and vibration problems. To reduce noise and vibration levels on existing constructions is often very difficult if not impossible and will often involve high expenditure. In the design process it is therefore desirable to be able to predict the dynamic response of a structure so that excessive vibration levels, resonance problems, failure due to acoustic fatigue and noise problems can be avoided". <enote>ESDU Data Item 97033 "METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF THE DYNAMIC RESPONSE OF STRUCTURES" </enote>A typical example of how modal analysis is used in determining the dynamic response of a design is shown in Figure 6.3 which shows the floor pan of a car boot. The aim of the car manufacture is to ensure the boot is strong enough to support luggage loads, whilst being light and not susceptible to excessive vibrations. This design incorporates a corrugation type layout in order to increase the stiffness of the shape. Other examples include the use of stringers to add stiffness to a structure, as shown in Figure 6.2. <figure/>The use of modal analysis techniques enables the designer to test various configurations for edge support, and different panel geometries. As the models tested in this report have shown the addition of stiffer geometry improves the dynamic response characteristics of a flat plate. By stiffening the structure, or changing edge conditions (pinned or fully clamped) the components mass can be reduced, whilst raising its natural frequency to acceptable limits. <picture/><heading>Conclusion</heading>With advancing technology companies are always pushing to be the market leader, product time to market, performance and value for money are all key to the success of a product. It is therefore vital that the company use the most appropriate tools to perform engineering tasks. This report has investigated 3 methods available to the engineer to investigate the modal response of flat plates. It has critically compared all there methods highlighting the pros and cons for each method. As desktop computers become ever more powerful advanced analytical tools offer the engineer greater freedom to design complex components and much shorter development cycles. However advanced tools require training, and proficiency comes with experience and regular use of the tools. ESDU design data and design tools is another valuable addition the engineers tool box, allowing quick and straight forward component or structural evaluation without the large outlay associated with advanced FEA software packages. Possibly the most realistic of all the methods discussed in this report is actual test of the real thing, which yields real life results as opposed to predicted results. Is it important to realise that results from any of the methods are only as accurate as the setup or configuration. Incorrect material properties, physical constraints may render the results meaningless. Being able to validate predicted or practical results is still an important part of the development process and should not be over looked. This report has shown how the design of flat steel plates such as those found in vehicle structures can be affected by geometrical layout and varying edge conditions. From the results gained through the testing of different plate geometries and edge conditions it has been shown that structures can be modified to obtain more desirable dynamic characteristics of the structure. The results showed that additional stiffness either by changing edge conditions or additional stiffer geometry causes the natural frequencies of a structure to be increased, and as a result the gap between natural frequencies is increased.
