Her mother is a full time mother whilst her father works outside the home.  does not attend any play groups. Neither of her parents smoke. <heading>Analysis of history</heading> has full thickness burns below her lip and covering her entire chin. She has she patches of partial thickness burns over her right arm. The depth of dermis lost is a function of the temperature and the duration of the exposure. It is crucial to the long term effects of the injury. <heading>Assessment</heading><heading>Extent of burn</heading>Assessing the extent of the burn gives important information regarding severity, likelihood of complications, and need for specialist care. This is usually expressed as a percentage of total body surface area (TBSA). The Lund and Browder chart, if available, is a reliable method of assessing the amount of skin burnt. It can be used in both adults and children. In adults, the 'Rule of Nines' is commonly used (areas of slight redness are ignored): 9% for the head, 9% for each arm, 18% for each leg, 18% for either the back or the front of the trunk, and 1% for the perineal area. In children, the head is relatively larger and the legs relatively smaller, so the 'Rule of Nines' does not apply. A simply way of assessing the area of skin burnt is to compare it with the surface area covered by the child's hand with the fingers closed, which is equal to 1.25% of TBSA. This method can also be used in adults for assessment of scattered burns, but the equivalent surface area is 1%.(1) <heading>Depth of burn</heading>Assessment of the depth of the burn can often be made clinically, although this may be difficult, especially for partial-thickness burns. Superficial (first-degree) burns (e.g. sunburn or minor scalds) involve the epidermis and are usually erythematous, slightly painful, and do not tend to blister. They peel and usually heal in a few days with no scarring. Partial-thickness (second-degree) burns involve some damage to the dermis. Superficial partial-thickness burns involve the epidermis and the superficial part of the dermis. They present as painful, red, blistered areas, which become moist as the blisters burst. They heal within 10-21 days. Deep partial-thickness burns involve deeper layers of the dermis. They present as pale or red areas, which may be painful or relatively anaesthetic. There is usually less blistering than with superficial partial-thickness burns. Healing occurs with variable degrees of scarring, depending on the depth of the burn. Full-thickness (third-degree) burns destroy the entire dermis. They result in a painless, dry, leathery, white or brown wound, which usually requires skin grafting.(2) Circumferential burns of the chest can cause difficulty in breathing by constricting chest wall movements. If a circumferential burn involves a limb or digit it can cause distal ischaemia by restricting blood flow. Surgical incision (escharotomy) may be needed.(3) Respiratory burns can cause severe respiratory distress, which may be delayed. The possibility of a respiratory burn should be suspected from the history, or from the presence of burns around the face and neck, burnt nasal hairs, soot particles in the nose and mouth, hoarseness, stridor, or wheezing. <heading>Epidemiology</heading>Burns are common; most are minor and will be treated at home, without need for medical intervention. It is estimated that around 112,000 people visit Accident and Emergency departments each year as a result of burns or scalds and that at least a further 250,000 people visit GP surgeries for burns and scald injuries. Children under 5 years old account for nearly 45% of all severe burns and scalds. About 50% of these accidents happen in the kitchen. Cups of hot drinks are involved in about 1265 severe burns a year (requiring admission to hospital), of which 1100 occur with children less than 5 years of age. Most involve the child reaching up and pulling a mug or cup of hot drink on to himself or herself. Baths are involved in over 570 severe burns a year. Most involve an unsupervised child falling or climbing into a bath of very hot water. Other common causes of severe burns include kettles, teapots and coffee-pots, jugs of hot water, saucepans, irons, cookers, fires and heaters, and chip pans and deep fat fryers.(4) Burns involving the face, scalp, hands, feet, joints, and the perineum require special care, and should generally be referred unless obviously minor.(5) <heading>Differential diagnosis</heading><heading>Non-accidental injury</heading>Suspected non-accidental injury always requires urgent referral or admission.

Minor burns are comparable to abrasions, and there is no need for complicated treatments. 2. Keeping the burn clean is probably the most important aspect of care and can be done simply by washing with tap water and patting dry. 3. There is controversy over whether to leave blisters intact or not.(6) There is some evidence that burn blister fluid may impair wound healing. However, there is also some evidence that draining or de-roofing blisters may increase the likelihood of the burn becoming infected. In practice, small or thick-walled blisters are often left intact, whereas large confluent or thin-walled blisters are usually drained. 4. Prophylactic systemic or topical antibacterials (e.g. Flamazine) are not indicated for minor burns. Antibiotics should only be used if infection is clinically present. 5. Exposing the burn to air or covering it with a dressing (non-adherent dressing or vapour-permeable film) are both reasonable options and depend on individual circumstances (e.g. the need to cover the burn to keep it clean). 6. Consider reviewing the person at 2-3 days, to reassess the condition of the burn and advise whether any further wound management is necessary (this may best be done by the practice or district nurse). 7. As the burn heals the use of an emollient may soothe and ease itching. 8. Pain relief with paracetamol is usually adequate. The addition of a weak opioid, such as codeine, may be useful for more severe pain. <heading>Tetanus prophylaxis</heading>For all wounds, check tetanus immunization status. <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading>'s parents have been kept informed about the investigations being undertaken.
