<list></list><heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>The Human body is an unimaginably complex organization and integration of complex sub-systems ranging from the cells to the organ systems. The more complex the organization gets, the tougher it is to control and co-ordinate the various activities that they perform. The Neurological system has been designed in the human body for the function of control and coordination by electrical and chemical signals. The importance of Neurological sciences has also widened with the advent of Biological psychology that holds the Nervous system and Endocrine system responsible for the behaviour of the organism including emotion, cognition, motivation, etc. <abstract><heading>ABSTRACT</heading>In this paper, we analyse the various components of the Neurological system, their anatomy and functioning in a fairly detailed manner. The components of the neurological system i.e. the central nervous system comprising of the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system are explained along with an account of their sections by virtue of location, function, etc. We then look at the various techniques that are employed for scanning the brain. In this section regarding the various brain scanning techniques, there is a comprehensive account of the basic principle on which they work, their uses, applications and limitations. We also discuss future applications of brain scanning and other discoveries relating to the neurological system. </abstract><heading>COMPONENTS</heading>There are 2 major subdivisions of the neurological system The Central Nervous System comprising of the brain protected by the cranium or the enclosing part of the skull and spinal cord protected by the vertebral column or the back bone. The Peripheral Nervous System comprises of bundles of nerve cells combined to form nervous tissues. The run from the central nervous system to the various organs carrying signals across them. These nerve cells or neurons form knot like concentrated areas called Ganglions. <heading>NEURONS  (Nerve Cells) [2, 6, 10]</heading><picture/>Picture Ref:  URL  Neurons are the functional units of the Neurological system. They are responsible for receiving, processing and transmitting information across the human body. They are characterized by three major properties EXCITABILITY - These cells get excited by responding to the external environmental changes called stimuli. CONDUCTIVITY - These cells also respond to the stimuli by conducting and sending across signals to various cells located even at distant locations SECRETION - When the electrical signal reaches the end of the nerve fibres it secretes a chemical neurotransmitter that stimulates the next cell. There are roughly about 100 billion neurons in the human body. Their structure is similar to any other cell in the body except that they have a few other modifications to aide them in performing their electrochemical functions. The Neuron Consists of The Cell Body - This part of the neuron is similair to the normal cells of the body that contain the various organelles like the cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, etc.It is the Centre of life of the neuron. Axon - It is a long cable like projection emerging from the cell body. It is responsible for carrying the electrochemical message across the cell. The Axon of the Neurons present in the peripheral Nervous system is insulated with layers of fat for insulation so that the electrochemical signal can be conducted more effectively. But the neurons present in the central Nervous system are not insulated. This insulation of fat is called Myelin. These conduct outgoing signals from the Cell body. Dendrites - These are small branch like projections from the cell that aide the call in communicating with the other cells and in creating stimuli by perceiving the environment. These conduct the incoming signals to the cell body. Nodes of Ranvier - The Myelin sheath has interruptions along its length to prevent ion leakage and these are the actual spots on the nerve where signal transfers take place. <heading>CLASSIFICATION</heading>Neurons can be classified under various parameters like size, Function, Location, etc. <heading>SIZE</heading>The neurons in the human body are present in a range of different sizes. For e.g. the sensory neurons present in the fingertip range across the entire arm while the neurons in the brain are much smaller. This could actually be an adaptive modification in order to perform the required function more effectively and efficiently. <heading>FUNCTION</heading>SENSORY NEURONS - They carry signals from the external environment to the central nervous. MOTOR NEURONS - These are Neurons that are responsible for the transmission of signals from the Central Nervous system to the muscles and glands of the body. RECEPTORS - These are the nerves present in the sensory organs that aide in detecting and perceiving the external environmental factors like light, sound, touch, etc. INTERNEURONS - These connect the various neurons that are present in the Central Nervous system. <heading>FUNCTION</heading>The ability of the Neuron cells to conduct electrical signals is due to the resting potential of the Neuron cells. The inner part of the cell membrane has a different electrical potential when compared to the outer part or in other words the two sides of the cell membrane. In the picture below, one end of the voltmeter is connected to the inner part of the cell while the other part is placed outside and it shows a negative potential of -70mV.Hence the inner part of the neuron is slightly negative with respect to the outside and this potential difference is called the resting potential because it is the potential difference in the cell when no signals flow through it. The resting potential of a neuron is normally of the order of -70 mV to -65mV. <picture/>Picture Ref:  URL  This potential difference is produced by the positive ions of sodium and potassium. There are carrier mechanisms that constantly transport the sodium ions from the interior to the exterior part of the cell membrane and the potassium ions are transported from the exterior to the interior part of the cell membrane. This transport mechanism is called the sodium potassium pump. There are sodium and potassium gate on the surface of the cell membrane that allow the diffusion of the sodium and potassium ions across them respectively. During resting potential, all the sodium gates are closed while a very few potassium gated remain open. Hence there are a lot of potassium ions inside the cell membrane while there are a lot of sodium ions along with a few potassium ions outside the cell membrane. <heading>POLARISATION</heading>During an action potential caused by a stimulus, all the sodium gates open up and the sodium ions surrounding the region diffuse into the membrane causing a depolarization of the exterior of the cell membrane while the interior gets positively charged or acquires a positive potential. All the potassium gates on the membrane then open up causing all the potassium ions to flow to the exterior of the cell. This depolarizes the cell membrane. This action potential causes the potential difference of the cell membrane to rise to about 30mV. <picture/>Ref:  URL  Then the potassium channels on the cell membrane open up causing the potassium ions to flow out and restore the positive charge outside the membrane. This is called repolarisation and this process restores the potential difference of the neuron back to its resting potential. b Picture Ref:  URL  <picture/>Picture Ref:  URL  The picture above shows the action potential. The potential rises up to a positive value as the sodium gates open up and is gradually restored to its resting potential as the potassium gates open up. There is a minimum stimulus required to open the sodium channels completely and this is called the threshold stimulus. <heading>ALL OR NONE LAW</heading>The Neurons are also governed by the all or none law by which the neurons either achieve complete action potential or do not achieve any potential at all. There can nothing like a weak potential. <heading>SPINAL CORD [20, 28,31]</heading>The Spinal cord is the main structural support of the entire human body and also acts as the pathway for nerve signals. It comprises of 33 bones called vertebrae, 31 pairs of nerves, 40 muscles and numerous other connecting fibres called Tendons and Ligaments. There are numerous fibrous cartilages between the vertebrae called discs. These provide cushioning for the bones when the spinal cord moves. The Nervous system is also considered to be made of 2 different types of matter Grey Matter that processes the information and the white matter that contains connections. The spinal cord is made of a central cellular area surrounded by nerve fibre tracts. The central Grey matter can be divided into a series of layers. Dorsal Horn Layers - It is a pathway for signals relating to pain, temperature and crude touch. The Ventral Columns - It is made of a pool of motor neurons activating and feeding signals to skeletal muscles. Intermedio-Lateral Column - It lies in between the other two columns and contains preganglionic nerves. The white matter surrounding the grey matter can be further classified into <list>Posterior FunichulusLateral FunichulusAnterior Funichulus</list>There are also grooves that run along the length of the spinal cord, the major ones being <list>posterior median sulcusposterolateral sulcus anterior median fissure anterolateral sulcus posterior intermediate sulcus</list><picture/>Picture Reference:  URL  The sensory Receptors in the skin send signals to the spinal cord through the spinal nerves. The cell bodies of these neurons are located in the Dorsal root Ganglion, shown in the picture above. Some neurons make synapses or Junctions producing chemical signals with the Dorsal Horn while others connect directly to the brain. Many neuron cell bodies in the Ventral horn have axons that extend across to the muscles to control and co-ordinate movement. <picture/>Picture Ref:  URL  The white matter in the spinal cord has sensory tracts ascending in it which can be classified into Dorsal Column - This is the largest tract in the spinal cord and is responsible for sending signals regarding pressure, position and tactile to the sensory area of the cerebral cortex. Spinothalamic tracts - This can be further divided into two parts. The lateral Spinothalamic tract sends signals regarding pain and thermal sense while the anterior spinothalamic tract sends signals regarding light touch. Spinocerebellar Tracts - These are large diameter fibres that are responsible for muscle toning during a subconscious state of mind. Descending Spinal Tracts like rubrospinal tract, the vestibulospinal tract, and the reticulospinal tract are concerned with signals relating to voluntary motor function, muscle tone, reflexes and equilibrium, visceral innervation. Corticospinal Tract Rubrospinal tract Vestibulospinal Tract Reticulospinal Tract <heading>THE BRAIN</heading>The Brain is perhaps the most complicated structure in the entire universe however unreliable and unpredictable it sometimes is. There are about 100 billion neurons cells in the brain with each neuron connected to 10,000 other neurons. It can often be an absolutely unimaginable and complex. It handles millions of electrical and chemical messages every second. The brain constitutes only 2% of a person's body mass but it still consumes a fourth of the total oxygen consumption of the person. [1]In a more specific and biological manner, the brain can be divided into the Cerebrum - It constitutes 83% of the brain's volume and is divided into two hemispheres. Each of these hemispheres has thick folds called gyri and these are separated by shallow grooves called Sulci. Cerebellum - This part lies below the cerebrum. It constitutes 10% of the brain's volume but contains more than 50% of the total neurons in the brain. It's a cauliflower shaped part that is responsible for coordination within the human body. It mainly performs the functions of muscular coordination and motor control but it also plays a role in a few other processes like judging the passage of time, awareness and memory. It is sometimes referred to as the brain's autopilot. It is also responsible for enabling us to carry out multi tasking eg. Walking and chewing simultaneously. Brain Stem - This is considered to be the fairly simplest part of the human brain and is considered to be responsible for performing the involuntary functions like Breathing, Heartbeat, Blood Pressure control, etc. Limbic System - This is a part buried within the cerebrum and is considered to be responsible for controlling the emotions, attitude and other personality traits of the individual. It is also responsible for sensing smell as it is connected to the olfactory nerves in the nasal cavity. Insula - This part of the cerebrum is still a mystery as it lies deep beneath the brain and hence scanning and studying it can be fairly complicated. It is believed to be responsible to Intuition and emotions. <heading>THE CEREBRUM [26]</heading>Most scientists believe that the cerebrum is the region where most mental activities take place. The cerebrum is broadly divided into 2 hemispheres - The right brain and the Left brain. It is believed that the right brain controls the reflexes of the left side of the body and the left brain controls the reflexes on the right side of the body. It is believed that the right brain controls Logic and language while the left brain controls creativity and orientation. Each of these sections is believed to be made of an inner core made of white matter and an outer wrinkled layer called the cortex that's made of gray matter. The cortex can be divided into 6 sections and most of the cerebral activity takes place here. The functional units of the cortex are columns of neurons. Although all these neurons are assigned specific tasks, most of them are devoted to communicating within themselves. <picture/>Picture Ref:  URL  [2, 14]The cortex can be divided into various components by virtue of their function. Frontal Lobe - It is believed to be the part of the cerebrum responsible for maintaining self control like aiding in controlling strong urges like anger, sexual impulse, sorrow, and etc.It also plays an important role in planning, implementing plans, decision making and controlling other behavioural aspects. People with a disorder in the frontal lobes undergo sever personality disorders. Parietal Lobe - It is the part of the cerebrum that aides in movement, perception of stimuli and orientation. Occipital Lobe - This part of the cerebrum deals with the processing of information from the eyes. It deals with the various aspects of vision like colour, light and movement. Temporal Lobe - This part of the cerebrum is located inside the skull just above the ears. It is responsible for interpreting the signals sent by the auditory nerves and the receptors in the ear. It also plays a role in memory. There are a couple of other areas in the cerebrum that are of special importance in the recent past due to new discoveries. Boca's Area - It is the area that is believed to store and maintain a list of words that the brain uses to communicate it's thoughts in those words. Wernickes Area - It is the area that is believed to comprehend the incoming language either in the form of speech or text. It is also partly responsible for aiding short term memory. <heading>MEASURING BRAIN ACTIVITY [29, 30]</heading>The frequency of the electrical signals obtained from the mind can help us detect the state of the person's mind. The different states are <list>Alpha Activity (7-12 Hertz) - This indicates a relaxed statebeta activity (13-30 Hz) indicates alertnessTheta activity (4-8 Hertz) - It is the state of mind normally attained during sleep and is characteristic of the subconscious self.Delta activity (0.5 - 4 Hertz) - It is characteristic of the unconscious self and is responsible for intuition, intellectual insight, etc.</list>This indicator is measured using EEG.The technique is described in detail in a later part of this paper. The Brain Performance can also be detected by measuring the cerebral blood flow and the glucose & hence the oxygen required to metabolise it consumed by the various neurons or regions of the brain.MRI exploits this indicator to scan the brain. <heading>SCANNING TECHNIQUES</heading><heading>EEG (Electroencalphography) [18]</heading><picture/>Picture Reference:  URL  <heading>PRINCIPLE</heading>It works on the principle of picking up the electrical signals produced by the rhythmic oscillation of the neurons in the brain. <heading>PROCEDURE</heading><picture/>Picture Reference:  URL  It is a fairly Non Invasive method of measuring the brain's performance. It consists of electrodes hooked on to the scalp. The electrodes pick up the electrical signals naturally produced by the brain. These electrodes are then connected to a galvanometer which is an instrument used to detect very small currents. <heading>ADVANTAGES/APPLICATIONS</heading>It can detect the mental state of person like sleep, anaesthised, awake, etc. It is used to scan brain damage, epilepsy and other problems. <heading>LIMITATIONS</heading>Physical movement of the subject can cause the electrodes to move causing a variation in the amplitude of the output signals. <heading>CAT (Computer Axial Tomography)</heading><picture/>Picture Ref:  URL  <heading>PRINCIPLE [25]</heading>This scan uses a series of different X-Rays to combine them and produce a 3-Dimensional image of the brain rather than the conventional X rays that produce simple 2 dimensional images. <heading>PROCEDURE [17, 25]</heading>The subject is introduced into a doughnut shaped X-Ray machine that moves around the subject and records a lot of 2D X-Ray images. The donut shaped hole has X-Ray tubes along its edges with receptors in the opposite direction. Hence as the tubes complete one rotation, the scan the image of a slice of a brain. This hole then goes around a spiral path, emitting X-Rays of optimum intensity depending on the type of tissues. Thus it obtains many images of think slices of the brain. Then a computer combines these images to form a 3D image. <heading>ADVANTAGES/APPLICATIONS [17, 25]</heading>This view is more comprehensive than the conventional X-Rays in analyzing the brain. It can be used to detect damages in the brain and it can also be used to detect the cerebral blood flow when the subject is performing a task. The cerebral blood flow is a measure of the brain activity. It readily detects bleeding. <heading>LIMITATIONS [21]</heading>It fails to depict the precise details of soft tissues, especially the brain. It can't depict membrane formations and inflammations in the brain. It does not detect the malformations of the arteries and veins. <heading>PET (Positron Emission Tomography)</heading><picture/>Picture Ref:  URL  <heading>PRINCIPLE [24]</heading>This scanning is based on a theory that the brain cells that are more active absorb glucose and metabolise more rapidly than the relatively inactive cells. <heading>PROCEDURE [24]</heading>In this process, the subject is injected with a small quantity of radioactive glucose. The instrument then measures the amount of radiations emitted from the various parts of the brain to calibrate the amount of glucose adsorbed by the various parts of the brain. This calibration is then used by the computer to create a colour coded image depicting the level of adsorption of glucose of the various parts of the brain. A red colured zone depicts good adsorption and active cells while blue zones depict low adsorption and hence the presence of inactive cells. <heading>ADVANTAGES/APPLICATIONS [24]</heading>The PET imaging software enables cross sectional scanning and viewing of the brain. Thus this feature enables PET to have an edge over other scanning processes by allowing researchers to study the structures deep inside the brain. <heading>LIMITATIONS [24] </heading>Since this process involves injecting radioactive material into the blood stream, a person is not allowed to take any more than 12 scans per year. <heading>MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)</heading><heading>PRINCIPLE [19]</heading>This scan works on the principle that an external magnetic field can be used to align the protons in the body to one direction and this causes their magnetic moments of most of the protons cancel out due to their spin in different directions - clockwise or anti clockwise along the same normal. However there still remain some protons whose magnetic moments do not cancel out. These are excited to higher energy levels and made to spin rapidly by sending a radio pulse and as they return to their ground state, they emit the energy. This energy serves as the signal for the MRI instrument. A computer then processes the signals and differentiates the various types of tissues. <picture/>Picture Ref:  URL  <heading>PROCEDURE [19]</heading>In this process, the subject is introduced into a huge and powerful magnet of the MRI machine. This is a non invasive method and does not involve injecting any stuff into the blood stream either. It produces images of a very high resolution. It is also more effective in studying the brain and detecting damages or malfunctioning. <heading>ADVANTAGES/APPLICATIONS [23]</heading>It is used to detect tumours, especially in the brain and in the other soft cells in the spinal cord as well. This image can then be used by the physicians to locate the area during surgery. It is used to analyse blood flow patterns and blood vessel abnormalities. <heading>LIMITATIONS [23]</heading>Some People with implanted devices in their body like pacemaker, artificial lungs or metal objects like artificial teeth cannot undergo the scanning as it would cause a very strong magnetic field. This scan requires the subject to be absolutely stationary so some people would have to be sedated in order to ensure this. <heading>FURTHER WORK AND FUTURE APPLICATIONS</heading>Neurology and Brain scanning are the best fields in Biomedical Engineering that possess immense potential for further work and future applications. Although there has been a lot of research and discovery about the functioning of the human brain, the working and structure of the brain is still an unraveled mystery to an extent. If the various activities of the brain like thoughts, behaviour, orientation, control, etc can be comprehended and translated into signals (electrical, magnetic or any other form), it would enable Psychiatrists and Neurologists to analyse neurological and psychological problems including their cause and remedy. <heading>Identifying Criminals [27]</heading>The brain produces involuntary signals in a persons brain when he watches images relating to a crime and if the waves of the associated thoughts can he comprehended, it would enable us to detect if an accused man is guilty or not.
