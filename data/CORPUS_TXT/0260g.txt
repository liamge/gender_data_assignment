Came into hospital on the bus. <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background. The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading>The patient was seen post operatively, but was able to give me a history of her condition before she had her operation and treatment. <heading>Presenting Complaint </heading>Shortness of breath and a cough. <heading>History of Presenting Complaint</heading>Presented to cardiology outpatients in December 2003, with a persistent dry cough and shortness of breath. An ECHO (echocardiogram) was performed. It was discovered that the patient had aortic regurgitation, with an early diastolic murmur, radiating to the neck. The left ventricular systolic function was good and an operation to insert a prosthetic valve was planned. <heading>Upon presentation to hospital for operation .</heading>The shortness of breath and wheeze present for most of the time, waking the patient approximately twice every night. To sleep the patient needed four pillows and was unable to lie flat without getting breathless. Patient also experienced some night sweats. The patient reported that her ankles were never swollen. Cough was persistent, phlegm was white and frothy mainly brought up at night. Exercise tolerance was 50 yards on the flat. No chest Pain, palpitations, intermittent claudication, cold/blue hands or feet and no syncope. <heading>Past Medical History</heading>Hypertension (unknown when this was diagnosed) Hypothyroidism (Diagnosed and treated since 1991) Appendicectomy (1960) Voice Problems (2002), Received speech therapy for 7 months.

The patient has a good social network and normally manages to do everything for herself. Recently has had some help with cleaning and shopping due to the shortness of breath. <heading>Systems Review</heading>RS and CVS, see history of presenting complaint GIT No indigestion, abdominal pain, changes in bowel habit, problems with swallowing, heartburn or nausea and vomiting. Weight loss of approximately 7lbs since being in hospital and the patient's appetite has been reduced since being admitted. GUT Some stress incontinence when coughing but no other urinary symptoms CNS Occasional migraine, Some dizziness since admission, No faints, fits or blackout. <heading>Analysis of history The most likely single cause of the presentation, other possible causes and reasons for these choices. The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>The cause for the presenting complaint is already known as the patient is an elective admission and was seen post operatively. The incompetent aortic valve allows regurgitation of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle during diastole. This produced the early diastolic murmur seen at the cardiology clinic. The patient was experiencing shortness of breath, orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea due to oedema. Oedema arises because the incompetence of the aortic valve leads to an increased workload for the left ventricle. In response to this the cardiac cells hypertrophy and the hydrostatic pressure increases in the pulmonary circulation resulting in fluid accumulation in the lungs. As the operation was successful and a soft prosthetic aortic valve fitted upon examination I would expect to find that the patients symptoms had been relieved. I would not expect to find an early diastolic murmur, visible carotid pulsations or a JVP. I would expect the apex beat of the heart to be slightly displaced due to its increased workload in the time leading up to Mrs 's operation. <heading>Physical examination and mental state examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading><heading>General Examination (carried out post operatively)</heading>The patient was an elderly slightly overweight lady, sitting comfortably in bed. Mrs  was alert and feeling quite well. Around the bed was a sputum pot (empty), oxygen mask, no walking aids. Inspection of the hands showed them to be normal temperature and not clammy. Skin showed no signs of dehydration. No Clubbing, peripheral cyanosis were noted. Bruising to both wrists from canula put in for operation. Pulse 68 bpm upon admission it was 60 bpm Blood Pressure Lying down 140/70 standing 113/60 and upon admission it was 170/60 No Xanthelasma seen on the face. No Jaundice seen in sclera of the eye. Conjunctiva a little pale. No central cyanosis Appearance of the tongue was normal No Lymphadenopathy or thyroid enlargement No Pedal Oedema <heading>CVS Examination</heading><heading>Inspection</heading>The patient was quite comfortable, she felt a little tenderness and discomfort in her chest due to the stitch's and scar but had no breathlessness or cough. Median sternotomy scar present, stitches still in. No varicose veins in the legs. Patient was wearing post operative support stockings. <heading>Palpation</heading>Apex Beat was felt in the 5 th intercostal space but slightly displaced to the left. JVP not raised. All peripheral pulses were present. <heading>Auscultation</heading>1 st and 2 nd heart sounds heard in mitral, tricuspid, pulmonic and aortic regions. A sharp closing sound could be heard in S2 due to the closure of the prosthetic valve. ICE - Would like to go home very soon and resume normal activities. <heading>Analysis of history and examination Reasons for your choice of the cause of the patient's problem(s) and any other cause that still needs to be considered at this stage</heading>The examination supported the fact that the operation was a success. The patient's symptoms had been relieved and no early diastolic murmur could be heard. The apex beat was slightly displaced due to the increased demand on the left ventricle pre intervention. A significant decrease in Mrs 's blood pressure has also been achieved. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>Having undergone a successful major surgical operation. Mrs  is anxious to continue her post operative recovery at home. This should be possible provided that she has enough support to do so. Psychologically Mrs  is concerned as to whether she will recover completely to her pre morbid state and whether she will be able to cope as before, doing everything for herself. <heading>Management</heading><heading>Investigations</heading>Monitor vital signs (such as pulse, blood pressure, electrolytes and temperature) to ensure that she doesn't develop any post operative complications such as a blood clot. <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading>Keep the patient informed of when it is realistically likely that they will be able to go home. Ensure that they are aware of how long it may take them to recover and encourage them not to do too much too quickly. <heading>Prescription/medical intervention</heading>Review medication and aftercare regularly to ensure the patient is recovering as fast as possible. Ensure that Mrs  has enough support in the community and that any help she may need with daily tasks is arranged. Ensure that she is followed up by her GP and via outpatients at the hospital. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading>From this case I have seen for the first time, a heart valve lesion and also that major surgery can be performed successfully on an older patient, significantly improving the quality of their life.
