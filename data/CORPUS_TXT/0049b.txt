<abstract><heading>Abstract</heading>This essay starts by introducing some basic differential and algebraic topology. We then move into more advanced areas such as the various characteristic classes. The algebraic topology, which takes up much of the essay, is approached from an algebraist viewpoint. We take time to appreciate the algebraic structure of cohomology including group cohomology although we develop the main ideas in the form of De Rham cohomology from differential forms. We also take a quick look at an application of cohomology to representation theory. After preparing ourselves, we give a sketch of the proof of an interesting theorem we wish to explore. This work is quite wide-ranging and we content ourselves with giving an introduc-tion to the main thread which involves the development of Yang-Mills moduli spaces. The theorem has a corollary that tells us that there are 'exotic' 4-manifolds, which are homotopy equivalent but not diffeomorphic to any complex surface. The essay is presented in three chapters - the first two covering topics from smooth manifolds to cohomology and Poincare duality. The second chapter discusses applications of what was discussed in the first - operations on vector bundles and the treatment of characteristic classes. The final section give an in-depth discussion of the main theorem and a sketch of the proof. This is one of the more interesting facts in contemporary research in differential topology. Simon Donaldson proved this in the early eighties and won the Fields' Medal in 1984 for his efforts. It is definitely one of the more intensive research topics which have led to the Fields' Medal. For example, although the proof of Monstrous Moonshine by Borcherds was a momentous achievement, the sheer volume of background knowledge required for this topological work is breathtaking. We aim to give a good introduction to some of this mathematics which runs through Kahler manifolds to ASD connections. </abstract> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA <heading>Chapter 1 Manifolds to Duality</heading><heading>1.1 Local Behaviour of Smooth Maps on Manifolds and an Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</heading>Manifolds will be important to us throughout the discussion of cohomology and later. This gives an opportunity to discuss the interesting idea that we want to explore in full. If n = 4, a four-manifold can be constructed that is topologically equivalent but not differentiably equivalent to the Euclidean four-manifold. When considered carefully, this is quite a stunning statement. As if it weren't fascinating enough that we can construct such "exotic" manifolds but moreover, this is only true for n = 4! The proper statement is a corollary of a long and complicated theorem which we will soon develop. First, we need some familiarity with topological reasoning. Topology is a study of the properties of a space that remain the same under homeomorphism. Familiarity with topology and some differential topology is assumed so we discuss this point briefly, so that we may move quickly to cohomology and more algebraic ideas. A homeo-morphism is a bijective, continuous function with continuous inverse. It can be thought of as the correspondence between the point of spaces A and B when we deform A into B. A manifold will be defined more accurately below but we can think of it in a simple way as a topological space in which the small bit surrounding each point can be compared to an Euclidean space. For example, the torus is a manifold since each point lies in a slightly curved area that can be deformed into a disk in the plane, but the cone is not a manifold since the neighbourhood of its vertex can not be deformed into a piece of the Euclidean plane. We give results that we need later as well as a few other interesting results. For an open set  FORMULA , a mapping  FORMULA  is smooth(1) if it has continuous partial derivatives of all orders. For  FORMULA , with  FORMULA  not open,is smooth(2) if it can be locally extended to smooth(1) map on open sets. In other words, if around  FORMULA  there exists an open set  FORMULA  and a smooth(1) map  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  on  FORMULA . A smooth(2) map  FORMULA , for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA , is a differomorphism if it is bijective with  FORMULA  also smooth(2). X and Y are diffeomorphic if there exists such an f. Equipped with the above we can now define smooth manifolds. A k-dimensional smooth manifold is a subset  FORMULA  which is locally diffeomorphic to  FORMULA  - for now we will call X a k-dimensional manifold . This means that for each  FORMULA , there is a neighbourhood V which is diffeomorphic to an open set  FORMULA . The diffeomorphism  FORMULA  is known as a parametrization. This makes the n-manifold very interesting to those who are exploring Euclidean n-dimensional spaces [GP74, M74]. Example 1. We can show that the circle  FORMULA is a 1-manifold. First suppose y > 0, then  FORMULA  is a bijection of the open interval  FORMULA onto the upper semicircle. Its inverse is smooth extending to a smooth map  FORMULA . So  FORMULA is a diffeomorphism. This map and  FORMULA  parametrize S1 except around the points  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . For these points we use  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  mapping  FORMULA  to the left and right semicircles. So by covering it with parametrizations, we have shown that the circle is a 1-manifold. We can use the same argument to show that the n-sphere  FORMULA is an n-manifold. Suppose that  FORMULA  for FORMULA , then  FORMULA  for  FORMULA is a bijection from  FORMULA onto the n-sphere above the FORMULA -axis. Its inverse extend to a smooth map  FORMULA  so φis a parametrization. We proceed as in the previous case, to give local parametrizations about all pints except the axis points. of which there are 2n. We can cover these with new parametrizations, as above, finally covering the n-sphere in 2n + 2 parametrizations. So then the n-sphere in  FORMULA is a n-manifold. Now for an enlightening proposition, Theorem 2. Every point in X, a k-dimensional manifold, has a neighbourhood diffeomorphic to all ofM,k. Proof: Let  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . The map  FORMULA  defined by  FORMULA  is a diffeomorphism of  FORMULA  onto  FORMULA . We see that there is a bijection from  FORMULA  to  FORMULA  and that  FORMULA  can be locally extended to a smooth map on open sets and is therefore smooth. Let X be a k-manifold, so each  FORMULA  posseses a neighbourhood V which is diffeomorphic to U open in  FORMULA . Then we can take U diffeomorphic to all of  FORMULA , in which case so is V since diffeomorphism holds under composition. • We recall that the derivative of f at x, denoted dxf, is the best linear approximation of f. That is, dxf is the unique map with the property  FORMULA . We suppose  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  is a local parametrization for V open in  FORMULA . Let f(0) = x, then  FORMULA . The tangent space at the point x of a manifold  FORMULA  .is the image of  FORMULA , denoted  FORMULA . A tangent vector to X at x is a point v lying in  FORMULA , a vector subspace of  FORMULA . There exists a slight ambiguity about whether different local parametrizations will give the same tangent space.Take  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and we may assume that f(V) = g(U). Now  FORMULA  is a diffeomorphism. Write  FORMULA  and differentiate to get  FORMULA . This implies that  FORMULA . We can reverse f,g giving  FORMULA  so  FORMULA  is well defined. We can then show that  FORMULA  has dimension M. Let W be an open set in  FORMULA  and choose a smooth map  FORMULA , extending f _1.  FORMULA  the identity map of V. The chain rules gives the identity map of  FORMULA  as  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  is an isomorphism, so the dimension of  FORMULA  is M. The derivative of a smooth map of manifolds  FORMULA  at a point x is a linear transformation  FORMULA  for f(x) = y [GP74]. This derivative can be shown to satisfy the chain rule (any text of manifolds). We also see that it is the same as the usual derivative for maps on Euclidean space. Let  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  parametrise X,Y about x,y for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA , FORMULA . For appropriate U,  FORMULA  giving  FORMULA . We can show that this definition is independent of parametrization. Let  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  with  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Assume  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . The maps  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  are diffeomorphisms. Then independence follows. A local diffeomorphism f at x is a smooth map  FORMULA  of manifolds X, Y that carries a neighbourhood of x diffeomorhically onto a neighbourhood of f(x) = y [M88]. Theorem 3. (Inverse function Theorem) Suppose that  FORMULA  is a smooth map with dxf at x being an isomorphism. Then f is a local diffeomorphism at x. We have seen many interpretations and proofs of the IFT before. However we apply it, is is an amazing result. If dimX < dimY we have  FORMULA  injective at best. If this is true, f is an immersion at x. The canonical immersion is the inclusion of  FORMULA  into  FORMULA . Theorem 4. (Local Immersion Theorem) Suppose that  FORMULA  is an immersion at x and that f(x) = y. Then f is locally equivalent to the canonical immersion near x. Sketch of Proof: The proof works very simply by taking  FORMULA  and constructing a map  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . We find that we can apply the IFT (old) to G and that it is a diffeomorphism from some neighbourhood of  FORMULA  to a neighbourhood of  FORMULA . We have  FORMULA  where c is the canonical submersion. Then we take a new parametrization on X around x to show that f is locally equivalent to c. [M05] • A map is proper if the preimage of every compact set is compact. An immersion that is injective and proper is an embedding. The next theorem is proved in [GP74]. Theorem 5. An embedding is a diffeomorphism of X onto a submanifold ofY. f is a submersion at x if  FORMULA  is surjective. The canonical submersion is the projection of  FORMULA  onto  FORMULA . Then we have the following theorem - a proof is omitted but is analogous to the local immersion theorem. Theorem 6. (Local Submersion Theorem) Suppose that  FORMULA  is a submersion at x and that f(x) = y. Then f is locally equivalent to the canonical submersion near x. For  FORMULA , the ıpreimage of y,  FORMULA , is the subset of X containing x such that f(x) = y. A regular value for f is a  FORMULA  such that for  FORMULA  and x such that f(x) = y,  FORMULA  is surjective. A critical value is one which is not regular. Theorem 7. If y is a regular value of the submersion  FORMULA  then FORMULA  is a submanifold of X with  FORMULA . Proof: Let  FORMULA  and y corresponds to  FORMULA . Near x, FORMULA  is the set  FORMULA  -  FORMULA  is the set of points  FORMULA  where the set of  FORMULA  is defined on  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  form a coordinate system on  FORMULA . This is an open subset of  FORMULA . So we see that  FORMULA  is a submanifold of X with  FORMULA .[GP74, M88]• A map  FORMULA  is transversal to the submanifold  FORMULA  if  FORMULA  for all  FORMULA  [GP74]. A manifold X is simply connected if X is connected and every map from the circle  FORMULA  to X is homotopic to a constant. This is a generalization of regularity which proves useful in the study of smooth manifolds. A set  FORMULA  has measure zero if, for every  FORMULA , there exists a countable collection of rectangular solids  FORMULA  in  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Study of transversality and intersection is very important in some areas of research involving manifolds. Indeed, the class of objects to be studied is enlarged by considering manifolds with boundary, spaces which may fail to be manifolds. A manifold with boundary is defined as a subset Z C R n with a neighbourhood for each point that is diffeomorphic to an open set of the upper half-space  FORMULA  in  FORMULA . The boundary  FORMULA  is the set of points of the image of the boundary of  FORMULA . under such a local parametrization. Theorem 8. (Sard's Theorem) For a smooth map of manifolds  FORMULA , the set of critical values of f has measure zero [M05]. This leads to an interesting result - the Whitney embedding theorem. A k-manifold s, by definition, a subset of some Euclidean space  FORMULA  for what n does  FORMULA  contain a differomorphic copy of every k-manifold. An useful object in proving this theorem is the tangent bundle,  FORMULA . Theorem 9. The tangent bundle of a manifold is another manifold and  FORMULA . Proof: Let  FORMULA  be an open set and hence a manifold. Then  FORMULA  and we see  FORMULA  is open in  FORMULA 's topology since  FORMULA  is open in  FORMULA . Take a local parametrization  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  an open set and then  FORMULA  is a diffeomorphism.  FORMULA  parametrizes the open set  FORMULA  since  FORMULA . Then every point of  FORMULA  is in such a neighbourhood.[GP74]• Now we can prove the first of Whitney's theorems, proof of which is discussed in most books on the subject. Theorem 10. Every k-manifold admits an injective immersion in  FORMULA .[GP74, M88, M05]. Sketch of Proof: If  FORMULA  is of k dimensions,  FORMULA , we produce a linear projection  FORMULA  with a restriction to an injective immersion of X. Let  FORMULA  be an injective immersion with  FORMULA . Define a map  FORMULA  and a map  FORMULA  by  FORMULA .  FORMULA  so Sard's theorem implies that there exists  FORMULA  which is not in the image of either map. Let  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  and then  FORMULA  is injective. Suppose  FORMULA  but x=y and it is simple to show that this contradicts the choice of a, as does assuming that  FORMULA  is such that  FORMULA .• Whitney formulated two more results, refining the previous proof. Theorem 11. Every k-manifold embeds in  FORMULA . Theorem 12. Every k-manifold admits an injective immersion in  FORMULA . Now a few ideas we will need later. A Riemannian metric on a smooth manifold X is a collection of inner products on the tangent space  FORMULA  for all  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  is a smooth function on the set  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . A Riemannian manifold is a manifold with Riemannian structure [D903]. To close we look at the definition of a topological manifold. It is a manifold, a smooth manifold, missing a few properties. We define as follows. Recall that a topological space X is Hausdorff if  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  for distinct x, FORMULA  and U, V open in X. A topological Hausdorff space X is known as a n-dimensional topological manifold if it has countable basis for its topology and it is locally homeomorphic to  FORMULA  [MJ97]. <heading>1.2 Chain Complexes, Differential Forms on Smooth Manifolds, and Cohomology Groups</heading><heading>1.2.1 Homology Groups</heading>We assume familiarity with homology, so we give only basic definitions. A homotopy of continuous maps is a family  FORMULA , 0 < t < 1 such that  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  are independent of t and  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  is continuous. Two continuous maps  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  are homotopic,  FORMULA , when connected in this way. Homotopy can, of course, be shown to be an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes are called homotopy classes of f, [f]. A loop is a continuous map  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . The set of homotopy classes of f forms the fundamental group,  FORMULA . The fundamental group is an useful tool for studying and distinguishing between topological surfaces. This is because homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic fundamental groups. However, its usefulness does not extend to higher dimensions. So we construct the homology groups to serve this purpose. We are already familiar with this topic so we will revisit only the basic points. The n-simplex  FORMULA  is the smallest convex set in  FORMULA  containing n + 1 points. A simplical complex is a finite collection of simplexes in some Euclidean space, so that if a simplex lies in the collection so does each of its faces; and so that two intersecting simplexes belonging to the collection intersect in a common face. Let X be a finite simplical complex, and we assign to it a collection of groups called the simplical homology groups  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . If an edge of a polygonal curve has vertices v,w then (v,w) denotes an orientation of the edge from v to w. Then  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  when we have vertices v, u, w of a triangle of X with (u, v, w) denoting the orientation of ordering the vertices. The boundary of an oriented edge is defined by  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Let X be a finite simplical complex and let  FORMULA  be the free abelian group generated by the oriented simplexes, simplexes σ in X with orientation.  FORMULA  has elements  FORMULA  known as n-chains. Then the kth simplical homology group of X is given by  FORMULA  for a boundary homomorphism  FORMULA  defined by  FORMULA  where the hat in  FORMULA  means that the vertex  FORMULA  of the n-simplex is deleted. Theorem 13. The composition of maps  FORMULA  given by  FORMULA is equal to zero. Proof: We have,  FORMULA  (1.1) which zero since each terms appears twice with opposite sign.• The sequence  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  is called a chain complex.  FORMULA  implies  FORMULA  and we define the nth homology group of the chain complex as  FORMULA . When  FORMULA  we call this particular homology group the nth simplical homology group. These groups were discovered by Poincare. They were then generalized as below. Generally, homology is defined as follows. The singular homology group of X is denoted  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is as follows.  FORMULA -is a boundary map given by  FORMULA  as before where  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is an n-chain in  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  is a singular n-simplex meaning that  FORMULA  can have singularities in its image. A singular homology group is isomorphic to most other kinds of homology group. What we have said above tells us what a homology group in a rather abstract but it would be hard to form a clear picture from this. What is homology actually about? The homology group is just an Abelian group that 'counts' the number of holes in a given topological space - the places where there is some disconnectivity in the space. In the case of singular homology, a measure of the hole structure of a space is formed by the groups. So this answers the question that I have often been asked 'What information does a homology group contain?'. When you are using cohomology to manipulate some algebraic construction it is used in a mechanical way, as is also true for homology above. The question above is modified to yes, but what is cohomology and why do you waste time finding out?. Of course, as we find out below, cohomology of some topological space is an invariant that is dual to homology so you can think of it as finding holes in this space. As I have discussed, my opinion is that algebraists generally have even less of an idea what homology is about, perhaps due to over-specialization. Cohomology, we will se later, is a graded ring and so has more algebraic structure than homology - so it has many more uses. The question here is the philosophical one of whether such over-specialization is good for mathematics as a whole? Obviously, specialization is necessary but the question to ask is whether we should be in a situation where homology and cohomology are used on a daily basis by people who have no sense of what they mean. It's a bit like a claim to understand Mozart's 23rd Piano Concerto just because you can play the piano. <heading>1.2.2 Cohomology Vector Spaces</heading>Cohomology is defined in a similar way to homology. We start with the vector space case. Let there be a sequence  FORMULA C is called exact when  FORMULA , an exact sequence. Let the sequence of vector spaces and linear maps  FORMULA  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  be called a chain complex. For a chain complex, then we define the ınth cohomology vector space to be  FORMULA . The elements of  FORMULA  are called n-cycles and elements of  FORMULA  are known as n-boundaries. The elements of H n are known as cohomology classes. Similar for the case for free abelian groups C n. A k-linear map  FORMULA , for V a vector space over K, is alternating if  FORMULA  when  FORMULA  for some  FORMULA . The space of alternating maps is denoted  FORMULA . We can write  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is a basis of V. If  FORMULA  we see  FORMULA . Theorem 14. If  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  then  FORMULA  Proof: Let  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  are fixed. Then  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  so  FORMULA . • For  FORMULA ,  FORMULA , the exterior product is  FORMULA  denoted  FORMULA ,. FORMULA . We have the following, proof given in [MJ97] Theorem 15. If  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  then  FORMULA . Theorem 16. A k-linear map is alternating if  FORMULA when some FORMULA  for  FORMULA . Proof: By Theorem 14 we have  FORMULA . •  FORMULA  is the exterior algebra of V. Theorem 17.  FORMULA  is an anti-commutative and connected graded algebra. Sketch of Proof: We prove anti-commutativity: if  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  then  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  and we have  FORMULA . We have  FORMULA  (1.2) Associativity is proved similarly and then we can see that connected is graded and connected.• A differential k-form ωon an open set  FORMULA  is a smooth map  FORMULA  [M05]. The vector space of such maps is  FORMULA . We can write  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  acting on points  FORMULA , an open set. The set  FORMULA  is a basis of  FORMULA  giving  FORMULA  . Then we can write  FORMULA  as  FORMULA . The exterior differential  FORMULA  is given by  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is the linear map given by  FORMULA  for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  being smooth functions of U and  FORMULA  is a basis of  FORMULA  for  FORMULA the dual basis of  FORMULA  from Theorem 14. We have from [H02, MJ97] Theorem 18. If FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and  FORMULA , we have  FORMULA . The exterior product on Ω (U) is induced from the usual one by defining  FORMULA . Theorem 19. For  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  we have  FORMULA . Proof:  FORMULA = FORMULA = FORMULA = FORMULA = FORMULA  (1.3) [MJ97]• <heading>1.2.3 Digression: Group Cohomology and Galois Cohomology</heading>Galois cohomology is basically summed up as a study of the application of homological algebra to modules of Galois groups. An M-automorphism of N is an automorphism with φ(m) = m for all  FORMULA . Recall that the Galois group  FORMULA  of the field extension N : M is the group of all M-automorphisms of N under the operation of composition - see [J04] for proof that the set of M-automorphisms is a group under composition. Let G be a group acting on H an abelian group. H is a G-module if the action g of G on H satisfies: <list>h1 = h;(h + h')9 = h9 + h'9. </list>As we discussed for cohomology vector spaces, the first cohomology group of H is the quotient group H1(G,H) = Z1(G, H)/B1(G, H). Taking  FORMULA  the groups of cochains, we have the group of cocycles  FORMULA  and the group of coboundaries  FORMULA . Let F be a field and F its algebraic closure [J04]. A discrete  FORMULA -module is an abelian group H which  FORMULA  acts upon such that the action is continuous on the discrete topology of H and the profinite topology of  FORMULA . The profinite topology is the topology of the profinite group - a topological group is profinite if it is isomorphic to the inverse limit of some projective system of finite groups. Then the first cohomology group follows after a bit more work. Say that a map is continuous if it is continuous for both the profinite topology on  FORMULA  and the discrete topology on H. We define the group of continuous cocycles  FORMULA  as being the group os continuous maps  FORMULA  satisfying  FORMULA . H is discrete so any coboundary is continuous. Then the first Galois cohomology group is  FORMULA . Theorem 20. Let  FORMULA be an exact sequence of G-modules. Then there is a long exact sequence  FORMULA where  FORMULA  is the cohomology class of the cocycle f in H1(G, A) for FORMULA . Sketch of Proof: We prove this in three steps: 1) First we show that  FORMULA  is exact. We have  FORMULA  so  FORMULA  for every cohomology class  FORMULA . Conversely, assume  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and then  FORMULA .  FORMULA  is surjective so there exists  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  so that  FORMULA . Then there exists  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . Since  FORMULA  is injective we can show that a is a k-cycle because  FORMULA . Then we have a cohomology class  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . 2) We now show that  FORMULA  is exact. First,  FORMULA . Conversely we follow a similar argument to above. 3) Similar argument to above to show that  FORMULA . • This extends to Galois modules or generalizes to chain complexes. In fact, most results in group cohomology will extend to Galois cohomology [MJ97, M05]. One question that has been asked of me is why Galois cohomology. The answer is that it has many applications in the theory of elliptic curves, although this is conveniently beyond the scope of this discussion. It is involved in the proof of the Mordell-Weil theorem saying that the Mordell-Weil group E(K) of elliptic curves on a number field K is finitely generated. Recall the definition of a Brauer group and their relation to associative division algebras [J05]. Another interesting fact is that these groups are homomorphic to the second Galois cohomology groups under certain conditions. Let A be an algebra over a commutative ring R. Then A/R is an Azumaya algebra if and only if A is faithful finitely generated as an R-module and the induced ring homomorphism  FORMULA  is an isomorphism. Theorem 21. A finite dimensional algebra A over the field F is central simple if and only if φA is an isomorphism. Sketch of Proof: If A is central simple then so is A and so is [J05]  FORMULA . Then φA must be injective surjectivity follows from checking dimensions. Conversely, we assume that φA is an isomorphism.  FORMULA  is central simple since it is a matrix algebra [J05]. We tensor an ideal of A by an ideal of  FORMULA  to get an ideal of  FORMULA .  FORMULA  is central for α central in A.  FORMULA  since EndF(A) is a matrix ring.• Let P be a commutative ring and G a finite group with elements acting as automorphisms on P. Suppose  FORMULA is a 2-cocycle into a group of units  FORMULA . From [J05, S98] we see that γ defines an element of  FORMULA . We can then define an algebra known as a crossed product on  FORMULA . It is possible to show from this that there is a homomorphism to  FORMULA  from  FORMULA . To be precise, we form the P-module  FORMULA , where  FORMULA  is the image of t under  FORMULA  for the polynomial ring P[t]. Theorem 22. There is an unique associative multiplication on ∆such that  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  [S98]. Take  FORMULA  - ∆ is an R algebra written  FORMULA  and we say that the  FORMULA  are the canonical elements of  FORMULA  associated to γ. If γ is 1 it is a 2-cocycle. The crossed product is then called trivial and is denoted  FORMULA . We then proceed to find  FORMULA  that allow us to construct Azumaya algebras. We find the P/R for which the trivial crossed product is Azumaya and this is enough to show that P/R is a Galois extension if and only if  FORMULA  is an Azumaya R-algebra. Theorem 23. Let P/R be a G-Galois extension. Then: i) Then FORMULA  is Brauer equivalent to  FORMULA ; ii) Suppose there are  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  for all  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA ; ii i) The crossed product construction defines a group homomorphism  FORMULA . Sketch of Proof: Let  FORMULA  and let  FORMULA  and let  FORMULA  be the seperating idempotent discussed in Chapter 2 of [S98], as an element of  FORMULA . Set  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  and so we take P as a subalgebra of A. We then show that if g = h then  FORMULA . So the conclusion is that A is spanned over S by the  FORMULA  and so  FORMULA . We have e the unique idempotent so  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  so we can show  FORMULA . Then there is an isomorphism  FORMULA . With a few facts regarding Brauer equivalence in [C02], this proves the theorem. Let  FORMULA  and let  FORMULA . Define  FORMULA  and letting ψ be the identity on P. f is a morphism of R-algebras and is an isomorphism since  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  are Azumaya algebras which can be proved to be isomorphic since they have the same rank so ii) is proved in this way. Then iii) is easy since i) shows that it is possible to define a homomorphism on the group of 2-cocycles and the fact that  FORMULA  is an isomorphism if and only if P/R is Galois with group G together with ii) shows that this homomorphism is the identity on the coboundaries.• It is possible to extend this to an isomorphism  FORMULA  where R is a field and P/R is an infinite Galois extension. There are further ideas involved, such as the subject of Lie algebra homology of which a general exposition is given in [GL76]. This is idea is extended to Kac-Moody algebras in [K90], and even further in [J05, J96] to Borcherds or generalized Kac-Moody algebras. The results can be used to find a character formula for the Borcherds algebras. Another interesting idea is that of orbifold cohomology discussed in [EO00]. We can't go into any detail since this section is already a major digression. It will suffice to say that a type of cohomology implies some interesting properties of a Cherednik algebra. My interest in these algebras derives from interest in triple groups which result after making some changes to the generators of a Coxeter group. <heading>1.2.4 De Rham Cohomology</heading>We define the de Rham complex of U to be the commutative, differential, graded algebra  FORMULA  for an anti-commutative algebra  FORMULA  with a differential  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Theorem 24. The composition  FORMULA is zero for all non-negative k. Proof: We have  FORMULA . We use the fact that  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  with proof in [MJ97].  FORMULA = FORMULA = FORMULA = FORMULA . •(1.4) Theorem 25. The operator d : Ωk(U) - ►Ωk+1(U) satisfying <list> FORMULA ; FORMULA ; FORMULA </list>is unique. Proof: We have defined  FORMULA  with these properties. Let e satisfy the above properties. Then we must show that  FORMULA . Now it is simple that  FORMULA  from property 1 and  FORMULA  implies that  FORMULA . We see from property 3 that  FORMULA  and that  FORMULA  So  FORMULA . • The kth d e Rh am cohomology group is  FORMULA . The de Rham cohomology group coincides with other cohomology groups so we will use the usual notation for a cohomology group. The kth de Rham cohomology group of the smooth n-manifold X is the kth cohomology vector space of  FORMULA . The exterior product of forms extends to give a product  FORMULA . A category C category consists both a collection of objects and, for each pair of objects, a collection of morphisms from one object to another. In most categories over sets, an object is given as some mathematical structure such as a group, open set, vector space or chain complex. A morphism is simply a map between two objects in C. It is required that the morphisms then satisfy some conditions such as the identity map between an object and itself is always a morphism, and the composition of two morphisms is always a morphism too. The morphisms are usually required to preserve the mathematical structure of the objects. If the objects are groups, the morphisms should all be group homomorphisms. For vector spaces, linear maps would be the morphisms of choice, for manifolds, one would choose smooth maps and, similarly, chain maps for chain complexes. We say that de Rham cohomology is functorial, Theorem 26. A smooth map  FORMULA  induces a linear map  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . Sketch of Proof Let  FORMULA  have  FORMULA , a cycle from  FORMULA  with cohomology class  FORMULA  its corresponding cohomology class in  FORMULA  and define  FORMULA . Considering the chain complexes and chain maps we have  FORMULA  so that  FORMULA  is a cycle.  FORMULA  is independent of the choice of cycle so if [x] = [y] then  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  and so  FORMULA  and  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  define the same cohomology class [H0 2]. • A contravariant functor  FORMULA  maps every object in C to an object in  FORMULA , and every morphism in C to an object in  FORMULA  given by  FORMULA  for a morphism  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  and  FORMULA .  FORMULA  is a contravariant functor. We define  FORMULA  to be the linear map given by  FORMULA  for the exact sequence of chain complexes  FORMULA . Theorem 27. Let  FORMULA be an exact sequence of chain complexes. Then  FORMULA  is exact. Sketch of Proof: Follow the proof of Theorem 20. • Theorem 28. If C and C are chain complexes then  FORMULA . Proof: The proof follows from the observations that  FORMULA  and that  FORMULA  [S02].• Theorem 29. (Mayer-Vietoris) Let U1 and U 2 be open sets in  FORMULA with  FORMULA . Then there exists an exact sequence  FORMULA . The proof depends on the following lemma [MJ97]. Lemma 1. Let U1 and U 2 be open sets in  FORMULA with  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  be the inclusions corresponding to the sets. There is an exact sequence:  FORMULA where  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Proof of Theorem: We see that we have chain maps  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  so we can apply the previous lemma. Then 27 and 28 give  FORMULA  [H02]. • The support of f, a function  FORMULA , is the set  FORMULA . Define an integral  FORMULA  on the vector space of n-forms with compact support. <heading>1.2.5 Differential Forms, Generalizing the De Rham Complex and Integration on Manifolds</heading>The treatment of differential forms on manifolds is, for the most part, as discussed above. We say that  FORMULA  a family of alternating k-forms is smooth on  FORMULA  if  FORMULA  is a smooth function for any local parametrization. The set of such ω is denoted  FORMULA . The nth de Rham cohomology of X,  FORMULA , is the nth cohomology vector space of  FORMULA . An orientation form on the k-manifold X is an  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . An orientation of X is the equivalence class of orientation forms. The standard orientation representing  FORMULA  is the orientation form  FORMULA . A basis of  FORMULA  is positively or negatively oriented depending on whether  FORMULA  is positive or negative for ω the orientation form of X [M05]. We can define an integral on  FORMULA  the space of differential n-forms with compact support just as we can integrate 1-forms of 1-manifolds. Take X which is diffeomorphic to a region  FORMULA  which has a smooth boundary. Let  FORMULA  be an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism. Define the integral  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is the standard basis for  FORMULA . Theorem 30. If  FORMULA  is also an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism then we have  FORMULA . Proof: We have  FORMULA  a diffeomorphism and  FORMULA  for h(x) = y by the chain rule. We write  FORMULA , and we can show that  FORMULA  where  FORMULA . We also have that det A is the Jacobi determinant of h. Since the dif-feomorphisms are orientation preserving, we have the equality  FORMULA  [MJ97].• We can restate this as a change of variables in  FORMULA  - saying that for two regions U, V in  FORMULA  and an orientation-preserving differomorphism  FORMULA  we have  FORMULA  for any n-form ω. Similarly,  FORMULA  for any n-form ω if φ reverses the orientation. This comes from the restating  FORMULA  [GP74] since the form is equal to some smooth function on U times a determinant by Theorem 30. Then  FORMULA  by a theorem we will give shortly. Then we restate the previous theorem after redefining  FORMULA . Theorem 31. For 1-forms  FORMULA . This is obvious for k = 2. Then the lemma follows by induction on k applied to the definition of the exterior product. The other important theorem in this discussion is, of course, Stokes' theorem which is stated in this case as: Theorem 32. Let  FORMULA  be a compact oriented k-manifold with boundary. Then  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . A proof can be found in [MJ97]. <heading>1.3 Poincare Duality, the Complex Projective Space and Vector Bundles</heading><heading>1.3.1 Homology, Cohomology and Duality</heading>Let X be a compact, oriented smooth n-manifold. Poincare duality is the statement that  FORMULA  for integer k. Let  FORMULA  denote the de Rham cohomology group with compact support. It is given in [M052] that: Theorem 33.  FORMULA only if k = n and  FORMULA  i n all other cases. We have a theorem that follows from Mayer-Vietoris which is needed to prove the duality theorem. Theorem 34. There is an exact sequence  FORMULA  Proof: Let X be a smooth manifold with open subsets  FORMULA . We define the direct image hom o-morphism  FORMULA  extended from  FORMULA , the chain map induced from the inclusion  FORMULA . We can define another inclusion to give a covariant functor on the category of open sets and inclusions. Let U1 and U 2 be open sets in  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  be the inclusions corresponding to the sets. There is an exact sequence:  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Apply Mayer-Vietoris to this exact sequence.[H02] • Theorem 35. For  FORMULA , pairwise disjoint open subsets with union U of the smooth manifold X, we have  FORMULA  given by  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  given by  FORMULA  The idea here is to use the fact that there are such isomorphisms for chain complexes, and to extend that. The proof of Poincare duality follows after a bit more work. We define a linear map  FORMULA  from the bilinear map  FORMULA  defined by  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is the vector space dual of  FORMULA . This follows from a composition with integration of the bilinear map  FORMULA . A contravariant functor sending A to its vector space dual A* is exact. So we can dualize the sequence of Theorem 34 and by the previous theorem we have an isomorphism  FORMULA . For an oriented n-manifold the exterior product defines  FORMULA  inducing  FORMULA . Theorem 36. The diagram  FORMULA commutes for open sets  FORMULA . Proof: Let  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  be cohomology classes. Then  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  for i'the vector space dual of i*. Then since  FORMULA  we can integrate over V instead of U. We see that the forms are the same on V. So the diagram commutes [S99]. • We can extend this to the theorem below, which is proved by the same methods. Theorem 37. For open sets of X, U1 and U2 with union U, we have the commutative diagram  FORMULA . Corollary 1. For open subsets of X we have their union satisfying Poincare duality if  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  satisfy that condition. Similarly for pairwise disjoint open sets. Lastly, U satisfies duality if it is diffeomorphic to  FORMULA . Then we give a theorem proved in [MJ97] that will let us proceed. Theorem 38. Let U be a collection of open subsets of the n-manifold X with open cover V. We have  FORMULA , Any open subset that is a subset of a set in the open cover and is diffeomorphic to  FORMULA  is in U, the union of two open subsets is in U is the open subsets and their intersection are in U and a similar condition for pairwise disjoint open subsets. This lets us prove duality. Theorem 39. (Poincare Duality) For an oriented n-manifold we see that  FORMULA  is an isomorphism for all k. Proof: Let U be the open subsets of X with  FORMULA  being isomorphisms. Let V be the trivial cover X. Then Corollary 1 shows that we have satisfied the conditions of Theorem 38 [H02, MJ97, M05]. • Another way of expressing this is  FORMULA . <heading>Chapter 2 Connections to Stiefel-Whitney Classes</heading><heading>2.1 Connections, Curvature and Characteristic Classes</heading><heading>2.1.1 Complex Projective Space and Fiber Bundles</heading> FORMULA  denotes the set of one-dimensional subspaces of  FORMULA . It is the n-dimensional complex projective space. For  FORMULA  we let  FORMULA  spanned by z be denoted by  FORMULA . Theorem 40. The cohomology of  FORMULA  is  FORMULA for  FORMULA  or  FORMULA otherwise. We can extend the embedding  FORMULA  to an embedding of  FORMULA  into  FORMULA . Assume the statement for C and n > 2 since the cohomologies  FORMULA  by Proposition 13.11 [?] which states that there is a certain long exact sequence. Then  FORMULA  is homeomorphic with  FORMULA  by a certain homeomorphism defined in [MJ97] . The exact sequence has the form  FORMULA  Then by Theorem 33 we have  FORMULA  only when k = 2n when it is R. The result follows. A fiber bundle is three topological spaces T, the total space, B, the base space, and F, the fiber space together with a continuous map  FORMULA  such that each  FORMULA  has an open neighbourhood U b and a homeomorphism  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . The fiber over x is the pre-image of  FORMULA , denoted  FORMULA . If T, B, F are smooth manifolds then we have a smooth fiber bundle [MJ97, M052, S99]. A vector bundle is a quadruple  FORMULA  with the fiber space F and  FORMULA  are vector spaces for all x and we can choose the local homeomorphism h so that  FORMULA  is a linear isomorphism. One bundle which will be very useful is the tangent bundle. Take a smooth n-manifold and  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . The fiber over  FORMULA  is the tangent space  FORMULA . A map (f,g) between fiber bundles  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  is a pair of continuous maps  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . A homomorphism between vector bundles is a fiber bundle map such that  FORMULA  is linear for all  FORMULA . Vector bundles over the same base space are isomorphic if there exist homomorphisms  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . A vector bundle that is isomorphic to a product bundle  FORMULA  is called trivial. Theorem 41. A continuous map  FORMULA  of vector bundles over B is an isomorphism if it maps the fiber  FORMULA  injectively onto  FORMULA  . The direct sum  FORMULA  of two vector bundles over the base space  FORMULA  is the vector bundle  FORMULA  with total space  FORMULA  and a projection  FORMULA . An inner product on a vector bundle ν is a map  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  is an inner product on each fiber  FORMULA . Theorem 42. Every vector bundle over a compact B has an inner product. A section in a fiber bundle is a smooth map  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . Theorem 43. Every vector bundle ν over a compact base space B has a complement. <heading>2.1.2 Operators on Bundles</heading>We consider the tensor product and the exterior product; first applied to vector spaces and then investigating the application to vector bundles. We assume familiarity with the definition of modules and free algebras. The tensor product  FORMULA  of two R-modules is the quotient  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is the free R-module with basis  FORMULA  for R a commutative ring with unity,  FORMULA . The canonical projection  FORMULA  given by  FORMULA  is R-bilinear when restricted to  FORMULA  by the generators of the submodule in the quotient module. Any R-bilinear map can be expressed as the composition of the restricted canonical projection and an unique R-linear map. In this case, we say the tensor product is universal. To prove this, we have the following: Theorem 44. For an R-bilinear map  FORMULA , with U, V, W being R-modules, there exists an unique R-linear map  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . This has the immediate consequence that the tensor product is a functor. Proof: f extends naturally to an R-linear map  FORMULA . f is R-bilinear so the image of  FORMULA ,  FORMULA , is 0 under f'. Then f' induces the map g from  FORMULA  to W. We see then that  FORMULA  is R-linear. g is uniquely determined by f since  FORMULA  is generated by the image of  FORMULA  under  FORMULA . • We define a new entity by considering the R-submodule  FORMULA  generated by  FORMULA . The exterior kth-power is the quotient module  FORMULA . We define a canonical projection  FORMULA  by  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  for some permutation τ by Theorem 14 and Theorem 16. Then the composition  FORMULA  is an alternating map where λ is extended to k-variable tensor products. There is then an obvious extension of Theorem 44 to accompany the new definition. From Theorem 44 extended to k-variable tensor products: Theorem 45. There is an unique R-linear map  FORMULA  for any R-alternating map  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . In the case R = K where we consider finite-dimensional vector spaces the exterior ppwers are dual to  FORMULA  the alternating powers introduced earlier. Letting  FORMULA , the exterior product gives an alternating map  FORMULA . By Theorem 45 we have an unique linear map  FORMULA . For this map we have the following, proved in [MJ97]: Theorem 46. We have: i) φis an isomorphism; ii)  FORMULA  is a basis for  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  a basis of V; ii i) There is an isomorphism  FORMULA . The balanced product, denoted  FORMULA  is the cokernel of the R-linear homomorphism  FORMULA  given by  FORMULA . The cokernel of a homomorphism of modules  FORMULA  is the quotient module  FORMULA . We define  FORMULA  by  FORMULA  which becomes a B-module when B is commutative which is obviously isomorphic to the R-module  FORMULA  <heading>2.1.3 Connections and Curvature Forms</heading>The next section involves connections, although some of the more interesting discussion is omitted since our goal in this section is to develop the idea of characteristic classes. We will later see how Yang-Mills theory, the theory of connections, makes frequent appearances in our work. A connection on ν is a linear map  FORMULA  satisfying  FORMULA  for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and exterior differential d, where  FORMULA  is the tensor product. We require  FORMULA  to be C-linear when ν is a complex vector bundle with  FORMULA  a complex vector space. We can tidy this up to a connection being a linear operator  FORMULA  satisfying the Leibiniz rule by letting  FORMULA . The trick here is to extend the connection to an operator  FORMULA  satisfying similar conditions to the derivation on differential forms that we discussed above. We define a  FORMULA -bilinear product  FORMULA  by  FORMULA  where  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Theorem 47. The  FORMULA -bilinear product A satisfies the following: <list> FORMULA . FORMULA ;for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA .</list>This follows simply from the associativity of the exterior product. Then we have to following for [MJ97]: Theorem 48. There is an unique linear operator  FORMULA  satisfying that  FORMULA when i = 0 and  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and  FORMULA .  FORMULA  gives a sequence of vector spaces  FORMULA . Amazingly, this is not a complex generally, although it is the de Rham complex when  FORMULA  and ν is the trivial line bundle. We do have  FORMULA  which can be seen to be  FORMULA -linear since  FORMULA . We also have that  FORMULA  by a theorem we omitted earlier, [M74]. The 2-form  FORMULA  is called the curvature form of the pair  FORMULA . The connection  FORMULA  is called flat if  FORMULA . We now define the  FORMULA -bilinear product  FORMULA  mapping a pair  FORMULA  into  FORMULA . Theorem 49. There is a map  FORMULA  from t to FORMULA . Proof: By Theorem 48 we have  FORMULA . • So the sequence mentioned above is a chain complex when  FORMULA  is flat. <heading>2.2 Characteristic Classes</heading><heading>2.2.1 Real and Complex Vector Bundles: The Many Characteristic Classes</heading>We are, for the most part, interested in the Stiefel-Whitney class, so we only briefly visit the following ideas as an introduction to characteristic classes. Let ν be a complex vector bundle. The kth Chern character class of the pair  FORMULA  is the cohomology class  FORMULA , the cohomology of the complexified de Rham complex. The factor that normalizes the cohomology class  FORMULA  is there so that the Chern character class is in fact a real cohomology class in  FORMULA , a fact we discuss further later. The kth Pontryagin character class  FORMULA  of the pair  FORMULA  is given by  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  which in turn induces a complex connection  FORMULA . We need to revisit the discussion of connections to understand the definitions above. We see that if  FORMULA  is a section that vanishes on an open subset  FORMULA  then so does  FORMULA  so  FORMULA  is a local operator. In particular, this induces a connection on  FORMULA , the restriction of the vector bundle to the open subset  FORMULA . The connection form with respect to the basis  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  is denoted by A where  FORMULA  is a kxk matrix of 1-forms and  FORMULA  since elements of  FORMULA  has the unique expression  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . Then we calculate  FORMULA  from  FORMULA  (2.1) so  FORMULA . For the connection  FORMULA  on  FORMULA  we have  FORMULA  defined by  FORMULA  and from this definition we have: Theorem 50. (Bianchi's identity) We have  FORMULA . Proof:  FORMULA  (2.2) The trace homomorphism  FORMULA  induces [MJ97]  FORMULA .and we can prove that  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . Take  FORMULA  to be a homogeneous invariant  FORMULA  polynomial with variables in a n x n matrix A. The exterior product is commutative on even-dimensional differential forms so we can replace  FORMULA  with differential 2-forms  FORMULA . Then we can define  FORMULA . As earlier, there is a matrix B of 2-forms of  FORMULA . We can from this define a global 2-form, one that is independent of basis, denoted  FORMULA . If we to let  FORMULA  to get a 2k-form  FORMULA  then it would be possible to prove that the connection involved was a closed form and that the cohomology class  FORMULA  is independent of the connection. Then the kth Chern class is  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is the coefficient of  FORMULA  in  FORMULA . Then for  FORMULA  we have the kth Chern character class being  FORMULA . It's simple to see equivalence with the earlier definition. With the updated definitions, say ν is a real vector bundle. Then  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . We let ν be a smooth real 2k-dimensional vector bundle over a manifold X with and inner product  FORMULA . This induces a pairing with  FORMULA  defined  FORMULA  where  FORMULA . A connection  FORMULA  on the pair  FORMULA  is said to be orthogonal if  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA  be the curvature form of a metric connection  FORMULA . We treat this form as we did in the previous section and finally apply the Pfaffian polynomial. We define the Euler class of the oriented 2k-dimensional vector bundle ν as  FORMULA . For a complex k-dimensional complex vector bundle we can prove that the Euler class is equal to the kth Chern class. Let ν be a vector bundle and take S(ν) to be the vector space of sections on the bundle ν. We have the zero section in S(ν) assigning the origin in the fiber  FORMULA  to  FORMULA . The zero section embeds B into T with  FORMULA  as a retraction map and then  FORMULA  is an isomorphism. Let  FORMULA  denote the nonzero vectors of T. This next theorem is proved in [M74]. Theorem 51. (Thom Isomorphism Theorem) There is an unique cohomology class  FORMULA  such that for each fiber F, the image of [c] under the restriction  FORMULA  is nonzero. Furthermore,  FORMULA defines an isomorphism  FORMULA . The composition of the isomorphism  FORMULA  and the one defined in Theorem 51 is known as the Thom isomorphism. Then the ith Stiefel-Whitney class  FORMULA  is given by the composition  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is a Steenrod square, an additive operation  FORMULA  satisfying <list>S 0 is the identity; FORMULA  when  FORMULA ;If  FORMULA  then  FORMULA ; FORMULA ;</list><heading>Chapter 3 Topology of Four-manifolds</heading>From this point on we restrict our attention to 4-manifolds and their topology. This type of work is the perfect setting to describe the cohomology and related issues that were in-troduced above. In this section we will direct our attention to compact, simply connected, differentiable 4-manifolds and will give a proof of a result involving simply connected, com-plex surfaces. We will be forced to introduce some new methods as well, but will try to approach the theorem without any major headaches. Many of these new ideas are quite complicated so we content ourselves with a more general explanation of ideas. <heading>3.1 Algebraic Geometry and Topology</heading><heading>3.1.1 Basics and Other Definitions</heading>Take a closed, orientable four-manifold, X. By Poincare duality we have  FORMULA . When X is simply connected we have  FORMULA  so that any homological information exists only in  FORMULA . By the universal coefficient theorem [INS] we have  FORMULA  being a free abelian groups, giving the fact that  FORMULA  is a free abelian group. We now need to realize the homology and cohomology classes of a four-manifold X. More than this, we will find later that many of the ways of doing this will prove useful at some point so we need to be able to work our way between them. The first way is by the complex vector bundle of rank 1 - complex line bundle - which is determined up to isomorphism by  FORMULA  its Chern class in  FORMULA  so we have a bijection from the isomorphism classes of line bundles to  FORMULA . We can also use smoothly embedded, two-dimesional, oriented surfaces in X. A surface of this type carries a fundamental homology class in  FORMULA  so that we can choose a general smooth section of a line bundle whose zero set us a surface which represents the homology class that is dual to  FORMULA . Then, last of all, we have de Rham cohomology - a representation of real cohomology classes by differential forms. Let X be a compact, oriented, simply connected four-manifold. The Poincare duality isomorphism is equivalent to a bilinear form  FORMULA  known as the intersection form of the manifold X. It is a symmetric form which induces an isomorphism between the groups  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . We call the latter property unimodular. For two oriented surfaces  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  in X, a four-manifold, we assign the notation  FORMULA  to each point in their intersection according to the orientations in the isomorphism of the tangent bundles  FORMULA  with intersection number given by the total number of points counted by sign. We can, of course, move this over to homology to give the form F. Then the cup product is  FORMULA . In terms of de Rham cohomology we are given the intersection number by the integral  FORMULA  for some closed 2-forms  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  representing the classes that are dual to the oriented surfaces  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  in X. We know that the Betti number of the manifold X is given by  FORMULA . For the second Betti number  FORMULA  we write  FORMULA  where the  FORMULA  are the dimensions of the maximal positive, respectively negative, subspaces for the intersection form on H 2(X; R). The signature of an oriented four-manifold is then defined to be  FORMULA . The intersection form on the real vector space  FORMULA  is classified up to equivalence by  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . An n-dimensional complex manifold is a 2n-dimensional smooth manifold with an open cover U1 and maps  FORMULA  so that  FORMULA  are complex differentiable on  FORMULA . A hermitian metric on X, an n-dimensional complex manifold, is a positive definite hermitian inner product, an inner product where the first term is linear and the second is complex linear, at each point  FORMULA  which varies smoothly over X. A hermitian metric where  FORMULA . is called a Kahler metric. In this case,  FORMULA  is called a Kahler form and a complex manifold that is equipped with such a metric is know as a Kahler manifold. Hodge theory involves a study of the algebraic topology of a smooth manifold X of the partial differential equation theory of generalised Laplacian operators associated to a Riemannian metric on X. In other words, Hodge theory gives representatives for cohomology classes on X, a compact Riemannian manifold. The theory was developed by W. V. D. Hodge in the thirties - as an extension of de Rham cohomology - and it has major applications in the discussion of Riemannian manifolds, Kahler manifolds and algebraic geometry of complex projective varieties. The adjoint operator is defined  FORMULA . The Hodge theorem gives  FORMULA  for each unique representative a of a real cohomology class. Given a Riemannian metric we have the decomposition  FORMULA  into self-dual and anti self-dual harmonic 2-forms. For an oriented four-manifold the characteristic classes to hand are the familiar Euler and Pontryagin classes along with the Stiefel-Whitney classes denoted by  FORMULA . The second Stiefel-Whitney class w2 is from the mod2 reduction of the intersection formula  FORMULA  for all  FORMULA  [D903]. We finish with a few useful definitions. Given two disjoint connected n-manifolds X and Y, then a connected n-manifold  FORMULA  called the connected sum can be constructed by deleting the interiors of closed n-balls  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  and identifying the boundary spheres which result. Define a complex surface as a complex manifold of dimension 2 - which is a smooth 4-manifold X. <heading>3.1.2 Beginnings of Yang-Mills Theory: Anti-Self-Dual Connec-tions Over Four-Manifolds</heading>Suppose that X is an oriented Riemann four-manifold. From Hodge theory we have the decomposition of 2-forms on X into dual and anti self-dual parts  FORMULA . This extends to the curvature form  FORMULA  on  FORMULA  over X. Write  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . A conection is anti self-dual if  FORMULA . On the space  FORMULA  the ASD equation  FORMULA  is the system of PDEs:  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA , for  FORMULA . ASD connections are solutions of the Yang-Mills equations a special case of the Euler-Lagrange equations for the Yang-Mills functional, the square of the L 2-norm of the curvature form  FORMULA . Take a twice differentiable function from  FORMULA  to  FORMULA and a twice differentiable function from  FORMULA  to  FORMULA . An integral is defined on the first function which we allow to vary while fixing the second. The first function must satisfy a certain differential equation when we try to find the Lagrangian. Then this equation is known as the Euler-Lagrange differential equation or the Euler-Lagrange condition. Take l a Hermitian line bundle over some manifold X. The curvature form  FORMULA  for the connection  FORMULA  on l is known to be an imaginary 2-form  FORMULA  so that  FORMULA  is a real 2-form that is closed by Bianchi's identity. Take a new connection  FORMULA  which gives  FORMULA  so  FORMULA  so it is dependent only on the choice of l. This is the Chern class c 1(l). Let ν be a vector bundle and we know  FORMULA . The 4-form  FORMULA  depends only on ν. These forms represent a characteristic class of ν;  FORMULA  for a complex vector bundle v. The Pontryagin class discussed earlier is the standard four-dimensional class for a real orthogonal bundle given  FORMULA . This bundle also has a Stiefel-Whitney class, satisfying  FORMULA . <heading>3.1.3 Yang-Mills Moduli Spaces</heading>First we define the gauge group  FORMULA  of the bundle ν as the set of automorphisms  FORMULA  which '[respects] the structure on the fibres and [covers] the identity map on [the smooth manifold] X' [D903]. The gauge group acts  FORMULA  on the set of connections. The moduli space  FORMULA  on a bundle ν, over a compact, oriented Riemannian four-manifold X, is defined to be the set of gauge equivalence classes of ASD connections on ν. The moduli space C has an induced topology, induced by the topology in the space of connections. The space  FORMULA  is a Sobolev space and is defined to be the completion of the space of smooth functions on  FORMULA  that is compactly supported on the norm  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  the tensor of the ith derivatives of f. We define  FORMULA  for a vector bundle ν over X a compact manifold [A82, D903, 1]. Then we have: Theorem 52. (Sobolev embedding theorem) If  FORMULA  then there is a bounded inclusion from  FORMULA into the Banach space  FORMULA  when  FORMULA . So for a four-manifold X the Sobolev embedding theorem says that  FORMULA  is a space of continuous functions when  FORMULA . The set of gauge equivalence classes is defined to be the quotient space  FORMULA  where S is the space of  FORMULA  connections on ν and Q is the group of  FORMULA  gauge transformations and we denote the equivalence class of a connection  FORMULA  by  FORMULA .  FORMULA  the L2 metric on S and this is preserved by Q so we have  FORMULA  We can show that this is a metric in quite a simple way. The only condition for metrics that isn't trivial is to show that  FORMULA  implies  FORMULA . We suppose that  FORMULA  and we let  FORMULA  be a sequence in S with all  FORMULA  gauge equivalent to  FORMULA  and the sequence converging in  FORMULA  to  FORMULA  so the proof depends on showing that  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  are gauge equivalent. If  FORMULA  then we can prove  FORMULA . So we just show that g lies in the subset of unitary sections of  FORMULA . On a Riemannian manifold X, we can move tangent vectors along a path by parallel transport, preserving vector addition and scalar multiplication. A closed loop at a base point x, gives rise to a invertible linear map of Tx(X), the tangent vectors at x. We can compose these closed loops and we invert them by going backwards. The set of linear transformations resulting from parallel transport along closed loops is called the holonomy group. A connection  FORMULA  on ν is reducible if the holonomy maps of all loops based at each  FORMULA  lie in some proper subgroup of the automorphism group  FORMULA . If we have a connected base X then it is possible to find a holonomy group  FORMULA . We define  FORMULA  of  FORMULA  in the gauge  FORMULA  as  FORMULA . We can show that  FORMULA  the centralizer of  FORMULA . Further, for small  FORMULA , we can show that the projection  FORMULA  induces a homomophism from  FORMULA  to a a neighbourhood of  FORMULA  and for  FORMULA , the isotropy group of  FORMULA  is isomorphic to the isotropy group of  FORMULA . This is for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is the bundle of Lie algebras associated to the adjoint operator  FORMULA . Then we have to find the solutions of the ASD equation  FORMULA  to complete the construction of the moduli space. Consider the Sobolev space  FORMULA  - denote by  FORMULA  the orbit space. For  FORMULA  and a bundle ν 'we have a moduli space  FORMULA  composed of  FORMULA  ASD connections modulo  FORMULA  gauge transformations' [D903]. Theorem 53. The inclusion  FORMULA  is a homeomorhism. This theorem means that we can ditch the cumbersome Sobolev-type notation. We let  FORMULA  be an ASD connection and we define  FORMULA  given by  FORMULA  We take the zero set  FORMULA  and from our earlier work we see that a homeomorphism is induced from  FORMULA  to the neighbourhood of  FORMULA  in  FORMULA . <heading>3.2 Main Theorem</heading>We take a leap here, defining and stating what we need. These results follow from what we have discussed above but the ideas involved are quite complicated so we we will avoid them, Although the work is complex, the ideas are, as with most work in this area, geometrically reasonable so that we can get some sense of what is happening. What we want to do is to be able to distinguish between four-manifolds that have the same invariants. So, first we define some new invariants using moduli spaces. To illustrate, we take the simple case of a zero-dimensional moduli space. So the invariant is an integer since it is a class in zero-dimensional homology. Take a simply-connected four-manifold with  FORMULA  with ν an SO(3) bundle with  FORMULA  nonzero and  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . We can see that for this to be true,  FORMULA  must be odd so that  FORMULA . We define the invariant to be  FORMULA  for the sign  FORMULA  at a point  FORMULA  depending on the orientation of the determinant line bundle  FORMULA  and the moduli space  FORMULA  for some generic metric g. We can prove that q is independent of the choice of generic metric g. We can apply this idea more generally. That is, we can define invariants of a four-manifold X by a process similar to above - taking the moduli space to contain some homology class that is indepdenent of the choice of generic metric. Theorem 54. Let X be a simply connected four-manifold with  FORMULA  odd, and suppose that  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . Then the polynomial invariants are identically zero. We now complete our investigation. Corollary 2. For any simply-connected, complex surface S with  FORMULA there is a smooth four-manifold X(S) which is homotopy equivalent to but not diffeomorphic to S, nor to any complex surface. This theorem follows from: Corollary 3. No simply connected, complex, algebraic surface S can be written as a smooth connected sum  FORMULA with  FORMULA  and  FORMULA positive. This theorem is as follows from the next theorem and the results regarding polynomial invariants. Theorem 55. We have  FORMULA for large k if S is a compact, simply connected, complex surface with  FORMULA . This theorem is implied by the following central result that we have aimed to discuss. We saw earlier that the four-manifold has a standard orientation with  FORMULA . The embedding of S in projective space defines h, a hyperplane class in  FORMULA . Theorem 56. For any simply connected, complex algebraic surface S, with  FORMULA and any hyperplane class h in  FORMULA  there is a  FORMULA  such that for  FORMULA  and any Stiefel-Whitney class  FORMULA  which is the reduction of a (1,1) class  FORMULA , we have  FORMULA . A detailed proof is included in Section 10.1.4 of [D903]. We will not attempt to give a proof but will discuss the more comprehensible ideas behind it. We let S be a complex, algebraic surface. We put a Kahler metric on S, that is compatible with a certain projective embedding [D903]. The de Rham cohomology of the metric 2-form  FORMULA  is dual (Poincare) to the hyperplane section class  FORMULA . We define  FORMULA , [X]) where  FORMULA  is a specific cohomology class and for X the compact, regular moduli space of ASD connections defined relative to the Kahler metric. We know that we can represent  FORMULA  by the 2-form  FORMULA  since the metric form is self dual. By de Rham cohomology,  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  as required since X must be a complex manifold and  FORMULA  the 2-form of the natural Kahler metric on X.  FORMULA , the Riemannian volume element on X [MJ97], so  FORMULA .
