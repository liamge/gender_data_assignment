<heading>1.0 Magnetising Curve & Running Light Equivalent Circuit Parameters:</heading><heading>1.1 Measured Data:</heading><table/><heading>1.2 Calculation of Equivalent Circuit Parameters:</heading><figure/>The running light test enabled the calculation of the total volt-amp reaction (Q total), the magnetising reactance (X m) and core loss resistance (R c).  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  <table/><figure/>The lower section of the graph (0.75 - 1.5A) shows a linear relationship between current and voltage. At 200V (the saturation point) the current-voltage relationships starts to level off. For an 'x' increase in current above the saturation point, not as big a voltage increase occurs as below the saturation point. The locked rotor test enabled the calculation of R 1 and R 2' (the stator coil and rotor coil resistances respectively) and the leakage reactances (X 1 + X 2').  FORMULA  Eq. 7 where R ph-ph was measured directly as 7.6Î©  FORMULA  Eq. 8 where  FORMULA  Eq. 9 <table/><heading>1.3 Graphs from MatLAb:</heading>See Appendix 1 for graphs of generator efficiency against machine speed, power against machine speed and line current against machine speed. The generator efficiency started at about 15% just above 1500rpm then shot up to its maximum of 75% at about 1590rpm. After this point it decreased steadily to just over 20% at 2250rpm. <heading>2.0 Load Test (Grid connection):</heading><heading>2.1 Measured Data:</heading><table/><figure/><figure/>Graph 2 shows that the induction machine started to act as a generator and produce power at 1507rpm. (A negative power indicates that power was being generated.) This was slightly above the synchronous speed. The synchronous speed is the speed at which the rotor speed exactly matches the stator speed (magnetic field). As no flux is being cut no current is induced, and hence no power. Graph 3 shows that above the synchronous speed (approx 1500rpm) the current induced increased linearly with machine speed. Nb. The reason for the 'kick backs' at the beginning of both graphs is because these readings where taken when there was no water pressure so they can be ignored. <heading>2.2 Efficiencies:</heading>The table below shows the efficiency of the induction machine whilst acting as a generator. This was achieved from the interpretation of Graph 1 in Appendix 1. <table/>The measured pressure had to be corrected by subtracting 30% from it. This represented the pressure loss in the pipes. This corrected pressure was then used to attain the input power from the jet to the turbine by using graph A.5 from the lab script. At this stage it was possible to calculate the overall efficiency and turbine efficiency by using equations 10 & 11. The calculated data is shown in the table and graph 4 below.  FORMULA  Eq. 10  FORMULA  Eq. 11 <table/><figure/>The turbine efficiency peaked at 1537rpm, this was due to the blade geometry. Above 1537rpm the rate at which torque was produced by the blades started to reduce hence the reduction in efficiency. The generator efficiency rose steadily from 45% to just above 70% over the range of tested speeds. However the graph shows that it was beginning to level off at the higher speeds, so if even higher speeds had been tested the optimum efficiency may have been observed. The product of the turbine and generator efficiencies gave the overall efficiency. Therefore as expected it rose from just above 30% at a rate just lower than the generator and then levelled of at a rate significantly faster than the generator because of the dropping off of the turbine efficiency at the higher speeds. The maximum overall efficiency was 48% at the highest tested speed. <heading>3.0 Three-Phase Stand Alone Operation:</heading><heading>3.1 Capacitor Sizing and Frequency & Synchronous Speed:</heading>As induction machines have no internal magnetic excitation a capacitor is needed to provide this excitation. The capacitor generates the required volt-amp reaction for the magnetising reactances. Equation 12 demonstrates the required size of capacitor to bring up the voltage to 220V at 50Hz.  FORMULA  Eq. 12 During the stand-alone operation of the induction machine it was not required to run at the grid frequency of 50Hz. Equation 13 was used to calculate the frequency at which the stand-alone operation ran at.  FORMULA  Eq. 13 This frequency was then used to calculate the synchronous speed of the induction machine running at 62Hz.  FORMULA  Eq. 14 With the synchronous speed of the machine being 1860rpm instead of 1500rpm the generator would have been operating at a higher efficiency (as discussed in section 2.2). Graphs 2 & 3 in Appendix 1 have the power and current points from this stand-alone operation plotted on them. Notice how none of the points sit on the curves. This is because the curves are from grid connected operation. This highlights the unstable operation of a stand-alone system. <heading>3.2 Efficiency:</heading>The table below shows the measured and calculated data from the stand-alone test. <table/>Graph 5 overleaf shows the overall efficiency against the load setting. The efficiency rose from zero at zero load to a maximum of 56% at maximum load setting of 3. This is as expected because as the load on the induction machine increased the current induced and hence power produced increased. <figure/><heading>4.0 Single-Phase Ballast Operation:</heading>As seen above stand-alone operation is quite unstable. One way to stablise the operation is to use a ballast controller. With varying load, instead of letting the generator respond to the load, the ballast controller responds. The generator operates at constant output (current, voltage, power), the load draws what it requires and the excess power is 'dumped'. This is all managed by the ballast controller. The table below shows how the ballast controller reacted under varying load (set of lights). <table/>Graph 6 overleaf shows the efficiency of the system as a function of the load. It is perfectly linear as the load drew what ever power it needed and the ballast controller reacted accordingly. Quite obviously at zero load the efficiency was zero as all the power was being dumped into a resistor bank. As the load increased the efficiency increased in hand. So if a load of 350W was activated the efficiency of the system would be 100%. <figure/>The ballast control system regulated the voltage very effectively as it was held at 220V regardless of the load. Whereas during the stand-alone operation in section 3 the voltage 'jumped' around as load varied. It took some time for the voltage to stabilise upon load adjustment. <heading>5.0 Conclusions:</heading>With a ballast control system, an induction machine micro-hydro scheme would be very effective as a stand alone single-phase system. This is because of the ease of voltage regulation. An induction machine micro-hydro scheme would also be effective when ran as a three-phase grid connected system. When running as a stand-alone single-phase ballast controlled system it would be valuable to use the excess power instead of just dumping it. There are a number of possible uses for this excess power, for example using the energy from a resistor bank to heat water for district heating or storage in a heat sink. In the future, when and if the hydrogen economy takes off, the excess power could be used to generate hydrogen.
