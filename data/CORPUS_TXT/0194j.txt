<heading>Referral information Source of referral and a summary of key information</heading>A 72 year old man admitted on  for an elective right Charnley® total hip replacement, a revision of initial garden hip screw fixation. <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background. The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading><heading>Presenting complaint:</heading>Subcapital fracture of neck of femur, right hip on . <heading>History of presenting complaint:</heading>Mr  fell onto his right side in the street on the evening of the  and although there wasn't any initial pain, he knew something was wrong, as he was unable to get up and couldn't move his leg. He underwent repair of his hip with garden screws the following day. Six days post-operation with an uneventful recovery he was transferred to the intermediate care centre where he remained for 5 weeks before he was allowed home with the relevant physio, OT and social work input to ensure a successful return home. His initial recovery was very good, however, after 2 - 3 months his right hip deteriorated due to increase levels of pain especially while sitting, this pain radiated to his right knee. He was assessed in the clinic in March exhibiting reduced mobility due to the increased pain, x-ray of his hip showed collapse of the fracture with subsequent penetration of the hip joint by the garden screws. These screws were removed on . When Mr  returned to the clinic in October he was in a lot of pain, especially at night and after long periods of inactivity. The x-ray showed that the fractured hip had completely fallen apart and would need a total hip replacement to improve his mobility and pain levels. The Charnely® total hip replacement was carried out on the . In the next few days he will be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital prior to discharge home. <heading>Past medical history:</heading><list>Correction of squint as a childRepair of left inguinal hernia during his 20'sHe has never had an MI, CVA, or been diagnosed with diabetes, asthma, hypertension or high cholesterol</list><heading>Family history:</heading>Nil of note <heading>Drug history and allergies:</heading>NKDA <list>Co-codamol 30/500 QDSFrusemide 40mg OD Ferrous sulphate 200mg ODLactulose PRNSenna PRN</list><heading>Social history:</heading>He is a widower and lives alone in a first floor flat. He worked for  for the last 25 years of employment before retiring 7 years ago. He is an ex-smoker and has a 20 pack year history. He is teetotal. He lives opposite a convenience store and was just about able at the height of his pain levels to walk to the store for his groceries. After the initial hip operation he had OT and physio assessment and help in the intermediate centre. He was given cushions to raise the level of his chairs, raised loo seat, tools to help him put on his shoes and a second handrail fitted on his stairs up to his flat (16 steps). He is able to do all ADLs. <heading>Systems review:</heading>Mr  suffers from constipation and takes lactulose. He suffers from mild nocturia needing to get up 1 - 2 times in the night. Nil else of note on systems review. <heading>Analysis of history The most likely single cause of the presentation, other possible causes and reasons for these choices. The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>As this is revision surgery after failure of the garden hip screw, causing pain and subsequent immobility; and the patient was seen post-op, this section is impossible to complete. If this patient had arrived at A&E for the first time after falling on his right side causing him to be unable to move his leg or walk the differential diagnosis would include: Intracapsular and extracapsular neck of femur fractures. If the patient has inflicted an intracapsular fracture there will be concerns over the blood supply to the head of the femur as the blood supply of the head is supplied mainly via the capsule, some by intermedullary vessels and a little from ligamentum teres. This kind of fracture will damage the blood supply to the first two and the ligamentum teres supply is often not sufficient which will cause avascular necrosis. Extracapsular fractures are easier to manage as the blood supply is not interrupted to the head of the femur, the surface area for union is larger and the femoral head is not mobile. On examination, it would be important to assess whether the leg was shortened and externally rotated which would indicate a NOF fracture. The leg would not appear like this if the injury was an anterior or posterior dislocation, although this type of injury is impossible from a fall and needing a significant force such as a car crash for this to occur [1]. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading>The patient was an elderly, thin, spectacled gentleman who was sitting comfortably in the chair, although every five minutes or so he lifted his bottom up and shifted position. He had no evidence of jaundice, anaemia, clubbing, cyanosis, or lymphadenopathy. He showed evidence of mild bilateral pitting oedema to his mid calf, probably due to the surgery and relative inactivity post-op. He was able to walk with a tripod frame and his gait appeared slightly antalgic in nature. <list><heading>Obs: Apyrexial, BP 110/63, heart rate 65 bpm, 16 RR, 100% O 2 sats</heading></list><heading>Look:</heading>On examination of his hip, the wound was covered with a dressing on the lateral aspect of his gluteal muscle. He had slight wasting of his quadriceps muscles bilaterally. There was some slight bruising around the dressing area. <heading>Feel:</heading>Both legs were normal in temperature; the wound area was not palpated. <heading>Move:</heading>Mr  was still in some quite considerable pain, therefore, movement of his hip joints were not carried out. He had been started on physiotherapy movements to help build up and strengthen his legs in each plane of movement and he was happy with his progress. He didn't have pain or stiffness in any other joints <heading>Analysis of history and examination Reasons for your choice of the cause of the patient's problem(s) and any other cause that still needs to be considered at this stage</heading>This is once again an impossible section to fill out as the diagnosis is known which is the revision of slipped garden screws to a Charnley® THR. His other concerns include returning to as full a pain-free range of movements as possible, to ensure his independence is maintained and enable his return home to his flat. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>An elderly gentleman who fractured his neck of femur in  and has had considerable pain and immobility post-fracture and fixation. He lives alone, in a first floor flat, which poses social problems in terms of his independence and ability to self-care. Fracturing your hip from a fall would indicate that there is a likely to be osteoporosis in his hips and perhaps elsewhere that needs to be looked at and treated with bisphophonates etc, to reduce risks of further fractures and disability. His increasing age in itself will also contribute to risk factures of a general anaesthetic, if it is needed in the future. The average lifetime of a THR is about 10 - 15 years, this would mean there is a possibility of needing it revised in the future which could pose further risks. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management. Refer to the guidelines to the writing of portfolio cases for the details of the issues to be addressed under each heading.</heading><heading>Investigations</heading>When Mr  was first admitted and the site of injury was identified he would have had an x-ray to determine the type of fracture he had incurred. His obs would also need to be monitored regularly to indicate his levels of shock, as fracture of a long bone can cause considerable hypovolaemic shock without obvious external signs. His bloods should be taken to check for his haemoglobin levels (FBC), his iron and ferritin levels (as it was known from his drug history that he suffers from anaemia), check for signs of infection (ESR, WBC, CRP), his U&Es and creatinine levels (kidney function) and LFTs (further general levels of fitness). An AP chest x-ray should be taken to see for fitness for a general anaesthetic An ECG should be recorded to look for any recent, past MIs; arrhythmias (brady or tachy) and bundle branch block. <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading>Mr  would need to be reassured at every stage of his management. He would need to be fully informed as to what had happened and the need for an operation and why a certain fixation technique will be used. During follow-up, any concerns or problems Mr  has would need to be addressed as and when they arise. <heading>Prescription/medical intervention</heading>Mr  would have been put on anti-coagulation medication to reduce the risk of thrombus and possible DVTs or strokes. It would be important to make sure Mr 's pain levels were kept under control post-op especially, as well as day-to-day. This medication might need to be added to his current list. All his other medications would have continued, keeping a close eye on his haemoglobin levels. <heading>Observation</heading>Mr  has been observed on the ward for the past 10 days and has had consultant, nursing, OT and physio input to help ensure his maximal health levels are achieved. He will be transferred, once his initial recovery from the THR is complete to a rehabilitation hospital to continue physio treatment to ensure he returns to as near a full level of movement as possible. He will be seen for a number of years post-op in the consultants follow-up clinics. <heading>Referral and team working</heading>The people that would have been involved in Mr 's care are: A&E staff, Consultant orthopaedic surgeon and team, nurses, HCAs, physio, OTs, social workers and his GP. <heading>Advice and prevention</heading>Mr  has been given a booklet that shows in picture format the type of movements he should be achieving and when, so that he can monitor his own progress. The OT will have re-assessed his flat to ensure that all risks of further falls are reduced. He will be advised as to the best ways of transferring from bed to chair etc to also reduce falls. <heading>Outcome A description of the progress of the patient as far as possible. This should include consideration of further issues to be resolved. Where appropriate you should contact by telephone patients who have been discharged home.</heading>Transferred to an intermediate/rehabilitation hospital in the move towards discharging him home with little or no social care input needed. <heading>Evidence based care and issues for research A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s)</heading><heading>Internal fixation versus arthroplasty for intracapsular hip fracture: </heading>The studies highlight that most orthopaedic surgeons tend to favour arthroplasty in older people because of the increased occurrence of complications such as non-union and avascular necrosis after internal fixation, causing increased re-operation rate. Preservation of the femoral head is generally preferred in people who are under 60 years old because it is likely the arthroplasty will not outlive the patient and will need to be replaced in 12 - 15 years time. In summary the reviews and RCTs showed that in older people with displaced intracapsular fractures found internal fixation increased the need for further revision surgery compared with arthroplasty. However, internal fixation had fewer operative risks such as reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements, as well as reducing deep wound infections. No clear difference was shown in mortality or long-term functional outcome [2,3,4] <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>In the UK there are 50,000 hip fractures per year. This fracture most often occurs in women in their 80th or 90th decade. This is usually due to the bone being weakened by an underlying disease - most commonly, osteoporosis but other causes include osteomalacia, diabetes and alcoholism. There is usually a history of trauma although there is a debate as to whether 'patients fall because they fracture or fracture because they fall'. <list><heading>Independent risk factors include:</heading>Low body weight Physical inactivity Smoking Maternal history of hip fracture Use of long-acting benzodiazepines Impaired vision</list>The risk of hip fracture may be reduced by the use of hip protectors. Femoral neck fractures as mentioned earlier, that are intracapsular, may disrupt any or all of the blood supply to the femoral head. As well as the damage to the blood supply, the intracapsular nature of the fracture can slow recovery due to either: A weak callus formation response as intra-articular bone has only a thin periosteum Blood remains inside the joint capsule, which increases the intracapsular pressure causing further damage to the femoral head and articular cartilage. This is exacerbated further by the synovial fluid, which increases blood clotting time. On examination, the affected side is shortened and externally rotated. This is because the femoral shaft now moves independently of the hip joint so that ilio-psoas and gravity rotate the femur externally rather than the hip internally. <heading>Garden's classification of femoral neck fracture:</heading>Garden's classification describes the amount of displacement and impaction. This classification relies only upon the appearance of the hip on the AP x-ray. It is used to determine the appropriate treatment: Stage I - incomplete fracture of the neck (abducted or impacted) Stage II - complete without displacement Stage III - complete with partial displacement; fragments are still connected by posterior retinacular attachment; there is malalignment of the femoral trabeculae Stage IV - this is a complete femoral neck fracture with full displacement: the proximal fragment is free and lies correctly in the acetabulum so that the trabeculae appear normally aligned There is a high rate of non-union and avascular necrosis in displaced fractures. A fracture that is not displaced or impacted carries a good prognosis. Treatment of the fracture depends on the type of fracture sustained and the age of the patient. Displaced fractures are treated surgically, by internal fixation, or prosthetic replacement, as discussed in the box above. Patients receiving internal fixation should be encouraged to mobilise early but rehabilitation on the whole is prolonged, in comparison to prosthetic replacement [1,5]. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading>Fractures of the proximal femur, possible fixation techniques and why they are used.
