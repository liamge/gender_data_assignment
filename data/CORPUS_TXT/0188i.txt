<heading>Titanium Dioxide</heading><heading>1)</heading>The Oxidation state of titanium in TiO 2 is +4, it cannot be further oxidised since it has no more valence electrons that can be removed. <heading>2)</heading>Titanium Dioxide is colourless since it has no d-shell electrons that can absorb light (E=hÏ…) and be excited to a higher energy state, thus it reflects the whole visible spectrum. <heading>Pigments</heading><heading>3)</heading>The main characteristics of a good pigment are to colour the environment in which it is on, and make the object it lies on opaque. A good pigment should prevent the transmission of light through a medium, thus obscuring the object is on. Light hits a pigment- the light can be absorbed totally (black pigment), reflected totally (white pigment) or absorb certain frequencies of radiation (coloured pigment). <heading>4) Rutile:</heading><heading>Advantages:</heading>Rutile reflects radiation better than anatase in all but the very blue end of the visible spectrum. Rutile absorbs more UV radiation, and this removes the amount of energy available to degrade the system, making it more durable than anatase. <heading>Disadvantages:</heading>Absorbs UV radiation, and creates radicals, which can then attack the surface the TiO 2 coats. <heading>Uses:</heading>Due to their superior durability, they are used in all paints and plastic applications. They are also used in paper laminate applications, where high opacity is essential. <heading>Anatase:</heading><heading>Advantages:</heading>Hard pigment, thus useful for abrasive environments. Notably bluer tone than rutile. System does not absorb as much UV radiation thus not creating radicals. <heading>Disadvantages:</heading>System does not absorb UV radiation, thus makes it less durable than rutile Reflection of light is not as good or as bright as rutile <heading>Uses:</heading>Delustering of synthetic fibres, where the colour is degraded due to long periods of contact with machinery during processing and is used in some ceramics. <heading>5)</heading>UV absorption in Titanium Dioxide pigments can be a problem, since it will create radicals, which then can attack the object, the TiO 2 is coated with. If this was PVC, the long carbon chains would eventually start to break down, after large exposure times to UV radiation. <heading>Titanium Dioxide Industry</heading><heading>6)</heading>A green field development is when a piece of usually semirural land that is undeveloped (except for agricultural use), is considered as a site for expanding urban development. <heading>7) Sulphate Process</heading><heading>Advantages:</heading>Can produce both rutile and anatase forms of TiO 2, whereas Chloride process can only produce rutile. Low capital investment is required to set up a sulphate plant, and lower production costs <heading>Disadvantages:</heading>Produces large amounts (double of useful product) of waste products: Iron Salts, Gypsum, CO 2 and H 2SO 4. All of which have to be disposed of, but can be sold on as by-products. Since Sulphate process can use anatase and rutile to produce TiO 2, this can cause contamination during the process <heading>Chloride Process</heading><heading>Advantages:</heading>Least environmentally damaging, and produces less by-products. Can only product TiO 2 from rutile, thus no contamination can occur. <heading>Disadvantages:</heading>Large set up cost and running cost of production, due to high energy costs. Lower availability of raw materials also makes process more expensive. Produces hazardous waste substances such as Cl 2, and TiCl 4 is used in the production process. <heading>8)</heading>To run an industry at full capacity for extended periods can be bad since: Production costs are huge to run at full capacity Extra staff would be required to deal with the extra demands of operating equipment - increasing staffing requirements. Once full capacity is achieved no extra capacity can be demanded Equipment was probably not built to withstand extended periods of full capacities.
