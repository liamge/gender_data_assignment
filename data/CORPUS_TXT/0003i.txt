The first meeting of Marx and Engels in Paris in 1844 marked the starting point of a legendary friendship and cooperation of two thinkers who left an enormous mark on political development in the twentieth century and whose influence, in the words of a critic, can only be compared to that of Jesus or Mohammed. <fnote>V.I. Lenin, 'Karl Marx', in Marx - Engels - Marxism (Moscow, 1951), p. 17. </fnote><fnote>Peter Singer, Marx (Rotterdam, 1999), p. 10. </fnote>As the philosophes of the enlightenment had posed a theory of a developing and progressing world, Marx and Engels concerned themselves with applying this model of development to society. Marx placed all history in terms of classes struggling through their relation to material welfare and the means of production. As atheistic followers of Hegel, Marx and Engels thus came to believe that 'the struggle against existing wrong and prevalent evil, is also rooted in the universal law of eternal development'. <fnote>V.I. Lenin, 'Frederick Engels' in Marx - Engels - Marxism, p. 58. </fnote>Marx and Engels lived at a time in which rapid industrialisation brought about exceeding disparities between the property-owning class (the bourgeoisie) and the working class (the proletariat). Believing capitalism to be only another step toward a society without class antagonisms, Marx turned to studying history and economics, while Engels in 1845 published The Condition of the Working Class in England. In this work, Engels drew from direct experience and a wide range of sources, arguing that the working class was becoming increasingly conscious of its place and relation to the bourgeoisie, which would in the end inevitably lead to a proletarian revolution. Marx and Engels were deeply impressed when, in 1844, factory workers revolted in Silesia and Bohemia. They observed unrest all over Europe, and thus became convinced of the revolutionary potential of the proletariat; a potential which would eventually carry humanity into the next stage of socialism. <fnote>Lenin, 'Frederick Engels', p. 60. </fnote><fnote>Victor Kiernan, 'History', in David McLellan (ed.), Marx: The First Hundred Years (Oxford, 1983), p. 60. </fnote>From circumstance and experience, Marx and Engels were not so much concerned with democracy, but rather with the greater concept of freedom and creating a freer society, in which, they argued, the state would cease to be necessary. Parliamentary democracy, in the eyes of Marx and Engel, was nothing more than the crystallisation of the contradictory interests between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and could not be different. Moreover, by separating the government from civil society, 'the bourgeois state and its attendant ideas of political rights and common national interests functioned, like religion, as an opium, an illusory compensation and thus a support for the injustices of civil society'. A radical change was needed for the advance at first of the proletariat and eventually of society as a whole. In their own words 'Not criticism but revolution is the driving force of history'. <fnote>Singer, Marx, p. 104. </fnote><fnote>David McLellan, 'Politics', in David McLellan (ed.), Marx: The First Hundred Years (Oxford, 1983), pp. 145-46. </fnote><fnote>Kiernan, 'History', p. 62. </fnote>Marx and Engels became convinced that they had discovered a scientific model of society and its inevitable future. Marx's drive to act upon theory soon brought him into international communist circles. After heated debate at a congress in London in 1847, Marx and Engels were commissioned to write a political programme for the Communist League. Its result, the Communist Manifesto, can be regarded as Marx's and Engels' most outspoken vision on class struggle and the predestined faith of the proletariat. 'The proletariat', the Communist Manifesto stated confidently, 'goes through various stages of development'. Then, the manifesto goes on to speak in deterministic terms that the proletarian 'mission is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property'.  <fnote>Singer, Marx, pp. 14-15. </fnote><fnote>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, cited in University of Warwick Insite, Department of History (20 November 2003),  URL  (21 December 2004). </fnote><fnote>Ibid. </fnote>If this scenario were to be the inevitable course of events, the logical question would be: why? Analysing history, Marx and Engels had discovered a continuous struggle for power between a powerful minority and a weak majority. They noted that 'All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities'. However, it seemed that the proletariat would be able to break through this tendency. 'The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority'. In this sense, it can be argued that for Marx and Engels, a primitive idea of democratic, or majority, rights served to justify a complex social theory of inevitable revolutionary struggle. Convinced about the power and improvement value of the theory of class struggle, 'His [Engels'] and Marx's historical vision was optimistic about the future, tragic when it turned to the past, as a record so dreadfully bad that any sacrifice was worth while to get away from it'.  <fnote>Ibid. </fnote><fnote>Kiernan, 'History', p. 72. </fnote>When Lenin became leader of the Bolsheviks in the early twentieth century, a debate among Marxists had been around for nearly fifteen years concerning the best way to bring about communism. One section of the Second International of 1889, under the leadership of Bernstein, had come to embrace the idea of social democracy, and of participation in parliamentary politics. Where Marx had been careful in his wording, or more abstract in his discussion of the democracy question, Lenin was more articulate in his discussion of the matter. He briefly defined the state as 'a special organization of force: it is an organization of violence for the suppression of some class'. Therefore, he argued, a revolution was the necessary agent for the transition from capitalism to socialism. <fnote>McLellan, 'Politics', p. 167. </fnote>In 1905 Lenin wrote Two Tactics, an article discussing the political direction Russia should take after the revolution. In this article he advocated a 'revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry', a term that Marx had used only once, in a letter to a friend. What contrasted the Bolsheviks from the anarchists, Lenin argued, was that Bolsheviks thought it necessary to establish a transitory government to place the proletariat firm in the seat of power. However, months before the October revolution, in April 1917, he wrote that this would be 'a state without a standing army, without a police opposed to the people, without an officialdom placed above the people', based on Marx's example of his view of the Paris Commune. Eventually, in Engels' words, the government would slowly 'wither away' because it would become unnecessary. <fnote>Ibid, p. 161. </fnote><fnote>Ibid, pp. 154-55. </fnote><fnote>V.I. Lenin, 'Letters on Tactics' in Marx - Engels - Marxism, p. 58. </fnote><fnote>McLellan, 'Politics', p. 168 </fnote>Some of Lenin's writing, though, already revealed some of the authoritarian traces that were to characterise the Bolsheviks' policy and the Soviet Union's later political development. Convinced, like Marx, of the inevitability of a proletarian revolution, he remarked: 'I said that there can be no government (apart from a bourgeois government) in Russia other than a government of the Soviets of Workers', Agricultural Labourers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies'. <fnote>Lenin, 'Letters on Tactics', pp. 389-90. </fnote>By 1917, Lenin observed that the key conditions were fulfilled in Russia for a proletarian revolution to take place. An imperialist war was raging over Europe, according to Marxist theory calling in the culmination of capitalism. Conditions in Russia, he argued, were peculiar, as the country had already seen a revolution in February 1917. 'We have existing side by side, together, simultaneously, both the rule of the bourgeoisie [...] and a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, which is voluntarily ceding power to the bourgeoisie, voluntarily transforming itself into an appendage of the bourgeoisie'. According to Lenin, the masses had 'been confused, led astray and deceived' by the temporary government of Lvov and Kerensky. He adopted Trotsky's idea of 'permanent revolution', arguing that the proletariat could not stop after overthrowing the bourgeois government. By not completing the dictatorship of the proletariat, the government itself had gone over to the side of the bourgeoisie.  <fnote>Columbia Encyclopedia, 'Vladimir Ilych Lenin: Theoretician and Revolutionary', Encyclopedia.com (2004),  URL  (27 December 2004). </fnote><fnote>Lenin, 'Letters on Tactics', p. 386. </fnote><fnote>V.I. Lenin, 'The Task of the Proletariat in Our Revolution' in Marx - Engels - Marxism, p. 380. </fnote>In practice, much of Lenin's writing at the dawn of the October revolution appears to excuse the Bolsheviks' grasp for power and subsequent policy. Eventually, Bolshevik rule directly after the revolution proved to be highly undemocratic. In 1918, all political parties that did not support the Bolsheviks were systematically suppressed; while a temporary oligarchic, highly centralised government was formed, taking in members by co-option rather than by democratic elections. Rosa Luxemburg was among the prominent critics of Lenin's post-revolution, oppressive policy. 'The negative, the tearing down, can be decreed; the building up, the positive cannot', she argued. According to her, Lenin was standing in the way of a democratic learning process of the proletariat. 'The broadest democracy was needed', otherwise 'socialism will be decreed from behind a few official desks by a dozen intellectuals'. Although Lenin argued that such policy was needed in 'defence against counterrevolution and the actual elimination of everything that contradicted the sovereignty of the people', this, according to Luxemburg, was 'not the dictatorship of the proletariat, [...] but only the dictatorship of a handful of politicians'. <fnote>McLellan, 'Politics', p. 170. </fnote><fnote>Ibid, p. 163. </fnote><fnote>Rosa Luxemburg, The Russian Revolution and Leninism or Marxism? , cited in University of Warwick Insite, Department of History (20 November 2003),  URL  (27 December 2004). </fnote><fnote>V.I. Lenin, 'Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution' in Marx - Engels - Marxism, p. 177. </fnote><fnote>Rosa Luxemburg, The Russian Revolution. </fnote>By 1921, Lenin described the Soviet Union as 'a workers' state with bureaucratic distortion'. Trotsky actually became regretful, stating in a meeting that 'things are heading towards ruin'. Stalin, however, asserted in 1918 that at the time, the 'Bolsheviks did not doubt that bourgeois parliamentarism and the bourgeois-democratic republic represented a past stage of the revolution'. <fnote>McLellan, 'Politics', p. 171. </fnote><fnote>Joseph Stalin, The October Revolution (London, 1936), p. 168. </fnote><fnote>Stalin, The October Revolution, p. 22. </fnote>It is hard to place Stalin's policy in an unmitigated Marxist light. Despite its rhetoric, the Soviet Union of Stalin appeared to many something other than socialism. Theory was increasingly not matching policy. The state did not wither away, instead, a status quo of power was developing; one in which all lines came together in Moscow. An elite of scientifically based professional revolutionaries would 'show the way, formulating the program and policies, educating the people, and working out the strategy and tactics'. The character of the government had changed since the October revolution. Stalin's biographer, Deutscher, wrote: 'It has assumed office as a government of the people, by the people and for the people [...][now,] it ceases to be government by the people'. Indeed, it is arguable that the rapid industrialisation and agricultural reforms represented some elevated aspiration of the proletariat and peasants, however, the price of these reforms (The 1936 Great Terror and show trials) was disproportionate and tragic. Moreover, they revealed a highly undemocratic and unrepresentative government that stood separate from the masses. <fnote>McLellan, 'Politics', p.173. </fnote><fnote>Albert Weisbord, 'Bolshevism, Fraudulent Practice Of Democratic Centralism' cited in Weisbord.org (November/December 1976),  URL  (28 December 2004). </fnote><fnote>I. Deutscher, Stalin: A Political Biography (Oxford, 1950), p. 175. </fnote><fnote>McLellan, 'Politics', p. 173. </fnote>The approximately hundred-year period over which the intellectual and political activity of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin spread has seen the emergence of an immense social and political experiment of revolution and the move toward a communist state. The concept of democracy has over this time been much debated and scrutinised in order to deprive it of its 'bourgeois' elements. However, in the theories of Marx and Engels, there has been too little space left open for a pluralistic approach to state organisation. Likewise, Lenin and Stalin never achieved the 'withering away of the state' into a 'revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat' upon the gap that fell after the October revolution of 1917. Communism, or some pure form of democracy within society's organisation has never been achieved. <fnote>Singer, Marx, p. 103. </fnote>
