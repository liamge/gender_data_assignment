<heading>Physical Structure and Composition of ice cream</heading>Ice cream is a complicated physiochemical system-colloidal system. Air cells are dispersed in a continuous liquid phase with embedded ice crystals. The liquid phase also contains solidified fat globules, milk proteins, insoluble salts, lactose crystals in some cases, stabilizers of colloidal dimension, sugars and soluble salts in solution. The finished product consists of liquid, air and solid, giving a three phase system. A typical ice cream contains about 30% ice, 50% air, 5% fat and 15% matrix (sugar solution) by volume. The ingredients of ice cream may be classified in three groups: <list>Major ingredients, such as milk protein, sugar, fat and water.Minor ingredients (<1%), such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, colours and flavours. Modifying components, such as chocolate, biscuits, wafers, fruit pieces and nuts that are combined with ice cream to make products (Clark, 2004). </list><heading>Milk Proteins</heading>Cow's milk contains about 87% water. The remainder consists of fat (4%), proteins (3.5%), lactose (4.8%) and small quantities of inorganic salts. Basically, milk contains two main types of protein: casein (80%) and whey proteins (20%). Casein and whey proteins are distinguished by their differing solubility at pH 4.6 (at 20°C), caseins are insoluble, whereas whey proteins are soluble (Clark, 2004). Most of the casein proteins are present as colloidal particles, known as casein micelles (Swaisgood, 1992). Caseins are phosphoproteins. The phosphate groups are responsible for many of the important characteristics of casein, especially its ability to bind relatively large amounts of calcium, making it a very nutritionally valuable protein. All caseins have a high content (35-45%) of apolar amino acids (Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, Tyr, Pro) and would be expected to be poorly soluble in aqueous system. However, a high content of phosphate groups, low level of sulphur containing amino acids, and high carbohydrate content in the case of κ-casein, offset the influence of apolar amino acids. Caseins are quite stable to heat denaturation, but can be denatured by excessive heat, leading to aggregation and precipitation. As caseins are very surface active, and make good emulsifiers. Also, casein's high water binding capacity creates high viscosity in casein solutions. Consequently, casein has desirable functional properties for incorporating into instant desserts (Fox & McSweeney, 1998). <heading>Whey Protein Concentrate</heading>Whey protein contains two well-defined groups, which could be fractionated by saturated MgSO 4 or half-saturated NH 4SO 4; the precipitate (roughly 20% of the total nitrogen) was called a lactoglobulin and the soluble protein was lactalbumin (Fox & McSweeney, 1998). The major advantage of whey protein's application in food industry is its nutritional quality. The main whey product developed-to-date is probably whey protein concentrate (WPC). Commercially available WPCs contain from 35% to 95% protein, 6-10% lactose, 4-6% fat, 3-5% ash and 3-4% moisture. The functions of WPCs in food products can be related to the functionality of their proteins. Interactions between proteins and other molecules within a food system are necessary for a protein to manifest its functionality (Zadow, 1992). The five tables below represent a more detailed review of the composition and functionalities of whey protein in ice cream and other food systems, and also possible modifications on whey proteins during food processing. <table/><table/><table/><table/><table/><heading>Stabilizers in ice cream</heading>Stabilizers are used in such small amounts as to have a negligible influence on food value, but will modify the physical and sensory properties of ice cream. For instance by: <list> Prevent the formation of objectionable large ice crystals. High water-binding capacity effective in smoothening the texture, giving body to the finished product and giving desired resistance to melting; thus impact indirectly on flavour. Increase viscosity and have no effect on the freezing point, hardly limit whipping ability.Prevent coarsening of texture under temperature fluctuations (Arbuckle, 1972).</list><heading>Stability of Ice Cream</heading><heading> Ageing</heading>Ageing takes place before ice cream mixture goes on freezing process. Commercial ageing time is 3 to 4 hours, within which longer ageing time is beneficial. The beneficial changes occurring in ageing are listed below: <list>Solidifying fat.Protein of the mix may be changed slightly and the viscosity increases.Improve the smoothness of the body and texture, resistance to melting and  ease of whipping (Arbuckle, 1972).</list><heading>Basic factors affecting ice cream meltdown</heading>The meltdown properties of ice cream are related with its eating properties. Basically, meltdown properties are determined by two parameters, one is the melting rate; the other is the shape retention of ice cream during melting. There are several factors impacting on the meltdown properties of ice cream, as presented below: An increased fat agglomeration index (FAI) provides structural rigidity to ice cream so that the melting rate becomes lower and better shape retention results. Certain emulsifiers (e.g. unsaturated monoglycerides) destabilize the fat globules and increase the fat agglomeration, giving a more rigid structure. Additionally, agitation and the concentration effect of freezing increases FAI. The lower the freezing-point of the mix, the more ice crystals will melt at a given temperature. Proteins may affect the structure and melting properties. Structure formed by fat and proteins in ice cream has a combined influence on the shape-retention during melting. Samples submitted to heat shock conditions melts more slowly than when fresh, possibly due to the larger ice crystals formed (Buchheim, 1998). <heading>Sensory Evaluation of Ice Cream</heading><heading> Introduction to methods:</heading>Ice cream offers a unique combination of highly desirable sensory properties. Those properties can be classified under the categories appearance (colour, smoothness...), aroma (smell perceived by sniffing), flavour (taste, smell perceived retronasally, trigeminal sensations) and body/texture/mouthfeel (hardness, viscosity, creaminess, grittiness and gumminess). To assess the sensory properties of ice cream, analytical sensory tests, such as difference tests and descriptive analysis, should be used with trained panels to provide qualitative and quantitative information. Instrumental measurements of sensory properties are used as a necessary complement to sensory analytical tests, particularly for colour and texture/mouthfeel assessments. Affective tests, such as hedonic scaling or preference tests, can be used with consumer representative of the target population to assess product acceptance (Buchheim, 1998). The table below displays various common sensory analytical methods and their corresponding statistical data-analysis approaches: <table/><heading>Preparation and evaluation sequence of ice cream:</heading>In order to ascertain the desired body and texture characteristics of ice cream for assessment, samples should be stored at the temperature range between -18°C to -15°C (Bodyfelt, et al., 1988). An efficient orderly sequence of evaluations is presented below to conquer the rapid change of the physical condition of ice cream while in ordinary temperature. <list>Colour observation - (intensity, uniformity, natural or unnatural)Aroma detection - (by sniffing)Flavour evaluation - (basic tastes, aroma by volatile/flavour-contributing substances, trigeminal sensations)Body-Texture evaluation (by rolling the sample between incisors and pressing it against the roof of mouth to detect the smoothness)Sense delayed taste-reaction (Bodyfelt, et al. , 1988).</list><heading>Intrinsic impact on ice cream sensory properties</heading><table/><heading>Conclusion of this review</heading>Whey protein concentrate plays a significant role in ice cream, as it introduces various impacts on both physiochemical and sensory properties of ice cream by its intrinsic characteristics and also through interactions with other ingredients in the colloidal system.
