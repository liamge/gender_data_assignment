<abstract>A ~5kb sequence from a bacteriophage that infects Synechococcus was analysed and found to contain five open reading frames whose translated products showed homology to other proteins in the databases. Genes homologous to gp13, gp14, gp15 and gp16 from bacteriophage T4 were identified, of which gps13-15 are structural proteins and gp16 is the small subunit of the DNA transferase enzyme. A gene that is likely to encode a transcriptional regulatory protein was also identified. Structural elements of these proteins were predicted. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>"Bioinformatics is a new area, comprising the analysis of biological sequence information, recovery of evolutionary patterns, prediction of gene function, biological data mining and "silicon-based biology"." There are now many freely available tools for the study of Bioinformatics available on the Internet that are useful for analysing newly sequenced genomes. In this project, I perform a series of analyses on a ~5kb DNA sequence from a bacteriophage that infects marine cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus in order to identify the genes present and predict their function. <enote>Mann NH (2004)  URL  </enote>Many viruses are found in marine ecosystems and one of those is known as S-PM2, which is studied by Mann et al at the University of . "S-PM2 is a lytic cyanomyovirus virus with an icosahedral head and long contractile tail, which infects marine Synechococcus strains and has been shown to have a genome of ~194 kb." S-PM2 shares a conserved genetic module with its archetypal bacteriophage T4, which infects Escherichia coli, and this module encodes major virion proteins2. It is therefore possible that any proteins in our assessment sequence will have significant homology with bacteriophage T4. Interestingly, S-PM2 has also been shown by Mann et al to encode versions of the photosynthetic proteins D1 and D2, which make up photosystem II that are similar to those found in Synechococcus but have better resistance to photoinhibition. <enote>Mann NH (unknown date) Impact of bacteriophages on photosynthesis in the oceans.

No other ORFs returned blast results that showed significant similarity to any sequences in any of the databases. I also used the more sensitive Smith-Waterman Homology search at DISC to confirm blast results and check the smaller translated polypeptides for similar proteins. <enote> URL  </enote><heading>Discussion</heading>From my analysis, I feel I can reasonably confidently conclude that the assessment DNA sequence was obtained from a T4-like bacteriophage such as S-PM2, since it appears to contain many homologous genes to those found in T4. It was previously known that S-PM2 shares a conserved genetic module with T4 that contains genes for structural proteins that make up the virion, so it is not surprising to find genes for two neck/collar proteins and a tail sheath protein in this sequence. Interestingly, genes similar to T4's gp13 to gp16 were found in the assessment sequence in the same order.  <enote> URL  </enote>12The structure of bacteriophage T4 is shown to the right. Gp13 and gp14 are neck proteins that protrude from the head/tail connection. Gp15 is a protein that is required to complete assembly of the T4 tail as it forms the connector, which allows it to bind to the head. <enote>Zhao L, Kanamaru S, Chaidirek C, & Arisaka F (2003) P15 and P3, the Tail Completion Proteins of Bacteriophage T4, Both Form Hexameric Rings. Journal of Bacteriology. 185(5): 1693-1700. </enote><picture/>Gp16 and gp17 make up the small and large subunits respectively of the T4 enzyme terminase, which is required for DNA packaging. The assessment sequence contained an ORF that probably encodes the small subunit for a terminase enzyme in the Synechococcus-infecting bacteriophage. Horizontal gene transfer is important for evolution of marine Synechococcus and it has been shown that this process is mediated by bacteriophages. I predict that the helix-turn-helix motif predicted by PHD between residues 44 and 105 is a DNA-binding finger motif14. The predicted coiled-coil in this region would also be evidence for this. The gene for the large subunit, gp17, which contains 610 amino acid residues, is not present in the assessment sequence. <enote>Lin H, Simon MN& Black LW (1997) Purification and characterization of the small subunit of phage T4 terminase, gp16, required for DNA packaging .

Ecol.  46: 349-352. </enote>The ORF between nucleotides 3170 and 3712 is likely to code for a transcriptional regulatory protein because of its homology with those from E.coli and R.rubrum and because it was not predicted to be globular. It is not possible to tell, however, which genes it regulates from sequence data alone.
