For Francis Fukuyama, John Ruggie, and other reputed international relations experts, the end of the Cold War heralded the emergence of a "new world order". The shift away from a bipolar distribution of power that these analysts have in mind, however, is only one aspect of this transformation; perhaps more importantly, the stage of world politics has recently been invaded by a host of transnational actors. As transnational cooperations, non-governmental organisations and superstate institutions gain influence in global debate, they may "call into question the primacy of states" by challenging their sovereignty. Some even warn that international organisations can be used by powerful states as tools to secure their hegemony. These somewhat pessimistic forecasts may be exaggerated, however; if transnational actors can be made accountable to civil society, they will more likely reform rather than annihilate the Westphalian system. Through the emergence of "global governance", transnational actors can become a positive force for change in today's world order. <fnote>Ruggie p554 </fnote><fnote>Kaldor p583 </fnote><fnote>Cronin p103 </fnote><fnote>Barnett </fnote>In popular belief, some of the most powerful and potentially threatening actors of the current international stage may be transnational coorperations (TNCs), firms which hold branches, subsidiaries and production facilities outside their own country. These have proliferated in recent years, emerging even in developing countries. According to Peter Willetts, their growth and the scale of their activities leaves "the sovereignty of most governments . . . significantly reduced". As TNCs have highly mobile production facilities, they can easily move out of a host country if its policy is no longer attractive to them. Due to such 'regulatory arbitrage', host governments must compete for a firm's presence by lowering taxes, relaxing regulation, or improving particular infrastructures ; major aspects of state policy thus become dictated by the needs of the TNC. In Indonesia, for instance, the government has voluntarily relaxed environmental laws in order to accommodate the American mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold. This firm's "importance to Indonesia's treasury . . . ha[s] helped secure it against challenges from local people [and] environmental groups"  in spite of the considerable environmental damage that it causes in the Papuan region. Morevoer, TNC's can cause states to lose control not only of policy, but also of currency and foreign trade, as the bulk of financial flows generated by these companies leads to considerable fluctuations in a currency's exchange rate and in a country's current account. Furthermore, companies can occasionally evade state supervision altogether, for example by transfer pricing, where TNC's transfer their funds from one country to another to avoid taxation. In cases where firms follow directives from extraterritorial headquarters, domestic branches may be subject to the policy of a foreign government and may disregard domestic regulation. TNCs can indeed pose very real threats to state sovereignty. <fnote>Willetts p363 </fnote><fnote>Willetts p363 </fnote><fnote>Perlez and Raymond </fnote><fnote>Willetts pp363 - 365 </fnote>Beyond the impact of TNCs, the growth of transnational actors also worries states by fostering the development of a "global civil society". Modern voluntary associations seek to shape social rules by gaining independence from the state, engaging in transnational public debate, and becoming globally connected. In particular, the number of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) is "skyrocketing worldwide" thanks to improved communications technology and higher levels of education. NGOs are generally seen as potentially destabilising activist movements that have been 'tamed' and institutionalised, yet it is this "formalised part of this civil society" that governments most fear. As legally recognised entities or 'insiders' to the political process, NGOs have acquired considerable influence and autonomy in decision-making processes. Transparency International, for instance, builds public pressure against corruption, lobbies individual governments to advocate policy reform, and monitors the compliance of states to multilateral conventions. Submitting NGOs to a state's domestic regulations may consequently be difficult, leading governments to extreme measures: the United States government, for instance, recently launched an NGO-monitoring project threatening certain organisations with loss of funding if they did not adhere to its policies. Such antagonism suggests that today's transnational civil society can limit the sovereignty of even the most dominant states. <fnote>Kaldor p583 </fnote><fnote>Kaldor p585 </fnote><fnote>Florini p72 </fnote><fnote>Kaldor p585 </fnote><fnote>Florini p72 </fnote><fnote>Transparency International </fnote><fnote>Florini p73 </fnote>A similar power struggle pits states against a third form of transnational actor: International Organisations (IOs). The majority of international organisations - such as the United Nations or the International Monetary Fund - have states as their constituent membership and operate within formal procedures. Nonetheless, these bodies can act with a degree of autonomy from states. According to Abbott and Snidal, this independence gives IOs considerable power to "modify the political, normative, and intellectual context of state interactions": thus, the UN Commission on Latin America was the source of many of the economic development concepts that influenced the formation of the Group of 77. Additionally, by centralising different states' interests, IOs can alter states' perceptions of their conflicts and hence influence the terms and outcomes of their interactions. By shaping the norms, values and preferences of member states, International Organisations acquire significant power over the decision-making processes in the international system. <fnote>Abbot and Snidal p17 </fnote><fnote>Abbot and Snidal p17 </fnote>Indeed, the influence that IOs exert on state policy can directly "challenge the state's monopoly on decision-making authority at the global level". IOs regularly serve as "managers of enforcement" in ensuring that governments comply with international commitments; by threatening to withhold their benefits or to apply sanctions if states renege from these obligations, IOs truly diminish the extent to which states are sovereign to choose their own courses of action. Moreover, certain political figures propose to strengthen the role of IOs in areas linked still more closely to state sovereignty, such as security. The previous UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for example, advocated the creation of a UN standing army, arguing that issues of domestic security were a "legitimate concern of the United Nations because [they] ha[d] the potential to undermine regional security." Likewise, the 1993 Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans called for a greater use of sanctions by the UN, which would enable this organisation to establish international regimes for peace enforcement. Such changes would allow transnational actors to infringe traditional aspects of state sovereignty to an even greater degree. <fnote>Abbott and Snidal p18 </fnote><fnote>Boutros-Boutros Ghali (1995), Agenda for Peace, in Barnett </fnote><fnote>Gareth Evans (1993), Cooperating for Peace, in Barnett </fnote>Not all political theorists see transnational actors strictly as threats to state power, however. Alternative interpretations suggest that NGOs, IOs and even TNCs could be tools by which dominant states of the international system would reflect and promote their personal interests. Some thus suspect certain TNCs of promoting the hegemonic ideology of dominant countries - in this fashion, both Coca-Cola and MacDonald's can be perceived as part of an apparatus by which the United States disperses capitalism to the developing world. Similarly, NGOs could also be used by states to voice their own concerns through a smokescreen of democratic consultation; as critics have expressed it, "these unelected guardians of the public good . . . claim to speak for the world but in fact speak only for themselves." Indeed, the neoliberal view of civil society sees NGOs as key agents in disseminating capitalist ideology, in particular by facilitating market reform and promoting parliamentary democracy. Rather than reversing the logic of the Westphalian system, transnational actors may instead fortify existing power balances and reinforce, rather than deplete, a hegemon's sovereignty. <fnote>Florini p75 </fnote><fnote>Kaldor p586 </fnote>For many, however, such claims rest on isolated examples of partisanship, and NGOs and TNCs alike are generally accountable organisms. The case for the use of International Organisations as tools of hegemonic influence, on the other hand, is a truly convincing one. Numerous theories of international relations suggest that IOs can provide "continuing utility . . . as instruments . . . for regime and rule creation." For realists, powerful states form IOs to allow weaker states to participate in the furthering of their own interests - thus, by creating the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance at the zenith of its Cold War supremacy, the Soviet Union could share the burden of its economy with satellite states. Constructivist theory argues that IOs may help states to legitimise their prevailing ideas by setting codes of conduct that encourage certain activities. For example, Michael Barnett sees the United Nations as a norm-setter dedicated to "expand[ing] the number of actors who are committed to a liberal political order": the UN's peace-keeping operations may be a pretext to spread the US neoliberal ideology by introducing principles of democracy and human rights in turbulent states. As shown by the use of the veto in the United Nations Security Council, voting procedures in IOs can establish a certain balance of power that endows dominant states with disproportionate influence on decision-making. Additionally, the UN, the WTO and the IMF alike serve as forums that allows weaker states to voice their grievances, thus legitimising the status quo and limiting any challenges existing neoliberal international system. IOs can therefore promote a hegemon's interests by creating structures that stabilise world politics and encourage member states to adhere to the hegemon's rules. <fnote>Scholte p231 </fnote><fnote>Karns and Mingst 1990, in Abbott and Snidal p29 </fnote><fnote>Abbott and Snidal p30 </fnote><fnote>Abbott and Snidal p30 </fnote><fnote>Barnett </fnote>The predominant threat that transnational actors pose to states today thus resides in the proliferation of IOs. These bodies can fragilise the sovereignty of member states, or they may even pursue policies that favour one state at the expense of other members. At present, IOs suffer from a scarcity of democratic accountability mechanisms: their leadership is not appointed through direct elections, they lack elected legislative bodies to balance the power of their executive components, they cannot be tried in court, and they are not subject to the control of external formal policy evaluation devices. Yet, according to Scholte, the accountability of these 'global governance arrangements' could be restored if civil society was to take an active role in regulating international organisations. In particular, NGOs can increase the transparency of IO operations, as was the case in 1998 when voluntary organisations in Canada and France forced the OECD to publicly release the text of the secret Multilateral Agreement on Investment which it was debating. NGOs can also monitor global policies and seek redress in court for errors that are committed in these policies' implementation. Civil society can also promote the creation of formal accountability mechanisms to control IOs, as was done with the 1994 formation of an Inspection Panel for the World Bank. More recently, NGOs have also attempted to implement 'corporate social responsibility' (CSR) devices to ensure the accountability of TNCs. For example, Christian Aid is currently lobbying for the establishment of international, legally binding regulation of TNCs that would impose minimum human rights and environmental standards on these firms. With the necessary resources and networking, and with the support of progressive political attitudes and culture, "civil society associations [can] offer significant possibilities to increase global regulatory arrangement" - the threats posed to state sovereignty by transnational actors, and especially by IOs, may be reduced. <fnote>Scholte p212 </fnote><fnote>Scholte p212 </fnote><fnote>Scholte p220 </fnote><fnote>Scholte p224 </fnote><fnote>Christian Aid </fnote><fnote>Scholte p231 </fnote>If International Organisations can be monitored and controlled by other transnational actors, then, rather than endangering global stability, they may become "an important supplement to the decentralised cooperation of the international system." Decentralised cooperation theory holds that IOs centralise the interests of different states through stable organisational structures which significantly enhance interstate cooperation. IOs provide institutions that increase the efficiency of collective activities by pooling the assets and activities of members. This enables burden sharing between nations and reduces the risks of individual states, solving coordination problems and facilitating the otherwise contentious production of collective goods. Moreover, Keohane (1984) stresses that IOs can play a crucial role in intergovernmental bargaining: international regimes reduce the transaction costs of negotiations, improve the flow of information between states, and make any violations of multilateral agreements more costly. In this way, far from being the most threatening of transnational actors for the established international system, IOs may instead foster its proper functioning and steadiness. <fnote>Abbott and Snidal p31 </fnote><fnote>Abbott and Snidal p17 </fnote><fnote>Abbott and Snidal p20 </fnote>Yet, for many, the growing involvement of transnational actors in world politics is of little value if its only effect is to uphold the existing status quo. Rather, international relations theorists such as Snidal argue that International Organisations "often represent deliberate decisions by states to change their mutually consisted environments, and thus, themselves": IOs can and should become forces for positive change in the international system. One way in which IOs can foster such reform is through their role as sources of information. According to Alexandru Grigorescu, state interaction with IOs can lead to increased governmental transparency. Through their various activities, International Organizations collect large amounts of information from member states; as they release previously concealed and potentially disparaging information about a government to societal actors, the regime concerned may face a 'trust crisis' from its citizens. In order to prove its credibility to a society, it will tend to adopt laws that increase transparency and free flow of information. Based on empirical evidence, Grigorescu finds that IO-led growth in external information does precede the advent of democratic transparency in many countries. In turn, this transparency enhances interstate cooperation and makes collective action more effective. A strong civil society can therefore have a beneficial impact on the workings of domestic and international politics. <fnote>Abbott and Snidal p25 </fnote><fnote>Grigorescu p643 </fnote><fnote>Grigorescu p665 </fnote>The constructive role that IOs can play in improving interstate cooperation is best exemplified by the tasks currently ascribed to the United Nations. Reports composed by UN enthusiasts circa 1995 maintain that the globalizing world order needs international organizations that can mitigate the negative side-effects of modernization and resolve interstate conflicts resulting from interdependence and collective burden-sharing. IOs are believed to build confidence and transparency between members, in particular through creating monitoring mechanisms that guarantee that states will respect their commitments to international agreements. Finally, rather than endangering the stability of states, such organizations may provide states with what United Nations Secretary-General Perez de Cueller expressed as a "final confirmation of independence, nationhood, and sovereignty". International Organisations can therefore create a more peaceful international order capable of reforming the obsolete realism of the Westphalian system without endangering the states that comprise it. <fnote>Barnett </fnote>In the last few decades, states have witnessed the appearance of a great number of transnational actors in the international relations arena. The growing influence of Transnational Corporations, Non-Governmental Organisations and especially International Organisations in world politics may have ground-shaking consequences for the structure of the international system. While these new actors may not altogether dethrone the statist world order, they are introducing a "system of global governance . . . in which states will continue to be sovereign, but sovereignty will be much more conditional than before." In particular, a growing global civil society can hold states domestically accountable to their citizens, and international bodies such as the United Nations can facilitate state cooperation and ensure that governments fulfil their commitments to the world community. The end of the Cold War has indeed marked the emergence of a "new world order" - one in which the rise of transnational actors is of ever-increasing importance. <fnote>Kaldor p584 </fnote>
