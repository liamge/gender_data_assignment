<heading>Referral information Source of referral and a summary of key information</heading>Mr , with a 30-year history of CLL (Stage C), had had a three-day history of insomnia with associated low mood, shortness of breath and swollen legs. He went to the haematology department who advised him to go to A&E where he was subsequently admitted on . <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background. The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading><heading>Presenting complaint:</heading>Three-day history of insomnia with low mood, shortness of breath and swollen legs. <heading>History of presenting complaint:</heading>Mr  had been feeling 'depressed' for the past month, with a three-day history of insomnia. He can currently only walk a few steps on the flat before getting short of breath, this sudden change occurred about one week prior to admission. Prior to this he had been getting progressively short of breath over the last 6 months. He has had problems with his legs swelling in the past, but this had resolved. The current leg oedema started about a month ago and has progressively worsened. Mr  does suffer with orthopneoa and needs 4 pillows at night time to sleep comfortably, he doesn't suffer from PND, chest pain, intermittent claudication. He has also reported recent feelings of intermittent palpitations. Has had a productive cough for the last 4 years, which was white, but has recently changed to brown sputum. He doesn't suffer from any pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis or wheeze. He has been more constipated recently and has lost about 4 - 5 stones in the last 2 years. He is regularly reviewed by a dietician who prescribes food supplements (Pro-CalÂ®). In addition, he bruises very easily (caused by CLL and low platelet count) and recently has been getting very intolerant to heat. <heading>Past medical history:</heading><list>No history of asthma, MI, CVA, diabetes, RF, epilepsy 1946 - peritonitis following ruptured appendix1975 - diagnosed with CLL (currently stage C), associated spleno- and hepatomegaly and pancytopaenia1975 - blind in right eye1985 - cataract left eyeAtrial fibrillation Suffers with back and rib pain</list><heading>Family history:</heading>Nil of note <heading>Drug history and allergies:</heading>NKDA <list><heading>Management of CLL:</heading>Vigam i.v. injection every 3/52 - infection prevention (normal immunoglobulin)Blood transfusion every 6/52He is put on a course of steroids for 10 days in between his blood transfusion dates (reduce haemolysis risk)</list><list>Codeine phosphate 60mg PO QDS - opioid analgesicParacetamol 1g - non-opioid analgesicTemazepam 10mg nocte - short-acting hypnotic, used to treat insomnia </list><heading>Social history:</heading>He retired at 65, during the latter part of his working life he was self-employed and owned two DIY shops Lives with his wife in a house in  They have adapted the house, building a toilet downstairs so that he doesn't have to climb the stairs Has a son and a daughter who both live near-by Teetotal - CLL medication dictates he should not drink Ex-smoker, gave up 60 years ago after the war, started at the age of 14 on 40/day (18 pack year history) <heading>Systems review:</heading>Gastrointestinal - nil of note Neurological - Mr  has not suffered from parasthesiae, faints, fits or funny turns, headaches, weakness or dizziness Locomotor - he does not suffer from joint pain, stiffness, back pain <heading>Analysis of history The most likely single cause of the presentation, other possible causes and reasons for these choices. The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>Heart failure (RHF or CHF), due to the evidence of dyspnoea, orthopnea and peripheral oedema Dyspnoea and general lethargy secondary to anaemia due to his CLL Malnutrition - Mr  has stated that his nutrition is a problem, due to a reduced appetite and receives advice from the dietician. He states he does eat the drinks he is prescribed, which should combat any protein deficits in his body, making this diagnosis less likely. Liver failure due to heptao-splenomegaly Nephrotic syndrome/renal failure Insomnia due to depression coupled with the orthopnea and dyspnoea Hypothyroidism can cause constipation, intolerance of heat and insomnia - evidence of a goitre and thyroid disease need to be assessed on examination. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading>Mr  was a cachexic man sitting comfortably in the chair. His ribs were clearly visible His hands were warm and dry. There was palmar erythema bilaterally and a resting tremour. No evidence of clubbing, peripheral cyanosis, splinter haemorrhages, xanthomata or dupuytren's contracture on his hands. There was extensive bruising on his hands and forearms. Pulse = 115 bpm and irregularly irregular, BP 102/52, temp 37.4 OC, RR = 20, O 2 sats 96% on air Conjunctiva was pale, there was no evidence of jaundice, corneal arcus or xanthelasma in his eyes. No central cyanosis, lymphadenopathy or goitre. JVP raised above 4cm at 45 degrees Bilateral pitting oedema up to knees Mr 's chest, on examination, was symmetrical with significant muscle wasting, revealing his ribs and sternum. <heading>Cardiovascular examination :</heading>Palpation: Apex beat was sustained and non-displaced. No evidence of heaves or thrills. Auscultation: HI + HII + no extra or additional heart sounds. Evidence of a grade 3 pansystolic murmur heard in all 4 areas, loudest at the apex. No carotid bruits <heading>Respiratory examination :</heading>Palpation: Trachea non-deviated, expansion normal Percussion: Dullness to percussion at both lung bases, posteriorly Auscultation: Bilateral expiratory crackles, heard most clearly in the left lower base. Generalised wheeze. <heading>Abdominal examination :</heading>Both the spleen and liver were easily visible when the patient was supine Palpation: Liver was palpable five fingers breadth below the subcostal marginSpleen was palpable to the umbilicusNo other masses felt. Kidneys not palpable. Percussion: Liver was percussed two ICS superiorly. Shifting dullness elicited. Auscultation: No liver or splenic bruits heard. Bowel sounds present. <heading>Neurological examination : </heading>no abnormalities found on gross examination. <heading>Analysis of history and examination Reasons for your choice of the cause of the patient's problem(s) and any other cause that still needs to be considered at this stage</heading>The evidence from the history and examination would indicate that the most likely cause of Mr 's current problems would be: Heart failure (RHF or CHF), this is a likely diagnosis due to dyspnoea, orthopnea and peripheral oedema; as well as, the evidence of a systolic murmur on auscultation, which would add additional strain on the heart; and bilateral basal lung crackles, indicating pulmonary oedema. Anaemia could be an additional complication, exacerbating the heart failure and subsequent dyspnoea, as there was evidence of pallor in the conjunctiva. Liver failure cannot be ruled out due to marked hepatomegaly and ascites. It is less likely to be renal failure; although there was ascites, there was no loin tenderness or palpable kidneys. Again, this diagnosis cannot be ruled out and blood test will help to understand current renal function. In the history, Mr  stated that he had been feeling depressed which can exacerbate current physical problems. Apart from a resting tremor, there was no evidence of thyroid disease on examination, blood results will give the definitive diagnosis. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>Mr  has a number of health problems, which need to be managed in a co-ordinated fashion to ensure that he receives the best possible care. He appears to understand his CLL very well and the treatment he has for this and why he has it. His main complaint for this admission is his insomnia and rapid degeneration of his breathing. Psychologically he states that he is low in mood, this will need to be addressed, as any feelings of depression will exacerbate his physical condition, which is already a delicate one. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management.

It was also shown to be an effective alternative for patients who were intolerant to ACE inhibitors [4,5]. <heading>(-blockers :</heading>There has been strong evidence that adding a -blocker with an ACE inhibitor decreased mortality and hospital admission in symptomatic people with heart failure of any NYHA class [6,7]. <heading>Digoxin :</heading>One large RCT showed that people receiving diuretics, ACE inhibitors and digoxin had reduced levels of admission to hospital due to worsening heart failure at 37 months compared with placebo, but there was no significant difference in mortality rates [8]. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>Mr  is a very complicated patient with many different health problems. Due to space limitation, I will focus on heart failure and CLL. <heading>Heart failure :</heading><heading>Definition :</heading>Heart failure is the inability of the heart to meet the demands of the body with normal perfusion pressures. It is characterised clinically by dyspnoea, effort intolerance, fluid retention, and poor survival. Heart failure can be due to systolic or diastolic dysfunction and is associated with elevated levels of brain natiuretic peptide (BNP) and pro-NT BNP [9,10]. <heading>Incidence and prevalence :</heading>U.S. and European studies have shown an incidence rate [11]: <table/>Fewer than 15% of people with heart failure under 65 years have normal systolic function, whereas the prevalence is about 40% in people over 65 years [12]. <heading>Aetiology and risk factors :</heading>The commonest cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease; other causes include hypertension, cardiomyopathy and valvular heart disease [9]. Risk factors include LVH, cigarette smoking, hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes. <heading>Prognosis :</heading>The 5-year mortality rate ranges from 26 - 75% [10]. Re-admission rates of 16% within 6 months of first admission have been recorded. The most common cause of death is due to ventricular arrhythmias and is responsible for 25 - 50% of all deaths [9]. <heading>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) :</heading>CLL is the uncontrolled proliferation and accumulation of mature B lymphocytes. The symptoms of the disease are due to bone marrow failure and subsequent immunosuppression. Patients with CLL suffer from anaemia, infection and bleeding, due to pancytopaenia. The disease can normally be kept under control for about 10 years. Patients can often die from infection or it can evolve into a high-grade large-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 'Richter's transformation', which is more aggressive and difficult to treat. There are two different staging classifications (helps with prognosis), Mr 's classification is using the Rai staging system: <table/>*Progression = weight loss, fatigue, massive organomegaly and a rapidly increasing lymphocyte count. Diagnosis is made by evidence of small lymphocytes on blood film and is confirmed by immunophenotyping, showing co-expression of CD5 and CD19 antigen [13]. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading>CCF (presentations, management and evidence-based trials for treatment of heart failure); echocardiograms (what are they used for, what is measured and why, how are they done); CLL (what is it, how is it managed).
