<heading>A general background of the existing machine</heading>The tensile testing machine as described by Marsh was designed to investigate the mechanical properties of whiskers and other small crystals or similar specimens. <heading>A brief description of the working</heading>The specimen is first mounted by gluing and clamping. The X-Y stage is then used to adjust the length of the specimen and to align the jaws of the specimen holder and to clamp the stage. The extension detector is zeroed and a load is applied by the torsion balance by adjusting the micrometer drive to twist the wire. The optical gauge is nulled until the detector reads zero. This is done using the fine adjustment levers provided. By nulling of the optical gauge the tensile force acting on the specimen can be calculated which is nothing but the product of the twist on the wire and apparent stiffness of the specimen holder. The displacement of the nulling micrometer gives the extension in the specimen. <heading>The specifications of the existing machine are:</heading><list>Minimum specimen cross section:  FORMULA Maximum specimen cross section:  FORMULA Maximum specimen length: 15mmMinimum specimen length:0.5mmMaximum tensile strength:400gfMinimum tensile strength:1mgfMachine repeatability:  FORMULA </list><heading>Functionality of the various components</heading><heading>a) The Torsion balance</heading>The torsion balance as shown in the figure consists of a flat base 15 and a top plate 16 attached by a semi circular tubular column 17. The micrometer 18 connected to the push rod 19 and arm 1 rotates a tube 20. This tube is pivoted between vee blocks 21 as a result causes the rotation of the torsion wire 2 from the top. The beam 3 as seen in the figure rotates freely and is hinged to a cross-spring pivot 22, 23, to which a torsion wire is attached at the boss 24. Hence the rotation of the micrometer head applies the tensile force on the specimen at 13. Coarse zeroing is provided by the ball ended screw at end of arm 1 and fine zeroing being provided by the extension detector system. <picture/>The good design features of the torsion balance are as follows: The simplicity and stability over a wide range coverage using interchangeable torsion wires makes the torsion balance ideal for this application. The use of a kinematic screw mechanism ensures that there is accurate reproducibility in its actions. The idea of using end rods with large diameter was a good design idea as it compensates for errors due to replacing of torsion wires. <heading>b) The extension detector</heading>The mirror system: The system essentially consists of two mirrors which receive light from an autocollimating telescope. When the two mirrors 5 and 6 are at 45° to each other they reflect the light as shown in the figure 2 to form an image of the specimen 7 at 8. The advantages of using such a setup are as follows: It increases the sensitivity because it involves multiples reflections as compared to a simple optical system. The null condition in this case is affected by only 2 of the 18 degrees of freedom the system possesses. The arrangement of the mirrors at 45° position ensures that the telescope axis has no longer to be in the plane normal to the mirrors 5 and 6. Hence it can be placed at an angle more suitable for the user and also more convenient for the suspensions and linkages. The sensitivity is doubled and in this systems case to 1Å. The telescope: To see the diffractions effects clearly, a×50 eye piece is used and the resulting setting accuracy is about 4 times that expected from normal Rayleigh criterion. The setup is illustrated in the figure above. <picture/>The good design features noticed in the setup are as follows: The lamp house which illuminates the specimen is mounted outside the main box. In doing this the temperature fluctuations are eliminated. The design of the sliding specimen holder in its mounting tube and mounting tube carrying the mirror enables three perpendicular centering and focusing motions required by the specimen. This is a very simple yet very effective way. The use of a simple achromatic lens eliminates any awkward reflections from the lens faces. <heading>c) The lever Mechanism</heading>The lever mechanism used in the system achieves a reduction ratio 100:1 from the micrometer to the specimen. This is achieved in two stages. Firstly the movement of the micrometer causes the movement of the lever about its single strip flexure pivot 49 as illustrated in the figure. This provides an instantaneous 25 fold reduction at the connecting strap 50. There is further reduction at lever 51 pivoted at 52 to give a total hundred fold reduction at the grip 14. This smooth action of the lever is helped by the use of steel balls pressed on the underside of the levers and sliding over the ground, chromium- plated surface of plate 11. <picture/>The good design features noticed are as follows: In order to make the centre of rotation coincide with the centre of gravity a clamp is mounted on the movable tube and if two-dimensional movement is required, the tube can be journaled in a rotating rod as indicated by the 'ghost' lines. This system has been used in the micro-tensile testing machine shown above. <picture/>The advantages of using single strip flexure joints are as follows: (i) The single strip hinge is very much simpler; (ii) The single strip hinge usually employs much shorter strips so that various errors particularly shift and displacement angles due to rotation are reduced. (iii) In addition to the effect described above the shift displacement angle is very small for the single strip hinge. (iv) The errors for which the single strip hinge is inferior are often small or may be eliminated for practical purposes by suitable arrangements of the hinge strip. <heading>d) The traveling microscope</heading>The microscope is held to the micrometer by means of a 'pot' magnet 64 which also provides a hard surface for the micrometer ball end. When a specimen is to be mounted the microscope is just pushed away by hand from the vicinity and of the grips and remains so until pushed back to join the micrometer. The good design features are as follows: The use of the magnet has two advantages firstly providing a hard surface and that it operates only when in contact with the micrometer. This is a simple yet ingenious design which must be credited. For a travelling microscope a simple hinge is required. The normal solution might have been to use a rod in a vee block, but the use of a simple single strip hinge was much more compact and rather simpler to construct in this position Another example is the mirror mount pivoted on a single strip hinge. This hinge also provides the spring restraint required by the adjusting screw and replaces a hole; slot and plane mount with its balls and spring system. Where angles less than about 30° are involved this type of use might be more widespread. <heading>Calibration and errors</heading>The torsion balance was calibrated by mounting on its side and using a scale pan and weights. The lever system used in the device was calibrated in two ways. In the first method the lever arms were measured accurately using universal measuring machine which has resolution of  FORMULA . The second method makes use of the overall lever ratio by joining the grips and balancing large drum, micrometer movements with the coarse strain micrometer, using the extension detector as a nulling device. <heading>The drawbacks of the tensile testing machine as designed by D.M. Marsh</heading>The tensile testing machine designed by Marsh is extremely accurate and has proved itself over a number of decades. However there were a few drawbacks or limitations that could be overcome. They are as follows: A number of studies have shown it is more economical to build equipment made of simple components which are easy to modify, rather than strive to create a universal all-encompassing piece of equipment. Flexure error causes variations in lever arm lengths and hence lever ratios. This factor is not helped by the large reduction ratio of 100:1 between the drum micrometer and the specimen. There is no means to testing the sample in a controlled atmosphere as is required in many cases. The entire method of measuring the cross sectional area of the specimen is rather crude and is bound to give errors. The present machine is completely manual there are no means of automated strain recordings. Since the specimen is held in position by glue there is always the danger of the specimen being bent due to uneven heating or melting of the glue. Hence more attention should have been paid to the design of specimen supports. Given all due to credit for the design with technology available at that time there was no effort made to design a device to record the results. This is vital to observe occurrences and recording noticeable similarities and differences. <heading>The following describes the new and improved version of the existing machine</heading>With regard to its properties it is quite similar to the machine designed by Marsh and can be structurally compared to it in many aspects. However in this device the combination of an atomic force microscope and an accurate mechanical testing machine provides unique yet efficient way to study the deformation mechanisms of a wide range of materials as they are incrementally strained. Making use of well controlled states of stress and strain to a material sample and observing the deformation of the sample with nanometer resolution, the nanomechanics of the material can be compared to the macroscopic stress strain behavior. The knowledge thus gained would be very useful in the design of such materials. <heading>Requirements of the improved machine</heading>There are two basic requirements for instrumentation is the deformation of the sample in a controlled manner and an accurate means of measuring it. A controlled deformation speed must be achieved in order to measure the deformation. The other requirement being to measure the test sample from the cross head movement of the tensile testing machine and this measurement can also be made using three dimensional pictures using the improved technology available. <heading>Instrumentation</heading><heading>Atomic force microscope:</heading>An atomic force microscope is chosen because it is commercially available and it makes design sense to design a system around a commercially available system. The use of an AFM makes sense because it gives the user the ability to visualize the surface of the specimen for close inspection a feature which was not available with Marsh's machine. Besides an AFM has several advantages listed below. Compared with Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM), the AFM provides extraordinary topographic contrast, direct height measurements and unobscured views of surface features (no coating is necessary). Compared with Transmission Electron Microscopes, 3-dimensional AFM images are obtained without expensive sample preparation and yield far more complete information than the 2-dimensional profiles available from cross-sectioned samples. Compared with Optical Interferometric Microscopes (Optical Profilers), the AFM provides unambiguous measurement of step heights, independent of reflectivity differences between materials. The AFM works by a tiny stylus which gently contacts the specimen. As the XYZ translator scans either the specimen or the stylus horizontally in a raster pattern (XY), the stylus rides up and down the surface hills and valleys. The deflection of the stylus is registered by the laser/photodiode sensor and the XYZ translator adjusts stylus or specimen (depending on microscope) up or down (Z) to restore the stylus to its original orientation. The computer stores the vertical position at each point and assembles the image. <heading>Load Measurement</heading>The torsion balance was used in Marsh's machine for load application because of its simplicity, stability and large range coverage. However the new improved version used a Load cell for load application. This is because load cells with their excellent stiffness minimises errors while measuring strain. The tensile testing machine makes use of three different piezoelectric load cells 25N, 250N and 4.4 KN. This results in a load range varying from 0-25N with a resolution of 125mN, a mid range of 0-250N with a resolution of 1.25N and a high range of (0-4.4kN) with a resolution of 22N. These loads cells are connected to a data acquisition system. <heading>Motor and sensor</heading>The use of a motor and sensor enables to keep the sample stationary with respect to the AFM probe and also unlike Marsh's machine it facilitates the same area to be scanned rapidly at every measurement. A stepped motor with an internal planetary gear head combination with a small pitch ball screw is used. This provides 3.8Nm of torque required to generate a maximum tensile force of 4.4kN. However to reduce the drive torque and enable to scan the specimen in a torque free state with motor turned of and eliminate vibration from the servo system a 80:1 gear box system is provided. <heading>Bearings and Ball screw</heading>Bearing in mind the space constraints and requirement for the machine's centre of stiffness to be as close to the plane of the tensile test as possible the structural loop is so designed such that parasitic angular motions are reduced. The entire setup of the bearings and ball screw are shown in the figure below <picture/><heading>Specimen support</heading>The scanning of thin films requires a hard backing material underneath the specimen to prevent unreliable AFM images. This is mainly dude to the fact that the stretched material acts as a sensor itself which amplifies ambient vibrations. A sample support is provided to give reliable backing as the sample thickness decreases in width and thickness. This support is designed to adjustable in height with sufficient stiffness in all directions. A flexure based support is used for this purpose which allows a vertical adjustment of 1.5mm as shown in the fig below <picture/><heading>Control System</heading>This is a great improvement over the earlier machine which lacked a control unit and was completely manual. This consists of two data acquisition cards that are connected to a computer. One card is used to create square wave signals to drive the stepper motor and to provide location and direction of motion for the slides. The other card is used to digitize the analog signals from the load cells as well as the digital signals from the end switches, which serve for setup of the machine as well as safety of the device. <heading>User Interface</heading>In the earlier machine there was no means of obtaining real time feed back or recording the results. The graphical user interface provides control over all aspects of the machine. The application software typically used for this purpose is LabVIEW. Once the setup is completed the user can conduct experiments and get real time feedback by operating the system in various modes.
