<abstract><heading>Summary</heading>In this report a first order plus deadtime system is analysed under different parameters and control methods. In section 2.1 analogue control is considered. The effects of system frequency and controller gain on system stability are analysed. A proportional only controller is used to create a system which oscillated continuously, and the system value after  FORMULA  is calculated using the final value theorem. Discrete control is considered in 2.2. A proportional controller with zero-order hold is designed. Using values obtained in 2.1, the final value of this system is calculated using the Z-transform final value theorem. Comparisons are drawn with its analogue counterpart. In part 2.3 Ziegler Nichols design values are used to design a PID controller. It is discretised using backward differencing and a Dahlin controller is designed; comparisons are drawn between the two. In section 3 controllers discussed previously are simulated using the 'Sampled Data System'. Performance and characteristics are compared and examined. Conclusions drawn are as follows; Overshoot, oscillations and a large settling time are characteristics of the proportional only controller. The PID control significantly reduced the settling time given by a proportional only controller. The Dahlin controller removes the oscillations seen in the PID controller. </abstract><heading>1.

Computer Simulation</heading><heading>3.1</heading><table/>The graphs above represent the characteristics of the first order plus deadtime process using a proportional only discrete controller. In order to make the system oscillate continuously the value of  FORMULA  is used (as calculated in 2.2a). The output shown above in response to a step input agrees with prior calculations. Using  FORMULA  as calculated in 2.1a the following results are obtained; <figure/><figure/><table/>The system settles to a value of 0.8 after the step input. In 2.2b the final value theorem gave  FORMULA  which is consistent with the result of the simulation. The overshoot and oscillations are characteristics of the proportional only controller and are clear in the results. <heading>3.2 </heading><figure/><figure/><table/>Using the parameters found in 2.3, illustrated above is the output of a PID controller with Ziegler Nichols settings subjected to a step input. The results show an unstable oscillation. Experimenting with  FORMULA  leads to a more acceptable output when  FORMULA . <figure/><figure/><table/>Comparing this result to that obtained in the case of a proportional only controller there is a significant reduction in settling time. <heading>3.3</heading><figure/><figure/><table/>The characteristics above are obtained using a Dahlin controller with the values calculated in 2.4. The time constant  FORMULA  can be confirmed against the time it takes for the output to reach 63% of its final value after deadtime has elapsed. Comparing these results with the PID controller it is clear the Dahlin controller removes the oscillations, however it takes longer to reach the final value (settling time can be sped-up by increasing Q). <heading>Conclusions</heading>Overshoot, oscillations, steady state error and a large settling time are characteristics of the proportional only controller. The PID control significantly reduced the settling time and removes steady state error given by a proportional only controller. The Dahlin controller removes the oscillations seen in the PID controller. At a steady state gain  FORMULA , a pure time delay of 1s and a time constant of 4.64s a proportional only analogue control loop will continuously oscillate at  FORMULA  and after an applied step increase will have a final value of ~0.8V. At a steady state gain  FORMULA , a pure time delay of 1s and a time constant of 4.64s a proportional only discrete control loop will have a maximum value for controller stability of  FORMULA  and step response final value of ~0.8V.
