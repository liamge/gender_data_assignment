The concept of a female warrior seems to be a contradiction in terms, yet female warriors have existed in reality since the "classical myths of the Amazons, in the ancient aristocratic women fighters of Britain's warrior Queen Boadicea and in the pre-colonial female regiments of Dahomey, West Africa". One may not even need to resort to history to recall that women today, are equally capable of being militants as well as perpetrators, as evident in the incident when male Iraqi prisoners were sexually tortured by female guards in 2003. In this incident, the much greater outcry in reaction to a woman's involvement as compared to her male comrades' involvement indicates the existing "naturalization of men as perpetrators..." and perception of women as non-aggressive entities, often carrying the burden of a victimhood mentality. <fnote>Sheila Meintjes, "War and Post War shifts in Gender Relations", in Sheila Meintjes, Anu Pillay and Meredeth Turshen, eds., The Aftermath: Women in Post Conflict Transformation (New York: Zed Books Ltd, 2001), p. 63. </fnote><fnote>Miranda Alison, "Wartime Sexual Violence: Women's Human Rights and Questions of Masculinity", Review of International Studies, 33 (2007), p. 76. </fnote><fnote>Ibid., p. 76. </fnote>The dominant image of women in the iconography of war has always been that of an "eternal victim, passive and without agency, an outsider to the battlefront". While women are primarily victims in wartime atrocities and violence, it is crucial that we acknowledge the complexity and multiplicity of women's experiences in conflicts. In midst of their victimhood, women are often pushed to take on greater roles and responsibilities within the home and beyond. Hence, the crux of the essay is to transcend stereotypes of women's non-agency in wars by adopting a post-modern and social constructivist perspective towards this issue. <fnote>Rita Manchanda, "Ambivalent Gains in South Asian Conflicts", in Sheila Meintjes, Anu Pillay and Meredeth Turshen, eds., The Aftermath: Women in Post Conflict Transformation (New York: Zed Books Ltd, 2001), p. 99. </fnote><heading>Argumentative Parameters</heading>With the aim of transcending stereotyped representations to reflect reality, the essay is stringed together by the thematic concept of the "ambivalent empowerment"  of women in the context of ethnic conflicts. Coined by Darini Rajasingham-Senanayake, the term "ambivalent empowerment" aptly describes women's agency during ethnic conflicts and yet questions the extent of this empowerment in post-conflict situations. <fnote>Darini Rajasingham-Senanayake, 'Ambivalent Empowerment: The Tragedy of Tamil Women in Conflict', in Rita Manchanda, eds., Women, War and Peace in South Asia: Beyond Victimhood to Agency (New Delhi: Sage, 2001), p. 113. </fnote><fnote>Ibid., p. 113. </fnote>The first section of the essay will acknowledge and examine the issue of women's agency and empowerment in ethnic conflicts. It will acknowledge women as victims and further transcend that stereotype by providing a critical analysis of the other roles that women have manifested in ethnic conflicts - mothers, militants, perpetrators and peacemakers. The latter part of the essay will then critically assess the extent to which this empowerment endures into post-conflict situations. Following the acceptance of women's diverse roles in conflict, comes about the debate of how long such roles will persist after peace returns and its place during post-conflict reconstruction. More importantly, its implications for gender studies are paramount; it will provide new insight for feminist accounts of women's agency in conflicts. By casting women's roles in a different light will also shed light on how women identify themselves. <fnote>Codou Bop, "Women in Conflicts: Their Gains and Their Losses", in Sheila Meintjes, Anu Pillay and Meredeth Turshen, eds., The Aftermath: Women in Post Conflict Transformation (New York: Zed Books Ltd, 2001), p.21. </fnote><heading>Contextual Framework</heading>Upon establishing the concerns of the essay, it is important to examine those thematic issues within the context of warfare or political conflict. Different kinds of wars permit different kinds of female participation and women's lives are affected in a myriad of ways by the diverse outcomes of wars, hence each war or conflict process is an ambivalent process for women; "women are neither simply victimised nor empowered by war; their experiences are more complicated". <fnote>Wenona Giles, "Introduction", in Wenona Giles, Malathi de Alwis, Edith Klein, Neluka Silva with Maja Korač, Djurdja Knežević and Žarana Papić, eds., Feminists Under Fire: Exchanges Across War Zones (Toronto: Between the Lines: 2003), p.1. </fnote>More specifically, the essay examines women's agency within the context of ethnic conflicts. The term "ethnic conflict" is often used loosely to describe a wide range of interstate conflicts that are in fact not ethnic in nature. It is vital that we set the definitional boundaries for this ideologically loaded term. Beginning from the roots of the term, the word "ethnic" is related to the concept of an "ethnic community" of which Anthony Smith regards as "a named human population with a myth of common ancestry, shared memories and cultural elements; a link with a historic territory or homeland; and a measure of solidarity". Extending this definition, "ethnic conflict" refers to a "dispute about important political, economic, social, cultural or territorial issues between two or more ethnic communities".  <fnote>. Anthony D. Smith, The Ethnic Origins of Nations (Oxford : Basil Blackwell, 1986), p. 24, quoted by Michael E. Brown, Causes and Implications of Ethnic Conflict (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 4. </fnote><fnote>. Ibid., p. 4. </fnote>Ethnic conflicts provide one of the best contexts to examine the correlation between gender and ethnicity because these situational fault lines coincide with where "ethnic and political boundaries have continually shifted and flowed", enabling one to analyze how and when women have situated or shifted their gender, ethnic or national identities, taking on or shedding diverse roles and responsibilities over time and place. Furthermore, the nature of ethnic conflicts take place within the state, in which homes and families constitute the battlefield hence violence is thus "privatised" with more civilians being drawn into conflict; blurring the boundaries between active belligerents and passive victims. Concomitantly, the stereotype of "aggressive men and pacifist women"  can be transcended. With that, the essay hopes to cover sufficient scope without losing depth by examining three contemporary case studies, namely, the ethnic conflicts in Rwanda, former Yugoslavia and Sri Lanka. <fnote>Cynthia Cockburn, The Space between Us: Negotiating Gender and National Identities in Conflict (New York: Zed Books Ltd, 1998), p.27. </fnote><fnote>Miranda Alison, "Women as Agents of Political Violence: Gendering Security", Security Dialogue, 35 (2004), p. 452. </fnote>In the case of Rwanda, the ethnic genocide that ruptured in 1994 was a result of conflicts between two dominant ethnic groups; Tutsis and Hutus. While the German and Belgian colonial legacy introduced and reinforced notions of race and ethnicity, such notions were further politicised by each respective group as ethnicity became wrapped in the rhetoric of nationalism and power. The period leading up to the genocide followed a serious of economic crises such as the structural adjustment policies by the World Bank in 1990. Political crises also accompanied economic ones; such as the Rwandan Civil War in 1990 and the assassination of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana. In view of all these, the state was facing serious threats to its survival and by extension; the dominant Hutu elites began to perceive the Tutsis as a dominant ethnic threat. This marked the beginning of a nation-wide massacre against the Tutsis. Similarly, the genocides within the former Yugoslavia territories also occurred due to ethnic incompatibilities within the region. The Yugoslav wars were a series of violent conflicts in the territories of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) that took place between 1991 and 2001. The former Yugoslavia composed of diverse ethnic and religious groups that had been historical rivals including the Serbs (Orthodox Christians), Croats (Catholics) and ethnic Albanians (Muslims). The conflict had its roots in the multi-ethnic make up and the political and demographic demonization of the Serbs. Fundamental to the tensions was the different conceptions for the new state; the Croats and other ethnic minorities favoured federalism while the Serbs argued for greater unity under a Serbian Kingdom. These tensions often erupted into open conflicts, resulting in a repressive regime dominated by the Serb security structure. Closely related to the above examples, ethnicity forms the basis of conflicts in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has an ethnically diverse population, with about 74.6% of the population as Sinhalese, 12.6% Sri Lankan Tamil, 7.4% Muslim and 5.5% Indian Tamil, with other small minorities. In many ways, the history of British colonialism may have also contributed to the rise of ethnic consciousness however the further polarization and politicization of the ethnic groups came about with geopolitical demands and power struggles. Unlike the other two case studies, the Sri Lankan civil war is still an ongoing conflict that started since 1983, predominantly between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a secessionist group which aspires for an independent state named Tamil Eelam in the North and East of the island. <fnote>Alison, "Women as Agents of Political Violence: Gendering Security", p. 449. </fnote>These three case studies are geopolitically diverse enough to encapsulate unique experiences from three different regions of the world and yet conceptually similar to entail a comparative study of women's agency across time and space. All three conflicts can be viewed as being ethno-nationalist in nature and all reveal a similar theme of women victimhood during those wars. Keeping the focus on the notion of women's agency and empowerment, the essay will merely provide the contextual background of each ethnic conflict to the extent that is sufficient as a backdrop to analyze how women fought and transcended gender norms by taking on new challenges and responsibilities in each ethnic conflict. <heading>Disempowerment Discourses</heading>In order to transcend stereotypes, we often have to understand how these stereotypes are formed and sustained. As Cynthia Cockburn asserted rightly, "we cannot let traditionalist images of women and men in these wars pass unquestioned, any more than we can accept primordial explanations of the violence itself". State-sanctioned images of non-combatant women in supportive wartime roles reflect, rather than confront, traditional conceptualizations of 'legitimate knowledge' and ways of knowing. The stereotypical image of women as passive victims in conflicts is a result of scholarly short-sightedness set within a gender-bias academic context. <fnote>Cockburn, The Space between Us: Negotiating Gender and National Identities in Conflict, p.13. </fnote><fnote>Katrina Lee Koo, "Confronting a Disciplinary Blindness: Women, War and Rape in the International Politics of Security", Australian Journal of Political Science, 37 (2002), p. 525. </fnote>Firstly, we have to confront a disciplinary blindness in war studies which adhere to an essentialist and realist way of approaching women's agency in conflicts. Much of the debate surrounding the inclusion of women in the study of international politics, particularly in reflections of war, promotes passive representation through an essentialist approach. Essentialism is a dangerous theoretical concept as it operates through stereotypes and defines a certain relation between men and women. It is a relation of male dominance which "fix identity in eternal dualisms: woman victim, male warrior..." that in turns sustains gender bias and inequality. Furthermore, war studies often adopt international relations theories that adhere to realism. As an entrenched ideology, realism is problematic for women as it "traps them in traditionally defined and carefully constructed gendered roles" upon which "the smooth functioning of realist international relations, as a discipline, depends". Effectively, women as passive victims are made invisible and silenced by the realist discourse primarily because their experiences are deemed to function within the private realm. Furthermore, the multiple roles women play in ethnic conflicts are simply not recognised in a "discourse that offers no political legitimacy to women located, or proclaiming knowledge, outside of the defined norms, and respects only those who reify existing traditions". <fnote>Ibid., p. 525. </fnote><fnote>Cynthia Cockburn, The Space between Us: Negotiating Gender and National Identities in Conflict, p.13. </fnote><fnote>Koo, "Confronting a Disciplinary Blindness: Women, War and Rape in the International Politics of Security", p. 526. </fnote><fnote>Ibid., p. 531. </fnote><fnote>Ibid., p. 526. </fnote>Secondly, human rights discourses and humanitarian interventions have ironically undermined women's non-victim role in conflicts. They often frame women largely as victims of war, requiring (male) protection, and as the sole victims of sexual violence. As Lloyd reiterated rightly, human rights discourses often universalises women and "abstracts from the structural determinations that position diverse groups of women in fundamentally inegalitarian way". All these overriding assumptions become problematic when we examine contemporary examples of victimization, when women are also agents of violence while men become the victims of sexual abuse. <fnote>Miranda Alison, "Wartime Sexual Violence: Women's Human Rights and Questions of Masculinity", p. 84. </fnote><fnote>Lloyd, 'Democratizing Potential', quoted by Alison, "Wartime Sexual Violence: Women's Human Rights and Questions of Masculinity", p. 84. </fnote>Furthermore, the patriarchal arrangement in society is the most established hierarchy throughout history. Even the most basic analysis of conflict and post-conflict processes reveals significant gender divisions that are so obvious that they end up being largely overlooked - because it is taken for granted that it is "men who fight, men who lead troops or guerrilla movements, men who negotiate peace, men who wear blue helmets, and men who head UN agencies". Such assumptions of what men do or what women do not do are so ingrained in society that such gender norms are often unquestioned. Therefore, women have been left out in history because we have often conceived of history in male centred terms. Reinforcing societal stereotypes, the media often puts women suffering at the forefront of the cover of conflicts which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. <fnote>Lori Handrahan, "Conflict, Gender, Ethnicity and Post-Conflict Reconstruction", Security Dialogue, 35 (2004) p. 432. </fnote>In all, there are many traditional theories that pose methodological barriers to recognising women's full agency in ethnic conflicts - silencing them as a result. As a consequence, women are more likely to suffer from being victims of cultural norms as they have to collectively "shoulder a burden of being (inevitable) victims of the violence the system has created".  <fnote>Vidyamali Samarasinghe, "Soldiers, Housewives and Peace makers: Ethnic Conflict and Gender in Sri Lanka", Ethnic Studies Report, 14 (1996), p. 211. </fnote><heading>Empowering Women with an "Empowerment Discourse"</heading>Moving away from essentialist conceptions of women's agency in conflicts, it is crucial to begin by acknowledging the widespread victimhood of women in ethnic conflicts. Following on, we can then transcend this stereotype and explore the opportunities and possibilities present in conflicts for women to take on new and unconventional roles. This is epitomised in Sri Lanka, when Tamil women fleeing conflict realised that the "spatial exigencies of camp life produced an erosion of the caste hierarchies" which ironically empowered them to assume men's former tasks and gain a degree of economic and political independence. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, Medica Zenica became a centre for traumatised displaced women and it was run by Bosnian women physicians that provided therapy to more than 2,000 women. Furthermore, In Rwanda, after the conflict, women made up an estimated 55% of the population and headed 33% of families. All these examples illustrate that ethnic conflicts may empower women when traditional structures of domination are shaken, enabling women to take on new roles in reconfigured political space. It is important to trace such patterns of empowerment in order to recognise the positive changes to women's roles and lives wrought in conflict.  <fnote>Meintjes, "War and Post War Shifts in Gender Relations", p. 68. </fnote><fnote>Nancy Farwell, "War Rape New conceptualizations and Responses", Affilia, 19 (2004), p.398. </fnote><fnote>"Meintjes, "War and Post War Shifts in Gender Relations", p. 68. </fnote><fnote>Darini Rajasingham-Senanayake, "Ambivalent Empowerment: The Tragedy of Women in Conflict", p. 107. </fnote><heading>I. Acknowledging Victimhood </heading>Undeniably, facts and figures from countless reports have illustrated the extensive sufferings of women during ethnic conflicts. The nature of victimization and the identities of the perpetrators and victims are both complex and diverse and the most documented one is of sexual violence and abuse.  <fnote>Caroline O.N. Moser and Fiona C. Clark, "Introduction", in Caroline O.N. Moser and Fiona C. Clark, eds., Victims, Perpetrators or Actors? Gender, Armed Conflict and Political Violence. London: Zed Books Ltd, 2001, p. 8. </fnote>According to a European Union investigation, approximately 20,000 girls and women suffered rape in 1992 in Bosnia alone while the United Nations Commission of Experts on Yugoslavia affirmed that the "vast majority of the victims are Bosnian Muslims and the great majority of the alleged perpetrators are Bosnian Serbs". In striking similarity, Tutsi women were raped by Hutu men on a genocide mission to "destroy all Tutsi as a social group" during the Rwandan genocide. The numbers of Tutsi women raped were estimated to be between 250 000 and 500 000.  <fnote>Elisabeth Jean Wood, "Sexual Violence during War: Explaining Variation", New York University: Santa Fe Institute, April 2004 (Article presented at Conflict and Violence Conference at Yale University, April 30-May 1, 2004), p. 5. </fnote><fnote>Meredeth Turshen, "The Political Economy of Rape", in Caroline O.N. Moser and Fiona C. Clark, eds., Victims, Perpetrators or Actors? Gender, Armed Conflict and Political Violence (London, Zed Books Ltd, 2001), p. 62. </fnote><fnote>Lisa Sharlach, "Gender and Genocide in Rwanda: Women as Agents and Objects of Genocide", Journal of Genocide Research, 1 (1999), p. 393. </fnote>In contrast to these two cases, sexual violence in Sri Lanka is generally instigated by government forces against women associated with a secessionist insurgency. While the statistics are generally less, displaced Tamil women and girls also face "threats of sexual assault, including gang rape and rape with foreign objects..." at checkpoints by police or security forces on the premise that they are members of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. <fnote>Wood, "Sexual Violence during War: Explaining Variation", p. 9. </fnote>In many cases, victimisation continues on even in post conflict situations. The overwhelming numbers of displaced widowed women in Sri Lanka and the flow of refugees from occupied territories in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are sufficient to assert the dire predicaments of women in post conflict situations. For instance, after the genocide in Rwanda, inheritance laws barred surviving women from accessing the property of their dead male family members unless they had been explicitly named as beneficiaries. As a result, thousands were left with no legal claim to their homes and land. Many women, including rape victims may have experienced a worse fate - death- befall on their family members or witnessed their homes and communities destroyed with little prospect of an end to the hostility and conflict. Hence victimised women who lived through war and conflict do not fall into a single neat category. Not only do their experiences differ but also their connections to the conflict and these experiences and connections determine their position in the aftermath. <fnote>Adam Jones, "Gender and Ethnic Conflict in Ex-Yugoslavia", Ethnic and Racial Studies, 17(1994), p. 119. </fnote><fnote>Jeanne Ward and Mendy Marsh, "Sexual Violence Against Women and Girls in War and Its Aftermath: Realities, Responses, and Required Resources" (A Briefing Paper Prepared for Symposium on Sexual Violence in Conflict and Beyond, 21-23 June 2006, Brussels), p. 9. </fnote><fnote>Karen Engle, "Feminism and Its (Dis)contents: Criminalizing Wartime Rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina", The American Journal of International Law, 99 (2005), p. 813. </fnote>While we acknowledge that women are often victimised in different ways, it is vital to reiterate that women are not victimised entirely on a gender basis. War crimes against women must be analyzed within the symbolic contexts of the nation and the gender system. Real victimisation becomes symbolic victimisation when women are targeted on ethnic grounds rather than on a gender basis. This is evident in the former Yugoslavia, when Serbian army officers devised the so-called RAM Plan in 1991, which mentions "raping women and children as an efficient and integral tool in the process of ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina". Ethnic violence is then targeted less at women per se, than on women as symbolic ethnic and national boundary-makers. As Ruth Seifert puts it, "the female body is 'a symbolic representation of the body politic' and rape of women is 'the symbolic rape of the body of [the] community". <fnote>Ruth Seifert, "The Second Front, The Logic of Sexual Violence in Wars", Women's Studies International Forum, 19 (1996), p. 35. </fnote><fnote>Inger Skjelsbaek, "Sexual Violence and War: Mapping Out a Complex Relationship", European Journal of International Relations, 7 (2001), p. 220. </fnote><fnote>Ruth Seifert, 'War and Rape: A Preliminary Analysis', quoted by Alison, "Wartime Sexual Violence: Women's Human Rights and Questions of Masculinity", p. 81. </fnote>In this social constructionist perspective, victimisation in ethnic conflicts is not fixated to women on gender grounds rather it is regarded as a "transaction of identities between the perpetrator and the victims"; the perpetrator regardless of sex is masculinised while the victim is conversely feminized. In this light, men can be victims and women may be perpetrators. <fnote>Farwell, "War Rape New conceptualizations and Responses", p.397. </fnote><heading>II. Transcending Victimhood </heading>Reinforcing the arguments proposed above, this section will adopt a post-structuralist approach to examine women's "fractured identities" and multiple roles - as mothers, militants, perpetrators and peace makers. <fnote>Vidyamali Samarasinghe, "Soldiers, Housewives and Peace makers: Ethnic Conflict and Gender in Sri Lanka", Ethnic Studies Report, 14 (1996), p. 204. </fnote>The roles of women as mothers and wives during ethnic conflicts have often been taken for granted and the importance of these responsibilities are often dismissed. It is through understanding women's role in the domestic realm that one can fully encapsulate women's experiences in ethnic conflicts. On a symbolic level, motherhood translates to being reproducers of the boundaries of ethno-national groups. The rise of nationalist ideology in ethno-national conflicts has reinforced this tendency by using mothers as symbols of the nation and reiterating women's responsibility for the "biological and cultural reproduction of the nation". With that, women assert an "active and patriotic womanhood through her role as a mother". Thus, a Serbian Member of Parliament reminded Serbian women of their sacred mission and their national responsibility, "I call upon all Serbian women to give birth to one more son in order to carry out their national debt".  <fnote>Wendy Bracewell, "Women, Motherhood and Contemporary Serbian Nationalism", Women's Studies International Forum, 19 (1996), p. 25. </fnote><fnote>Ibid., p. 25. </fnote><fnote>Maja Korac, "Understanding Ethnic-National Identity and its Meaning - Questions from Women's Experience", Women's Studies International Forum, 19 (1996), p. 136. </fnote>Conversely, women may use the rhetoric of motherhood to stage anti-war or peace protests and as a consequence, overturn simple generations about mothers being either victimised or idealised. This is evident in many parts of former Yugoslavia during 1991 which witnessed the development of motherhood-inspired movements such as "Mothers against the War" movement. More notably, on 2 nd July 1991, there was a mass gathering of mothers in downtown Belgrade "to protest the suffering of sons killed, injured or imprisoned in Slovenia".  <fnote>Carol S. Lilly and Jill A. Irvine, "Negotiating Interests: Women and Nationalism in Serbia and Croatia, 1990-1997", East European Politics and Societies, 16 (2002), p.114. </fnote>As we acknowledge the important roles women play in the domestic sphere which accord them agency, women do play a more direct and active role in the public sphere in relation to the ethnic conflict as either militants or revolutionaries. Ethnic conflicts, especially secessionist struggles may lead to societal changes that draw women into the "public arena of the armed struggle itself". The involvement of female combatants in the Sri Lanka Tamil guerrilla organisation - LTTE - provides the best empirical evidence for this form of direct agency. From the mid-1980s, the LTTE has aggressively recruited women into their fighting cadres and by 1989; the Vituthalai Pulikal Munani (Women's Front of the Liberation Tigers) had its own leadership structure. "Female Tigers" often take on masculinised roles; "they work the supply lines, operate medical support services, do sentry duty and provide fighters for front line battles". Hence, the LTTE struggle in Sri Lanka is a good empirical example of how ethnic conflicts may "empower women to take their place with men". <fnote>Samarasinghe, "Soldiers, Housewives and Peace makers: Ethnic Conflict and Gender in Sri Lanka", p.205. </fnote><fnote>Ibid., p. 213. </fnote><fnote>Miranda Alison, "Cogs in the Wheel? Women in the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam", Civil Wars, 6 (2003), p.38 - 39. </fnote><fnote>Samarasinghe, "Soldiers, Housewives and Peace makers: Ethnic Conflict and Gender in Sri Lanka", p.215. </fnote><fnote>Neloufer de Mel, "Agent or Victim? The Sri Lankan Woman Militant in the Interregnum" in Wenona Giles, Malathi de Alwis, Edith Klein, Neluka Silva with Maja Korač, Djurdja Knežević and Žarana Papić, eds., Feminists Under Fire: Exchanges Across War Zones (Toronto: Between the Lines, 2003), p. 57. </fnote>In a similar light, the ethnic conflicts that have engulfed the regions of the former Yugoslavia during the past decade offer us new perspectives of looking at the roles women play. The story of Delija Štrbaja, a 41 year old mother who enlisted and served for 46 days on the front line of the conflict in Banija, was published in the Serbian Newspapers, Ilustrovana Politika in December 1991 as a form of motivation for all citizens to defend their nation against threat represented by Kosovo Albanians. As the wars continued, the Serbian press often offered numerous real life stories about Serbian women who had volunteered to serve on the front lines of the battle. These articles present real empirical evidence of women's militant role on the frontlines, reinforcing the fact that women were not always passive victims during ethnic conflicts. <fnote>Lilly and Irvine, "Negotiating Interests: Women and Nationalism in Serbia and Croatia, 1990-1997", p. 109. </fnote><fnote>Ibid., p. 120. </fnote>While women may play an assertive role in ethnic conflicts, they may not be military combatants fighting for a worthy cause; rather they could be active perpetrators of inhumane war crimes. Even if female perpetrators constitute a minority few, dismissing the fact that they do exist is to assert women's passivity in wars on an inaccurate empirical basis. The Rwandan genocide presents us with examples of women as agents of political and sexual violence in ethnic conflicts. Lisa Sharlach, who produced a research article on this field of study, highlighted the fact that women, especially Hutu women were "among the political elite most responsible for the genocide".  <fnote>Sharlach, "Gender and Genocide in Rwanda: Women as Agents and Objects of Genocide", p. 387. </fnote>Hutu ethnicity overrode any sense of sisterhood with Tutsi women hence Hutu nuns would hand Tutsi women over to the militia when they sought refuge at churches and Hutu women would turn Tutsi children over to the Interahamwe to be killed, when many Tutsi women left their children under their protection. Moreover, many Rwandan nuns "provided lists of those yet to be killed and even participated in the killings themselves". All these war atrocities came to light when the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) convicted Jean-Paul Akayesu, the first woman ever to be charged with genocide in an international court. Similar charges were brought against former Serb President Biljana Plavšić, for genocide and crimes against humanity. In all, women were rarely viewed as having played a political or military role in the war and this myopic focus of women as only "victims of propaganda machinery" could deflect attention to which women are responsible for the wars as all these empirical evidences suggest.  <fnote>Ibid., p. 392. </fnote><fnote>Sharlach, "Gender and Genocide in Rwanda: Women as Agents and Objects of Genocide", p. 392. </fnote><fnote>Alison, "Wartime Sexual Violence: Women's Human Rights and Questions of Masculinity", p. 89. </fnote><fnote>Engle, "Feminism and Its (Dis)contents: Criminalizing Wartime Rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina", p. 806. </fnote><fnote>Ibid., p. 811. </fnote>Lastly, it is indeed difficult to find a war where women's groups have not "braved ethnic terror and national militaries to march, demonstrate and demand peace". Women have actively participated in ethnic conflicts by being actors in peace processes. In particular, there is an ever expanding circle of women in the capital cities of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina who are working within and across borders to achieve a deeper level of reconciliation. It is interesting to note that women groups were the only groups that established links across former Yugoslavia when every other civil society network collapsed during the war. Women were using diverse strategies to achieve peace. Women's groups such as the Women in Black organization often use local demonstrations and peace protests to protest against Serbian nationalist aggression in Kosovo and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. There are multiple examples of how women have cooperated across ethnic and national boundaries; "Women from Osijek, Croatia, in the Eastern Slavonia region heavily destroyed by heavy shelling at the frontline with Serbia, cooperate with women from Serbia to organize meetings of divided families and friends from both sides of the cease-fire line. Women from Kosovo and Belgrade are cooperating to finance their groups by selling handicrafts in a second-hand shop". <fnote>Handrahan, "Conflict, Gender, Ethnicity and Post-Conflict Reconstruction", p. 439. </fnote><fnote>Jill Benderly, "Rape, Feminism and Nationalism in the War in Yugoslav Successor States", in Lois A.

There are always opportunities for women to articulate their own position in ethnic conflicts in accord with their experiences and to direct their own struggle for a politics of inclusion. The common fears and shared experiences that women have as women, mothers and wives may lead to the "patriotism of the victimized"  or more aptly put as patriotism of the vulnerable, pushing them to be agents of their own fate. <fnote>Ibid., p. 71. </fnote><heading>Ambivalent Empowerment<fnote> Darini Rajasingham-Senanayake, 'Ambivalent Empowerment: The Tragedy of Tamil Women in Conflict', p.113.</fnote></heading>Up till this stage, the essay has evidently illuminated women's "invisible" yet diverse roles in ethnic conflict, transcending the gender chains that have confined women's limited experiences to that of a passive female victim. By that, the essay has also ironically empowered women simply by according women some recognition and respect of their own will and freedom as an active agent in ethnic conflicts. However, the extent of empowerment women has achieved during the war and in the aftermath remains highly debateable and problematic. <heading>To what extent are women empowered during war in their respective roles? </heading>Women are most directly empowered during ethnic conflicts when they participate as an active combatant however the extent of their empowerment is questionable. After all, women participate in a political framework or context created by men. Thus, their roles and actual power are still male-controlled and male-dominated. Women are also absent from the actual political and decision-making processes. Taking examples from the military structure of the LTTE, Chandra de Silva noted that "although there is a women's military wing however there is no evidence of their participation in policymaking, decision-making or planning at the highest levels". Even if women have gone to the frontlines, they have been exalted as mythical figures confirming that "women enter history only when they take on masculine roles". The reality is that while women are empowered to take on new roles and responsibilities unsubscribed to gender norms, these roles and responsibilities are often defined within a patriarchal context.  <fnote>Korac, "Understanding Ethnic-National Identity and its Meaning - Questions from Women's Experience", p. 138. </fnote><fnote>Alison, "Cogs in the Wheel? Women in the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam", p. 47. </fnote><fnote>Korac, "Understanding Ethnic-National Identity and its Meaning - Questions from Women's Experience", p. 139. </fnote><fnote>Alison, "Cogs in the Wheel? Women in the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam", p. 51. </fnote><heading>To what extent are women empowered after wars? </heading>Keeping that in mind, another crucial issue is the extent to which women's participation in the public sphere will be carried through and sustained in peacetime. After all, we must be reminded that "women's participation in the public arena of the armed struggle is certainly no guarantee that women have finally penetrated into the public sphere of activities on a basis of gender equality". Historical records have confirmed that the patriarchal system may reassert itself when priorities in nation building and governance change which will not defend the spaces women has created during struggle, neither will it acknowledge the ingenious ways in which women bear new and additional responsibilities. Hence, the sustainability of women's participation in the public sphere in peacetime is also dependent on the outcomes of conflicts. <fnote>Ibid., p. 48. </fnote><fnote>Samarasinghe, "Soldiers, Housewives and Peace makers: Ethnic Conflict and Gender in Sri Lanka", p.221. </fnote>Furthermore, post-conflict development programmes and peace negotiations are often male-dominated activities given the disproportionate male government and military force representation in these processes. Most evidently, a study conduced by Elisabeth Rehn and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who have exhaustively examined nearly all of the key actors involved in post-conflict reconstruction, noted that none of the "single transition plan meets even the most basic requirements of gender mainstreaming". They asserted that the World Bank Reconstruction and Development Programme in Bosnia and Herzegovina lacks a gender analysis and "mentions women only once in a micro-credit section". Similarly, the World Bank Group Transitional Support Strategy for Kosovo does not incorporate gender issues.  <fnote>Moser and Clark, "Introduction", p. 10. </fnote><fnote>Rehn, Elisabeth & Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Women, War, and Peace: The Independent Experts' Assessment on the Impact of Armed Conflict on Women and Women's Role in Peace-Building (New York: UNIFEM, 2002), p. 124-125, quoted by Handrahan, "Conflict, Gender, Ethnicity and Post-Conflict Reconstruction", p. 441. </fnote><fnote>Handrahan, "Conflict, Gender, Ethnicity and Post-Conflict Reconstruction", p. 441. </fnote><fnote>Ibid., p. 441. </fnote>As a result, women's agency during conflicts has often been dismissed and women's issues have often been overlooked during post-war reconstruction. Without consideration of gender and women issues, security becomes an empty concept particularly in post-conflict settlings. Women previously engaged in military services will need support with demobilization and reintegration programmes. Non combatant women who have found new spaces of empowerment in the conflict will need sustained assistance and respect to maintain their new found mobility and independence. The return to peace should not mean a return to pre-war gender status quo. In actuality, international humanitarian programmes and peace processes may prolong the trauma of the women they are trying to assist. Indeed, women are deemed even more vulnerable when relief aid is not conceptualised to "sustain women's empowerment and leadership roles"  within an altered social or political structure. <fnote>Rajasingham-Senanayakem, "Ambivalent Empowerment: The Tragedy of Women in Conflict", p.122. </fnote><heading>Conclusion</heading>There are two main tenets encapsulated by the term "ambivalent empowerment" which thematically strings the various arguments in this essay together. <fnote>Rajasingham-Senanayake, 'Ambivalent Empowerment: The Tragedy of Tamil Women in Conflict', p.113 </fnote>The fundamental concept of "empowerment" is dealt with in the first part of the essay. Essentially, ethnic conflict discourses have often attributed full agency to men while women have been relegated to being a passive recipient. To counter this traditional and gendered notion of victimhood, the essay has pushed forth arguments for women's empowerment in ethnic conflicts based on empirical evidences obtained from the Rwandan, Yugoslavian and Sri Lankan case studies. By first understanding the basis of the victimhood discourse, academic scholarship should transcend that by taking a step further to examine how women often play a greater role than presumed - as mothers of the nation, combatants for the nation, perpetrators against the nation and peacemakers to rebuild the nation. Upon establishing women's empowerment in ethnic conflicts, the second part of the essay then addresses the "ambivalent" nature of this empowerment during and after conflicts. It has been firmly established that women may be empowered symbolically rather than realistically. After all, they may be conscious agents acting out of their own will, albeit being actors framed within a patriarchal system inevitably. From another perspective, empowerment is a contextualised notion; specific political, economic and socio-cultural conditions may give rise to experiences of empowerment which may be transitory and elusive. Hence women, like men, are capable of being empowered in ethnic conflicts which open up new opportunities and spaces for new roles and responsibilities yet the extent of empowerment often varies according to circumstances. Stringing the above core ideas together, Darini Rajasingham-Senanayake's phrase 'ambivalent empowerment' seems to fit best when we critically analyse women's agency beyond victimhood in ethnic conflicts. This conclusion brings about two main implications which impact gender studies generally and women's identity specifically. <fnote>Rajasingham-Senanayake, 'Ambivalent Empowerment: The Tragedy of Tamil Women in Conflict', p.113. </fnote>Firstly, the way and extent to which women may be empowered by their roles and experiences in ethnic conflicts has "theoretical and practical ramifications for gender sensitive analyses as well as for national or international feminist politics". Most feminist human rights theorists and activists have often built their arguments for more equality and justice on the basis of gender discrimination and female victimhood. This illuminates a broader conundrum for feminists: "how do they address women's human rights if in so 'doing', they rectify certain (unhelpful, incomplete, potentially essentialist) constructs that they also wish to - or need to - annihilate?" After all, most of the existing international mechanisms for addressing wartime sexual violence also tend to "reify the male-perpetrator/female victim paradigm". For many feminists who are committed to peace, the notion of female perpetrators becomes an anomaly in their studies, indirectly affirming the perception that women are almost always conceived as victims and nothing more. On this note, there should definitely be more awareness for women's rights in conflicts but we should not overplay women's victimhood in wars which would ironically chain us to the gender norms that we aspire to be liberated from. <fnote>Giles, "Introduction", p.1. </fnote><fnote>Alison, ""Wartime Sexual Violence: Women's Human Rights and Questions of Masculinity", p. 89. </fnote><fnote>Ibid., p. 89. </fnote>Secondly, casting women in a different light also changes how women perceive themselves. Starting from the premise of women's victimization and marginalization in ethnic conflicts may ironically be the best way to illuminate women's identities and lives. Since the experience and threat of sexual violence has been a dominant feature in the construction of women's identities in relation to men, "victimhood constitutes a core element in women's understanding of themselves". From this point of departure, women are equally empowered to construct themselves with the identity of peace activists or agents of war when the opportunities arise. Henceforth, we have progressed from examining the victimhood mentality of women to exploring the non-victim roles that women play, which truly reinforces the diversity of womanhood. <fnote>Engle, "Feminism and Its (Dis)contents: Criminalizing Wartime Rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina", p. 814. </fnote><fnote>Tina Sideris, "Problems of Identity, Solidarity and Reconciliation" in Sheila Meintjes, Anu Pillay and Meredeth Turshen, eds., The Aftermath: Women in Post Conflict Transformation (New York, Zed Books Ltd, 2001), p. 49 </fnote><fnote>Ibid., p.51. </fnote>To end it off, women's victimhood identity is truly transcended when we explore the other diverse roles women play in ethnic conflicts. Above all, this symbolic transcendence of victimhood will only be a true socio-cultural transformation when external patriarchal structures are eradicated in conjunction with the development of an internal process of consciousness within the minds of people; creating a universal language that will legitimate women's empowerment in midst of conflicts, furthermore providing women with a sense of their own agency
