<heading>Referral information</heading> was on an emergency referral SOS list with his respiratory physician, and was therefore admitted directly to the respiratory ward following self-referral. <heading>History</heading><heading>PC: </heading>Mr  presented with breathlessness, wheezing and a significantly reduced PEF. He was unable speak and was using accessory muscles to aid breathing. <heading>HPC: </heading>Mr  had been suffering from a mild chest infection for approximately ten days, producing about a tablespoon of sputum daily. He is a known asthmatic and had been taking 20mg prednisolone daily during this period in order to maintain control of his asthma. He reported that he had been becoming increasingly breathless over the two days prior to his admission. The night before his admission he was woken from sleeping by extreme breathlessness and wheezing. He tried using nebulised salbutamol several times throughout the night, however this had little effect and his PEFR fell to 250. A PEFR of 250 represented a significant reduction over his usual documented PEFR which was reported 550-600, and as high as 700 "on a good day". He contacted the respiratory unit and was subsequently admitted directly to the ward. <heading>PMH: </heading> has a well-documented history of ongoing asthma since the age of three. Throughout his childhood he suffered from very severe asthma, which resulted in near continuous admission between October and March as well as several additional admissions. Despite a comparatively moderate period during his late teens and early twenties, his asthma became problematic again once he reached thirty. His last hospital admission was in May 2004. This was one of three hospital admissions related to his asthma last year, one of which resulted in a 3-week stay. In recent years, he has required hospital admission on average once a year, however this used to be as much as 3-5/year. In 1999 and 2002 he required admission to ICU. His exercise tolerance varies daily, ranging from no limitation to a few metres on a bad day. Mr  is a particularly fragile asthmatic who is allergic to numerous allergens, however he suggested southern and foreign air were relieving factors. Mr  reported that he has learned to control his asthma appropriately. Whenever necessary he will increase the dose of his home medication to control his symptoms and initiate prednisolone if needed. If such measures prove unsuccessful and he feels like he is losing control, he will contact the hospital for additional support. His additional medical history includes osteoporosis (which has resulted in 3-4 wedge fractures) and osteoarthritis (hips, knees, shoulder) which had occurred secondary to his history of frequent steroid use. He previously used 5-10mg prednisolone for over 15years. He also suffers from BPH and frequent UTI's. There is no history of hayfever or eczema. Previous surgery includes arthroscopy (both knees, shoulder) and cleft palate correction. <heading>Drugs and allergies: </heading> is a non-smoker who consumes 10-12units of alcohol per week. Known drug allergy to erythromycin. He has allergies to all animals and has had a positive reaction to all allergens used during skin prick testing. There was no recollection of exposure to known allergens prior to this acute episode, however obviously his degree of hypersensitivity would make identifying such triggers difficult. <list><heading>His regular medication includes:</heading>Alendronate sodium 70mg once weekly (bisphosphonate for bone protection)Ventolin acuhaler PRNSeretide 500 acuhaler 2 puffs bd (one puff contains 500mcg Fluticasone and 50mcg salmeterol)Flixonase 2 sprays (100mcg) each nostril bdTrimethoprim 200mg od (UTI prophylaxis)Tamsulonsin 400mcg od (alpha blocker for BPH)Lansoprazole 30mg od (PPI)Theophylline (Dose depends on brand - brand unknown) - MUST MONITOR BLOOD LEVELS due to narrow therapeutic margin.

He lives in a privately owned house with his wife and son. His 15-year-old son also suffers from asthma, although it is well controlled. His wife works for a department store. As she usually works from home, she is able to visit  frequently when he is admitted. There was no history of recent travel. <heading>FH:</heading>Mother died aged 78 from CCF Father died of oesophageal cancer aged 78 Grandfather died of MI <heading>Analysis of history</heading>The presenting symptoms (i.e. wheezing, breathlessness, reduced PEFR) are typical of an acute asthma attack and given Mr 's history of chronic asthma, this is the most likely diagnosis. The onset of breathlessness at night also points towards asthma. As  appears to be a particularly fragile asthmatic, it is likely that his recent infection has precipitated this acute attack. On admission  was unable to complete sentences and his PEFR was significantly reduced (38% of normal) indicating an acute severe attack. A PEFR between 33%-50% usually suggests a severe attack, whilst <38% is regarded as life-threatening. On examination, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be examined. Specific signs should be sought in order to allow the severity to be assessed further. For example an increased respiratory rate (>25/min) and tachycardia (>110/min) would be expected in a severe attack. However bradycardia, hypotension and a reduced respiratory effort (or silent chest) may develop as the episode increases in severity and becomes life threatening. Other signs associated with hypoxia may also occur in life-threatening attack such as cyanosis, exhaustion and confusion. ABG values are also important for assessing the severity therefore results will be obtained if available. Important differential diagnoses to exclude would include an acute infective exacerbation of COPD, pulmonary oedema (cardiac asthma), URTI, PE, pneumothorax, anaphylactic shock and airway obstruction by a foreign body or tumour. Most of these are unlikely given his history. For example Mr  has no history of COPD, has never smoked and has not travelled recently. On admission, a CXR would be performed and therefore allow pneumothorax, pleural oedema and infection to be ruled out. The recent chest infection however may have exacerbated his asthma leading to this acute attack therefore signs of infection should be sought on the CXR. <heading>Physical examination and mental state examination</heading><heading>On admission:</heading><list>BP 150/65pO2 100% on 28% O2HR 75/minApyrexialRR 25Wheeze in upper zonesSilent chest in lower zonesABGpH 7.39pO 2 16.9pCO 2 4.9HCO 3 21.7mmol/LBE 2.6mmol/L</list><heading>Review following initial treatment:</heading><list><heading>RESP</heading>RR 16Symmetrical chest expansion Dull percussion at left baseReduced BS in bases.

Although Mr  also exhibited a silent chest in the lower zones, there were no additional signs to suggest a life-threatening attack. For example SpO 2=100%, PaO 2=16.9O and there was no evidence of hypotension, bradycardia or cyanosis. Physical examination also revealed evidence to suggest a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly in the left lung. However a chest x-ray was not available to allow radiological confirmation. It is proposed that the silent lower lobes initially detected may have been due to partially collapsed lobes arising due to the LRTI, however again this would radiological confirmation. Following examination therefore the most likely diagnosis is an acute severe asthma attack secondary to the recent LRTI. There was no evidence to suggest a cardiac origin for the breathlessness and no ABG abnormalities were detected. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s)</heading>Mr  is suffering from an acute severe asthma attack and a LRTI. As  is an intelligent patient who understands his condition well and knows when to approach the hospital for additional treatment, this recent attack is unlikely to have any psychological implications upon his health. However it is important to consider that  may be concerned about the possibility of requiring admission to ICU or another prolonged stay. In particular the implications a prolonged stay would have upon his family and employment. Fortunately  reported having an extremely supportive family and employer, however these are undoubtedly important issues to consider in asthmatic patients especially as emotion stress is itself a proven trigger factor. <heading>Management</heading><heading>Investigations</heading>In addition to the PEF, ABG and CXR mentioned above, further investigations such as FBC, U&E and sputum MC&S should be performed on asthmatics suffering from an acute exacerbation. Although these investigations were requested, no results were available at the time. <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading>"Although you correctly started high dose prednisolone as soon as you noticed you were becoming ill, it appears that the recent infection has upset the finite control of your asthma. Therefore we will need to admit you to the respiratory ward so that your symptoms can be monitored and treated appropriately until they become stable. Whilst you're in hospital we will treat the infection with antibiotics and alter your medication appropriately so that control of your asthma can be regained. Do you have any questions?" <heading>Prescription/medical intervention</heading>When presented with a suspected asthma attack, treatment should be started immediately before any investigations are initiated.

His regular out patient medication was also resumed in order to prevent further disruption of his asthma maintenance. <heading>Observation</heading>It would be important to monitor 's PEFR whilst he remains an in-patient, in order to assess his lung function and response to therapy. The results are shown below: <table/>The measurements show an obvious improvement his PEF since admission. As  usually records a PEF of 550-600 this would be the desirable level to achieve before considering discharge. It would also be important to ensure that he was stable on his TTO medication prior to discharge. <heading>Referral and team working</heading>'s GP should be notified of the admission and any alterations made to his regular medication. All patients admitted with severe asthma should also be followed up by a respiratory specialist for one year as per the british thoracic society (BTS) guidelines. An initial clinic follow-up at two weeks was arranged for . <heading>Advice and Prevention</heading> was provided with home oxygen prior to discharge in order to provide symptomatic relief in case of further episodes of acute dyspnoea. He already understands the need to initiate prednisolone therapy during times when asthma control becomes challenging and regularly receives the necessary influenza vaccinations. Although there are numerous non-pharmaceutical measures which could be suggested for managing asthma, the majority of these are unproven and not recommended by the BTS. They are therefore unlikely to beneficial to  especially considering his experience living with the disease. For general reference some of the suggested recommendations are shown below: <list><heading>Primary prevention:</heading>Encourage breast feedingSmoking cessation should be encouraged in parents and parents-to-be</list><list><heading>Secondary prevention:</heading>Reducing levels of house dust mites may help in committed families who use multiple approaches, however the BTS asthma guidelines suggest there is no evidence indicating that single interventions are sufficient to help those with asthma.Removal of pets when a recognisable allergy is detectedEncourage smoking cessation</list><list><heading>Dietary manipulation</heading>Weight control is recommended for obese patients</list>Complementary therapy A recent Cochrane review (Yorke & Shuldham, updated 2005) indicated that family therapy may have a role alongside pharmacotherapy in the treatment of difficult childhood asthma. Although this recommendation was subsequently adopted by the BTS in its guidelines, the studies upon which they were based appear to be limited by extremely small study sizes (55 children) and therefore further studies are obviously required. <heading>Outcome</heading> was followed-up as an in-patient two days after admission. On examination he was sat up comfortably and could easily talk without becoming breathless (RR=11). His PEFR was stable at around 380. Two weeks later at clinic, he reported a stable PEFR of around 450-500 and despite one incidence of dyspnoea, which required the use of home oxygen (for ~1.5hrs) he was generally well. No further fixed follow-up was therefore arranged. <heading>Evidence based care and issues for research</heading>As a result of the high prevalence of asthma within the general population, a vast amount of information exists within the literature. Fortunately the british thoracic society has published guidelines to aid physicians with the diagnosis and treatment of asthma based upon the best available evidence. The 'British guideline on the management of asthma' therefore provides a valuable resource when treating asthmatics (British Thoracic Society, 2003). <heading>Commentary</heading><heading>Epidemiology</heading>Asthma is increasing in prevalence, particularly in the Western world, where approximately 5-15% of the population may be symptomatic and receiving treatment. However despite improvements in treatment, mortality rates have also been decreasing and asthma accounts for almost 1500 deaths per year in the UK. Interestingly there is also a geographical variation, with the condition being more common in developed countries such UK, New Zealand and Australia where some of the highest rates can be found. In contrast, asthma is much more rare in Africa, Central Europe and Far Eastern countries such as China and Malaysia. Studies investigating this variation have shown a correlation with 'Westernised' life-styles that include living conditions that favour house-dust mites and atmospheric pollution (Ward et al, 2002). <heading>Impact on your learning</heading>This case has highlighted the importance of rapidly diagnosing and initiating treatment in patients with a suspected asthma attack. In a case such as this it is essential that appropriate therapy is given immediately with a view to regaining control of the asthma, no matter what the cause of the attack. These patients should be closely supervised and subsequent re-assessment should be carried out frequently to ensure that any further deterioration is detected and addressed appropriately. Once the patient has been stabilised, further investigations should be performed to identify potential causes for the acute exacerbation (e.g. infection, recent change in medication). This case has also highlighted the importance of patient education and the need to consider psychosocial factors such as unemployment when treating chronic asthmatics.
