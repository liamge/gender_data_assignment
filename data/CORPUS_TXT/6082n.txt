<heading>Introduction and Aims</heading>This is an example of nucleophilic acyl substitution (at a carbonyl carbon): A nucleophile (Nu:); phenoxide (PhO-) an electron rich species that usually reacts with an electron deficient species i.e. electrophile. An acyl group R-C=O (R can be alkyl / aryl) A substitution mechanism that leaving group (LG); chloride (Cl-) is replaced by Nu: The reaction between an unknown phenol A and an acid / acyl chloride (benzoyl chloride) was investigated in this experiment, in order to identify the unknown phenol A from the melting point of the crystalline derivative produced. Here is the mechanism diagram: <heading>Hazards</heading><list>Avoid skin contact FORMULA Unknown phenol A - toxic, wear glovesBenzoyl chloride (C 7H 5ClO) - irritant, always keep in fume cupboard2M NaOH (aq) - corrosiveEthanol (C 2H 5OH) - highly flammable, avoid sources of ignitionGood laboratory practice always applies esp. use of glass tubes and Bunsen burner in measuring melting point.</list><heading>Methods and Observations</heading>1.0g unknown phenol (brown solution) in 10ml 2M NaOH (aq) was dissolved in a stoppered boiling tube. The solution turned to dark orange brown, looks similar to iodine solution, after NaOH addition. In a fume cupboard, 2ml C 7H 5ClO was added from burette, stoppered and shaken vigorously for 5-10min / until precipitate becomes granular. The solution turned from dark orange brown into red orange. White / pale yellow precipitates formed. Meanwhile, the boiling tube became warm, which indicated this is an exothermic reaction. All crude product was filtered off using a buchner funnel at water pump Any lumps were crushed and washed well with distilled H 2O crude product was collected and weighed Crude product was recrystallised with minimum hot C 2H 5OH, until solution run down was clear (clear light brown solution observed). Left to dry. Solid was dissolved in ice cold C 2H 5OH. Filtered. Purified solid was removed from mother liquor at pump and dried. Purified solid was placed into a labelled specimen bottle and dried in desiccator over fresh anhydrous CaCl 2 until next practical session for testing its melting point. <heading>Testing Melting Point</heading>Either end of 3 glass tubes were sealed using a Bunsen burner Trace amount of purified solid was tapped down into the tubes Tubes then were placed into the 3 holes of a melting point thermometer. Switched on. The purified solid in tubes were observed down the magnifying glass installed. The melting point was noted from the thermometer attached once the purified solid started to melt. <heading>Results and Calculations</heading><table/><table/> FORMULA  Percentage Yield <heading>Discussion</heading>The average melting point of unknown phenol A is calculated as 98oC, which is the nearest to the one of m-nitrophenyl benzoate - C13H9O4N (95oC). This slightly higher value, difference of 3 oC, than literature melting point shows some impurities were likely to be present thus to increase the melting point. This is due to some sources of errors: The main source of error is probably transfers of chemicals e.g. at the beginning, 1.0g unknown phenol was first transferred from the bottle to a weighing boat to be weighed, then to the boiling tube. Collecting all possible crystalline product from the filter paper after filtration is always hard. A spatula is suggested to scrap off all product, this however increases the amount of impurities (filter paper material). Thus the melting point of phenol A is affected. For measuring melting point of phenol A, triplicate glass tubes of purified solid were prepared, which increases reliability of results. A melting point thermometer was used to measure melting point, which is heavily dependent on the experimenter's judgement. It could result delay in noting melting points of the three samples while reading off from the thermometer manually. It is possible to also use an Electrothermal - electronic melting point thermometer, thus to compare two sets of values obtained from both thermometers. This surely increases the validity of the results. Vigorous shaking and mixing of unknown phenol, NaOH (aq) and C 7H 5ClO can be achieved by using an electric mixer. This enables a more efficient and controlled step. It is good laboratory practice to have rinsed the apparatus e.g. glass rod and edge of the funnel with minimum C 2H 5OH, in order to obtain all product formed. Accurate apparatus is used e.g. 50cm 3-burette (calibrated to Â±0.05cm 3) was used to obtain 2ml C 7H 5ClO. The percentage yield is calculated as 44.3%, which shows a relatively low yield of crystalline. In other words, a relatively low efficiency in preparation, which could be explained by other possibilities: not all of the crystals crystallised from solution in recrystallisation. The reaction did not even go to completion in shaking (Step 2). <heading>Conslusion</heading>From the minor difference of the melting points between the literature value and the experimental results, the unknown phenol A used is m-nitrophenyl benzoate; C13H9O4N. <heading>Questions</heading><heading>2.) Principles of recrystallisation:</heading>According to the Oxford Online Reference Recrystallisation is 'a process of repeated crystallisation in order to purify a substance or to obtain more regular crystals of a purified substance. ' Thus Recrystallisation should result in a purer sample.
