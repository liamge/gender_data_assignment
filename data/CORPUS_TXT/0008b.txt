The moment of inertia of the three discs is  FORMULA  for the 75mm disc,  FORMULA  for the 63.50mm disc and  FORMULA for 50mm disc. Comparing the results with those derived from the theoretical relationship it is found to be consistent with a maximum percentage of error of 7%.

At the end of the experiment, the moments of inertia of the three disc is determined and compared with the values derive using the theoretical relationship. An estimate of the precision and accuracy of the measurements will be made as well. <heading>Theory</heading>According to Foundation of Engineering, Holtzapple Reece (2003) torque is a twisting force, which is determined by position vector r and force vector F.  FORMULA  When force is applied at right angle to the radius  FORMULA  Newton's second law states that Force F is equal to mass m multiplied by gravitational constant g.  FORMULA  Substituting equation a in to b, T Torque is equal to m mass multiplied by g gravitational acceleration and r radius.  FORMULA  On the other hand  FORMULA  angular acceleration is a linear acceleration divided by radius r of the moment arm.  FORMULA  Based on the constant linear acceleration formula  FORMULA  Where s is distant traveled, u is initial velocity, a is acceleration and t is time. In this experiment the weight always start from  FORMULA , thus u is  FORMULA .  FORMULA  Substituting equation 3 into 2  FORMULA  Rotational analogy of the  Newton's 2nd Law states that  FORMULA  Where T is Torque, I is 2nd Moment of Mass and Angular acceleration Substituting equation 1 and 4 into 5 and rearranging will give  FORMULA  Equation 6 is a formula that relates the rotational analogy of Newton's 2nd law with linear motion. In this experiment the variables are as follow <list>m is the mass of the weightss is the height that the weights fall throughI is the second moment of massg is the gravitational accelerationr is the radius of the moment armt is the time taken for the weight to fall the distance s.</list>Please refer to appendix 1 for more detail on the theory and assumptions made in this experiment. <heading>3.0 Apparatus and Methods</heading><heading>Apparatus</heading>The Apparatus provided include a wooden platform, non extensible string, mass hanger (100g), mass (20g, 50g), 3 disc of varying diameter, moment arm fixed to the wooden platform, ruler (1m) and a stop watch. <figure/><heading>Methods used to determine the Constants of this experiment</heading>After investigating the apparatus provided and the theory behind the experiment, I have decided measure the time for the weight to fall through a distance L. The length L is set as the distance from the table to the botttom of the mass hanger when the string is fully wrapped around the moment arm. The reason is because it is easier to know the exact moment to stop the stopwatch when the mass hanger hit the table as the impact of the mass hanger on the table will certainly be audible. The height of the hanger is fixed by the position of the "knot" of the string that ties the hanger to the arm. The initial position for the "knot" will be just touching the moment arm when winded. Which are also exactly 8 loops the string make around the moment arm. In order to measure this distance accurately the distance of the "knot" on the string from the moment arm when the bottom of the weight hanger is just touching the table is measured. This is because instead of aimlessly waving the ruler around trying to ensure it is perpendicular to the table, the ruler can use the string as a guide. <figure/>The other measurement needed is the radius r of the moment arm. The radius r of the moment arm is small compared to the sensitivity of the meter rule. Therefore an alternative method has been devised to determine the radius r. <figure/>Three measurements is needed to be taken <list>Length of String when fully extended (y)Length of Moment Arm (x)Number of pitch or "rounds" of string fully wraps around the moment arm (n)</list>Using Pythagoras rule the following formula is derived.  FORMULA  <heading>Method of the Experiment</heading>Begin the experiment using the largest disc. From theory it will have a larger second moment of inertia and thus the largest t time. The radius of the disc is measured and recorded. The mass hanger with an initial mass of 100 grams is hooked on to the loop on the string. The string then wrapped around the moment arm until the string's "knot" is just touching the moment arm. This is the initial starting position. The palm of the hand should be supported by the platform with only the tip of the finger touching the disc preventing it from turning. This is to prevent the hand from providing additional torque when releasing the disc. With another hand holding a stopwatch, simultaneously lift the supporting finger and start the stopwatch. The stopwatch is stopped as soon as the mass hanger touches the table. The time for the mass hanger to fall is recorded Steps above are repeated by varying the mass on the mass hanger. (0.12grams, 0.15grams, 0.17grams, 0.20grams, 0.22grams) using the same disc When done the experiment is repeated with the 2 other discs. A graph of m/kg (y axes)  FORMULA (x axes) is plotted for all 3 discs. Two gradients are drawn for each graph. The least and the most possible gradient for the graphs. This is in order to obtain a range of possible values of I instead of one single value. <heading>4.0 Observations and Results</heading><heading>Height L(mm) </heading><table/><heading>Length of String x(mm)</heading><table/><heading>Length of Moment Arm Y(mm)</heading><table/><heading>Radius of Disc</heading><table/>Using a steel ruler with a 1mm graduation the measurement of length is possible to a precision 0.50mm. Therefore the uncertainty for each of the above measurement is estimated to be +/-0.5mm. Number of pitch (n) is calculated to be 8. <heading>Time for weight to fall through distant L</heading><table/><table/><table/>Using electronic stopwatch, the measurement of time is possible to a precision of 0.1 of a second. Although the watch gives reading in 2 decimal places the reading is rounded up to the closest decimal place because the stopwatch is controlled by human, and the human reaction times vary from people to people. Therefore the error and uncertainty in each of the measurement above is +/-0.1s. <heading>5.0 Analysis and Discussion of Results</heading><heading>Analysis of Results</heading><heading>Radius of the moment arm</heading>Using values obtained from above r is calculated from equation 7 and is 0.00533m. <heading>Gradient of graph</heading><table/><heading>Moment of Inertia</heading>From Equation 6, Gradient =  FORMULA . The moment of Inertia I is calculated for each gradient value. With s equal L (0.30m), g equal  FORMULA  and r equal 0.00533m. <table/><heading>Theoretical Moment of Inertia</heading>Moment of Inertia is calculated from the theoretical formula  FORMULA  provided in the briefing sheet. The value of M mass for each disc is also provided in the briefing sheet. <table/><heading>Discussion of Results</heading>The observation is consistent with theoretical prediction. Comparing the moment of inertia of the three disc calculated from experimental results with those that is derive using the theoretical formula, it is found that all three values calculated from the theory lays within the range of experimental results. The mean moment of Inertia for each disc is very close to the theoretical prediction with at most  FORMULA  deviation. This error and uncertainly might be contributed by the following assumptions The applied torque is assumed to be constant. While this assumption is perfectly reasonable, it does introduce a certain amount of error to the final result. In actual case the torque does varies a little because of air resistance. In order to improve the result, where possible conduct this experiment in vacuum. The apparatus is assumed to be perfect. The bearings are assumed to be frictionless. However in actual case, the bearings does have an opposing force that resists motion. In order to improve the experimental results I would recommend putting oil on moving parts of the apparatus to reduce frictional forces from influencing the results. One other assumption made is that the linear acceleration is constant. This assumption is made so that a can be expressed in terms of constant linear acceleration formula. By having a means of directly measuring the angular acceleration might improve the accuracy of results. With the percentage of uncertainty and error at most 7% for the smallest disc and only 5% for the largest disc the results obtained from this experiment is fairly reliable. Given that the theory behind the experiment is correct, I am fairly confident with the values obtained. This is especially true for the larger discs. <heading>6.0 Conclusions</heading>Based on the results observed from the experiment the following conclusions can be drawn. Newton 2nd law does hold for rotational motion. The rotational analogy of the law is  FORMULA . Whereby T is torque of the system, I is the 2nd moment of mass and a is the angular acceleration. This conclusion is based on the finding that I obtained by the experiment is consistent with the value calculated by the theoretical relationship given by  FORMULA  Second moment of mass of an object is proportional to the mass and radius of the object. The heavier and the larger the radius, the higher the value of the 2nd moment of mass will be. Assumption made during the experiment will significantly affect the results obtained. Therefore reasonable care should be taken to assure that those assumption made is justifiable and will not introduce a huge error to the experiment.
