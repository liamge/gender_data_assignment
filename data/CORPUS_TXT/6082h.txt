<heading>Introduction</heading>Prospective - A 6-Day weighed dietary survey, the 'gold standard' adapted by the health professionals, is recorded individually. A description of each food and its weight in grams are recorded before eaten, within 6 days. Retrospective - Data is input into the Foodbase computer software. The intake of energy and nutrients of an individual is then assessed. The report processed is shown below: <heading>Results</heading><table/><heading>Discussion</heading><heading>Comparing Results and DRVs (RNI)</heading><table/>According to the report and Table 1, my diet is generally low in energy (832kcals less than recommended), which is only about 57% of the DRV; also low in calcium, with 177mg less than DRV; potassium, 1150mg less, 66% of recommended amount consumed; Iron, 4.1mg less than DRV. For more minerals, such as selenium, with only two third of DRV is consumed; about half of the daily recommendation of  iodine is consumed, which is the nutrient that I lack of mostly. Being living in UK, a more developed country, people are often nourished. From the results, there are more nutrients with higher intake between the DRVs than those I lack of. Surprisingly, I have a double vitamin C intake than recommended. 'Taking 1000 mg or less of vitamin C a day is unlikely to cause any harm' (Food Standards Agency). However, prolonged diet high in sodium (salt) - 20% more is consumed then recommended - increases the risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and stroke, which I need to beware of. Meanwhile, there is appropriate intake of protein, magnesium, copper, folate. <heading>Ways to Improve my Diet</heading>To consume more sea fish and shellfish in order to increase iodine intake in particular. Good sources of potassium include fruit such as bananas, vegetables, pulses, nuts and seeds, milk, beef, chicken, turkey and bread. Meanwhile, milk can also increase calcium intake. To reduce salt intake, I can: Add fresh herbs, black pepper, garlic, ginger and lime which give more flavour Make sauces with ripe ingredients e.g. tomatoes and garlic, again to bring a stronger flavour Marinade meat and fish in advance <heading>Advantages</heading>A very suitable dietary survey method assessing individuals. Few sources of error than past intake e.g. FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) since it does not rely on memory; no error in portion size Cheap and easy to carry out - in terms of equipment, only an electronic scale and the food database are needed. Relatively quick method comparing to some other dietary survey methods, which usually take more than six days. <heading>Limitations of Methodology</heading>"Diet histories of this type are fraught with interpretation difficulties" (Bingham, 1985 and 1987) Patience and care required for proper data entry i.e. it is rather tedious to have to enter the data for every food that consumed in six days. High degree of cooperation of the subject is needed. Data on some food items not available in the database, my own interpretation is required to select the nearest food material. E.g. chocolate drink is chosen as there is no cereal drink available. My high salt intake could be due to no option for boiling some kinds of vegetables in unsalted water, and "boiled with salted water" is the only choice. Selecting the wrong or different item can make a big difference to the final data. The weighing scale has a low accuracy to only about 5g, salt and sugar intake or other small dietary additions e.g. a small clover of garlic are not being able to weigh Weighing is not always possible due to embarrassment caused especially in public areas, simply as having a meal in the restaurant. Estimations have to be made. Therefore the reliability and accuracy of the survey will be affected. Biases caused - reported diet may not reflect the actual diet as subjects choose not to have certain food types to avoid the difficulties in weighing every ingredient of the item. E.g. sandwich with a mixture of fillings. Heavily dependent on food composition table used to estimate nutrient intake that are likely to contain errors. <heading>Conclusion</heading>Any measurement of diet will be biased in some way by the measurement process itself, so in practice, there is no entirely objective measures of an individual's food consumption. Since the Foodbase report processed has determined my intake of energy and other nutrients by the 6-day weighed dietary survey, the aim of the experiment has been reached. This again emphasises the importance of a balanced diet.
