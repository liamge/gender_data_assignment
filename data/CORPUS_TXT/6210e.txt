<heading>Aim:</heading>To investigate how the boiling point of Cyclohexane varies with pressure. <heading>Introduction and theory:</heading>The temperature at which the vapour pressure is equal to 1atm is the normal boiling point of that liquid. At some temperatures the energy of molecules is great enough for bubbles of vapour to form - the liquid boils. However at any lower temperature the bubbles collapse as soon as they form because the atmospheric pressure is greater than the vapour pressure inside the bubbles. Hence the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the vapour pressure equals the external pressure. When varying pressure; if a lower pressure is exerted on the liquids surface, less kinetic energy is needed to form bubbles and hence the temperature of the boiling point is less than for a higher pressure. Boiling point therefore depends on applied pressure (Vapour pressure increases with temperature) The Clausis-Clapeyron equation relater the temperature dependence of the vapour pressure of a liquid to the heat of vaporisation and can be used to find this figure. (dIn p/d (1/T) = -ΔHvap/R). Troutons rule states that for most un-associated liquids, ΔHvap is roughly independent of temperature; this is found by, ΔHvap being roughly equal to KT b. This is found to be true for most un-associated liquids other than those with extremely strong intermolecular forces, eg. Hydrogen bonding. <heading>Saftey/precautions:</heading><list>Chemicals: Cyclohexane (Flammable)Electrical: Vacuum pump (avoid getting mains connection wet), Heater.Other: Glass vacuum apparatus (wear safety glasses)</list>Appropriate lab wear must be worn including lab coat, gloves and goggles. All Chemical work should be carried out in a fume hood. <heading>Procedure:</heading>To begin the apparatus are set up; the boiling vessel (Cottrell pump), condenser and ballast flask are connected; in turn this is connected to a pressure gauge and the pressure gauge to the vacuum pump. Both taps on the pressure gauge are tightened and the pressure gauge switched on (the reading was 1000mbar). Cyclohexane (70cm3) and pumice granules were placed in the boiling vessel and the joints lightly greased. The pressure was adjusted to 400mbar; and the tap connected to the closed pump. The water supple to the condenser was turned on,. And the thermometer greased with glycerol. The Cyclohexane was then heated until boiling freely and the temperature at this point recorded. Pressure was then adjusted (by opening pressure gauge to pump tap) in steps of 100mbar to 1000mbar and using a viewer the temperature taken when the liquid boiled freely. <heading>Results:</heading><table/><figure/>A graph of pressure against temperature was plotted (graph 1), it can be seen that as the pressure increases; the temperature of the liquids boiling point also increases. A graph of Inp against 1/T was plotted (graph 2), from this graph we can obtain a value of ΔHvap; by working out the gradient and inserting this figure into the Clausis-Clapeyron equation. <heading>Discussion:</heading>Our value for -ΔHvap = 0.9kjmol-1, in comparison to a literature value for the -ΔHvap of cyclohexane = 30.8kjmol-1. From our experiment cyclohexane appears to obey Troutons rule. Troutons rule states that for most un-associated liquids, ΔHvap is roughly independent of temperature. From our results we can gather that the normal boiling point of cyclohexane at 1000mbar =62.5 oC.
