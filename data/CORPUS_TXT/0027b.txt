<abstract><heading>Summary</heading>The performance of a domestic solar collector water heating system is assessed using the f-chart empirical correlation method. Monthly averaged meteorological data, including the clearness index, global irradiation and temperatures, is provided for the location (London). Using the given system parameters, the fraction of the required heating load, fm that can be provided by the system, is calculated. It was found that the system performance varied from providing only 4% of the required heating in winter months, to 68% in summer. Comparison with typical electric and gas systems showed a 35% and 23% reduction in the yearly cost of energy is achievable by incorporation of a solar collector. Low costs of energy (electricity or gas) however mean that absolute fiscal savings may not be significant enough to provide fast payback on a potentially high-cost system. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>The system being considered is a domestic hot water system located in London (51.47˚, 0.317˚). An 8m 2 solar collector absorbs solar radiation and transfers heat to the collector fluid, a water-glycol mix (Figure 1). This then passes through a heat exchanger, heating water in the building's hot water system. An auxiliary heater ensures the required water temperature is achieved when the performance of the collector is reduced. The system contains a 300 litre store. It is assumed that 350 litres of hot water (60degC) are required each day. Table 1 shows monthly averaged values for solar irradiation, clearness index and water temperatures for the system location. The f-chart method will be used to assess the performance of the system over a year, and an estimate will be made of the cost savings over an equivalent electric and gas system. <table/><figure/><heading>The f-chart method</heading>The f-chart method uses empirical correlations to find the fraction of the heating load that can be provided by a particular system,  FORMULA . For liquid systems, this is given by;  FORMULA  (0.1) where X and Y are dimensionless parameters, representing the absorbed solar energy and collector heat losses respectively. These are given by; <list> FORMULA  (0.2)  FORMULA  (0.3)</list>where; <list> FORMULA  is the collector area (m 2) FORMULA  is the adjusted heat removal factor (taking into account the use of a heat exchanger.) FORMULA  is the loss coefficient for the collector (W/m2/K) FORMULA  is the reference temperature = 100 degC FORMULA  is the external ambient temperature (degC) FORMULA  is the number of seconds in the month FORMULA  is the monthly heat load (J) FORMULA  is the monthly average global irradiation on a tilted surface FORMULA  is the number of days in the month FORMULA  is the monthly average optical efficiency of the collector. </list>The method is valid for; <list> FORMULA  (0.4)  FORMULA  (0.5)  FORMULA  (0.6)  FORMULA  (0.7)</list>The monthly average optical efficiency of the collector,  FORMULA  is found using;  FORMULA  (0.8) where  FORMULA  is the optical efficiency of the collector through the normal to its surface, and  FORMULA  is mean angle incidence modifier which accounts for changes in optical efficiency at different incident beam angles. The monthly heat load can be found using;  FORMULA  (0.9) where m is the mass of water used during a day (i.e., ~350kg), Tw is the required water temperature (60degC) and N is the number of days in the month. Correction factors must be applied to account for storage capacity and the absence of an air heat exchanger from the system, respectively;  FORMULA  (0.10) which is valid for  FORMULA .  FORMULA  (0.11) where  FORMULA  is the required water temperature (60degC). The expressions required to calculate a number of the above parameters will follow. <heading>Solar Position</heading>The declination,  FORMULA , describes the angle between the equatorial plane and a line passing through the centre of both the earth and sun. Its value determines the trajectory of the sun through the day, which varies throughout the year;  FORMULA  (1.1) where 23.45 is the angle of the earth's tilt, and n is the day number (1 to 365). An average day number will be taken for each month, e.g., January n=17. The sunset angle for the month can now be found using;  FORMULA  (1.2) The apparent sunset angle for an inclined collector surface is given by;  FORMULA  (1.3) where  FORMULA  is the slope of the collector. This is different to equation (1.2) since during the summer, late sunsets (early sunrises) will be shielded from view by the inclination of the collector. During the winter however the actual sunrise will occur earlier than that in equation (1.3) and so the minimum of the two angles must be taken;  FORMULA  (1.4) Values of irradiation have been provided for a horizontal surface and need to be changed to correspond to those for an inclined surface. For beam radiation this can be done by using the ratio of beam radiation on a tilted surface ( FORMULA ) to that on a horizontal surface  FORMULA );  FORMULA  (1.5) where I is the beam irradiation on a direct path from the sun and  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  are the angles between the solar beam and the normal to the tilted and horizontal surfaces respectively. Cancelling I, and using known expressions for  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  gives;  FORMULA  (1.6) <heading>Amounts of Irradiation</heading>The diffuse radiation component can be expressed as a fraction of global radiation incident on a horizontal surface; <list> FORMULA  (1.7)  FORMULA  (1.8)</list>where  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  are the monthly mean diffuse and global radiation respectively, for a horizontal surface.  FORMULA  is the clearness index which expresses the proportion extraterrestrial radiation reaching the site, averaged over the month. The global irradiation on a surface can be expressed as the sum of the beam, diffuse and albedo (surface reflection) components;  FORMULA  (1.9) It is convenient to develop equation (1.1) to give the global irradiation on a tilted surface as a fraction of that the horizontal;  FORMULA  (1.10) where  FORMULA  gives the fraction of the horizontal global radiation that is the beam component (assuming the albedo component is small).  FORMULA  is the reflectivity of the ground, normally about 0.2. The global radiation on the tilted plane,  FORMULA  can then be found by multiplying equation 1.10 by the known values of the monthly averaged global radiation on a horizontal surface,  FORMULA . <heading>Heat Exchanger Factor</heading>The performance of a collector system is reduced by the use of a heat exchanger which elevates the temperature of the collector, increasing heat losses. The de Winter heat exchange factor accounts for this degradation of system performance; <enote>Lunde, P.J, Solar Thermal Engineering space heating and hot water systems, John Wiley and Sons, 1980, p244-245. </enote> FORMULA  (1.1) where  FORMULA  is the heat removal factor, Ac is the collector area, UL is the collector loss coefficient (W/m 2/K),  FORMULA  is the heat exchanger effectiveness,  FORMULA  and c p are the mass flow rate and specific heat capacity of the fluid respectively, where the subscript c corresponds to the collector fluid. The expression  FORMULA  accounts for the situation where the collector flow rate exceeds the storage flow rate- in which case the min flow is the storage flow. The adjusted heat removal factor,  FORMULA  can be found by multiplying the de Winter factor by the known heat removal factor of the system. <heading>Calculations for January</heading>The system has the following properties; <list>Collector area,  FORMULA  = 8m 2Heat removal factor,  FORMULA  = 0.8Collector loss coefficient,  FORMULA  = 3 W/m 2/KCollector slope,  FORMULA  = 45Collector-storage heat exchanger effectiveness,  FORMULA  = 0.7Collector fluid (water-glycol mix) flow rate = 0.07kg/sStorage water circulation rate = 0.06kg/sCollector fluid specific heat capacity =  FORMULA Storage water specific heat capacity =  FORMULA Water outlet temperature after auxiliary heat input = 60degCStorage size =300 litresWater use = 350 litres/dayNormal optical efficiency,  FORMULA  = 0.7Mean incidence angle modifier,  FORMULA  = 0.95Latitude = 51.47degLongitude = 0.317 degSurface albedo,  FORMULA  = 0.2</list>For the month in question (Table 1);  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . <list>Heat requirement during month FORMULA Declination FORMULA Sunset Angle FORMULA Ratio of beam on tilted to beam on horizontal FORMULA Diffuse fractionUse equation (1.4) since sunset angle,  FORMULA . FORMULA </list>Find ratio of global radiation on tilted surface to that on horizontal  FORMULA  Thus the monthly average global irradiation on the titled surface is  FORMULA  De Winter heat exchanger factor  FORMULA  which gives  FORMULA  Check that this is valid (equation (1.5)):  FORMULA . This is within the required range. Calculate dimensionless parameters X and Y  FORMULA  The correction factors must now be applied. Storage correction;  FORMULA  Check that this is valid- store size/standard store size =  FORMULA  = 0.5. This is a valid store size for the method to be applied. Hot water only correction;  FORMULA  Thus the corrected value of X is  FORMULA  (little change for this month). For Y, the optical efficiency is found using equation (1.6):  FORMULA . Thus,  FORMULA  System water heating fraction, fm Substituting X and Y into equation (1.10) gives;  FORMULA  i.e., 6% of the domestic water heating requirement can be provided for by the system during January. This is equates to  FORMULA  of heating being provided. Comparison with electric system Consider an electric water heating system with an overall heating efficiency of 95%. Off-peak electricity usage costs 2.7p per kWh. To provide January's water heating requirement (2634MJ = 732kWh) it would therefore cost;  FORMULA  Now consider the system with a solar collector (the electric system is the auxiliary heater.) The solar system contributes 161MJ (44.7kWh) which equates to a  FORMULA  saving. This is small, but one must take into account the poor performance of the solar system during the winter. A similar comparison will later be made for a gas-fired system. <heading>System Performance over year</heading>The heating fraction, fm has been calculated for each month of the year using the method described. The full calculations are shown in appendix A1. A summary of the results is given in Table 2 and Figure 2. As expected the system performance is highest during the summer (68%), but very poor during the winter months (as low as 4%). This is intrinsically problematic since heating requirements are greater during the winter than summer. Table 3 shows the potential yearly cost savings achievable by incorporation of a solar collector system with an electric or gas-fired system. For the electric system, an overall heating efficiency of 95% is assumed, with electricity costing 3.3p per kWh. For the gas-fired system, an efficiency of 65% is assumed, with gas costing 1.63p per kWh., It is calculated that yearly savings of £74 and £45 can be made for the electrical and gas systems respectively, equivalent to reductions of 34% and 23%. <enote> URL  Date accessed: 02/03/2005 </enote><enote> URL  Date accessed: 02/03/2005 </enote><enote> URL  Date accessed: 02/03/2005 </enote>Considering that a solar collector system is likely to cost in the region of thousands of pounds to install, savings of less than £100 per year give large payback times which, on a purely fiscal level, make the installation of a solar collector system unattractive. This problem is mainly the result of the current low costs of non-renewable energy. <table/><figure/><table/><table/><figure/><heading>Conclusions</heading>Solar collector water heating system is able to provide as much as 68% of the required heating load in the summer, but this falls to around only 4% in the winter months. Comparison with electric and gas-fired systems shows yearly energy costs are reduced by 34% and 23% respectively. Low costs of energy (electricity or gas) however mean that absolute fiscal savings may not be significant enough to provide fast payback on potentially high system costs.
