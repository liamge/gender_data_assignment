<heading>1.0 Introduction</heading>The laboratory session was carried out to find the moment of inertia of three metal discs of different sizes. The laboratory was carried out in groups of two and used a method to find the time taken for the provided weights to travel down a distance of the height of the stand provided with different sizes of discs. Multiple readings were taken for time to make it more accurate and this was an easy procedure to carry out because there were two members in the group to do different activities simultaneously. Two graphs were drawn for each disc and the theory used for this method used is further described below. <heading>2.0 Theory used for the laboratory and calculations</heading>Below is the theory used for the calculations done and for taking the readings:- <list>T = TorqueI = Inertiaa = Circular accelerationm = Mass usedr = Radius of the threaded mtal rods = Distance moved by masst = Time talen for the mass to go the distance 's' </list> FORMULA  And,  FORMULA  (Note:  FORMULA ) Therefore:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  and  FORMULA  Therefore:  FORMULA   FORMULA  (but  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ) Therefore:  FORMULA  The above equation is the main equation used to calculate inertia of the each disc and the graphs are plotted in accordance with the equation to make it easier to fit the values derived right in to the equation. <heading>3.0 Apparatus and Method used</heading><heading>Apparatus used for the experiment</heading><list>Three metal discs of different sizesA standPiece of stringA threaded metal rod with a winder (fitted to the stand)Electronic stopwatchSeveral masses(0.1 kg, 0.02 kg and 0.05 kg)A screw nut and a metal bush to fix the discs to the threaded metal rodA metre ruler </list><heading>Method used</heading>According to the derived equation  FORMULA  the unknowns are I, s, r and t. The experiment was used to find the values for the time 't' for the masses to reach from the top of the stand(from the metal threaded rod) to the bench. First, one of the discs (small disc was fitted first) was fixed to the threaded metal rod at the top of the stand using the metal bush and the screw nut. Then a mass of 0.1 kg was fitted at the end of the string provided and was fixed to the threaded metal rod. This string was then revolved along the threads of the metal rod so the hung mass reached the top of the stand. Then the metal rod was released for the mass to unwind down towards the bench. The time taken for the mass to reach from the top of the stand (from the metal rod) to the surface of the bench was then measured using the stopwatch. Five readings were taken for each mass (masses used: 0.1, 0.12, 0.17 and 0.22 kg) with each disc. The measurements taken were reasonably accurate since one person was in charge of the mechanical parts and the other was in charge of the timings (stopwatch). Another unknown in the equation derived is the distance  's'. This was found by measuring the height between the surface of the bench and the centre of the threaded metal rod using the metre ruler provided. The other unknown required would be the radius of the metal rod 'r'. The thread provided was used to measure the circumference of the metal rod and the calculation mentioned below was carried out;  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  After all the readings were taken,  FORMULA  values for the maximum and minimum timings for each disc with different masses were found. Then a maximum and minimum graph of mass  'm' versus  FORMULA  were plotted for each disc. Therefore the gradient of the graphs would be  FORMULA  which is equal to  FORMULA .  FORMULA   FORMULA  Therefore;  FORMULA  <picture/>Above shows a simplified version of the stand and the metal rod system used. <heading>4.0 Results and possible errors</heading><heading>Results</heading>The distance 's', the height between the surface of the bench and the centre of the threaded metal rod (the metre ruler used for measurements had an accuracy of 0.001m) ;  FORMULA  The radius 'r', radius of the threaded metal rod (the metal ruler used for the measurement of the thread had an accuracy of 0.0005m) ;  FORMULA  The time 't', table of times taken for the masses to reach from the top of the stand(from the metal threaded rod) to the surface of the bench(a distance of 0.32m; the stopwatch used had an accuracy of 0.01s) ; <table/><heading>Possible errors</heading>The reasons mentioned could result in any errors occurred when taking the readings. Time error - human errors which could occur when dealing timing equipment. Friction - there could be friction in the apparatus used such as the threaded metal rod. Inertia of the system - there is inertia of the system which is not considered. Air friction - there is air resistance because of the air present around the experiment area. Values of mass - the values of the masses considered in the calculations could be slightly different to the actual value. <heading>5.0 Calculations, Analysis and Interpretation of the results </heading>For the graphs to be sketched the  FORMULA  value was required, the table below shows the  FORMULA  values for the maximum and minimum timings for each disc; <table/>Then two graphs (a maximum timings graph and a minimum timings graph) of mass  'm' versus  FORMULA  are plotted for each disc; The graphs of small disc; <figure/><figure/>The graphs of medium disc; <figure/><figure/>The graphs of Large disc; <figure/><figure/>Then the gradients ( FORMULA ) of each line (min and max) was found which is equal to  FORMULA . <list> 1.)

All the graphs plotted have a similar linear shape with most points fitting close to the best fit lines with a few deviated points.
