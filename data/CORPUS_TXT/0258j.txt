<heading>Section 1: Introduction</heading>Aimil Pharmaceuticals is one of the leading herbal medicines manufacturing company in India. The firm manufactures various kinds of herbal medicines distributed in northern region of India. The firm is mainly based in New Delhi, Capital city of India with few plant and offices in regions outside New Delhi. At their New Delhi plant, the firm manufactures large amount of medicines everyday. The medicines are manufactured by combining various herbs, which are being collected from various sources from in and outside New Delhi. In this assignment, we shall try to simulate one of their manufacturing plants based in New Delhi and solve some of the issues concerning the efficiency of the plant. <heading>Section 2: Problem</heading>Each plant site manufactures medicine for certain regions of India. The plant based in New Delhi, mainly covers areas around Delhi. The plant operates from 8am till 6pm every day, 7 days a week. In order to manufacture the medicines, raw material which are the herbs are needed. The company have contacts with four different vendors who provide all the herbs. The herbs collected from one vendor are only used for making one kind of medicine. The lorries leave the plant at 8am in the morning to collect the herbs from four different vendors located on nearly equal distance from the plant. The plant has 20 different Lorries of different sizes used in bringing all the raw materials required. The Lorries leave the plant site at 8am to collect the herbs in the following manner: 1. Five Grey Coloured Lorries go to Vendor I and do two runs a day to that Vendor plant to collect the herbs, they leave the plant site second. 2. Five Blue Coloured Lorries go to Vendor II and do two runs a day to that Vendor plant to collect the herbs; they leave the plant site third. 3. Five Black Coloured Lorries go to Vendor III and do two runs a day to that Vendor plant to collect the herbs, they leave the plant site fourth. 4. Five Brown Coloured Lorries go to Vendor IV and do three runs a day to that Vendor plant to collect the herbs; they leave the plant site first. The size of Grey, Blue and Black Lorries are same 9,000 kg where as the size of Brown Lorries are 14,000 kg. All the Lorries leaves through the exit gates, where they have to stop and get a clearance form from security When the Lorries arrive after their visit, they must stop at the Entrance Gate and driver have to provide the signed documents by the Vendor which are kept for record purposes. The next stage involves proceeding to the weighbridge area only if it is available else they have to wait in the queue designed to wait before moving onto weighbridge. If no spaces are available the lorry has to wait at the Entrance. After the weighing process is finished the lorry moves to the next point that is the stock check-in area. At present, there are three stock check-in-area points present, whose duty is to check all the material. The Lorries can take any one of three available points to get the goods checked. If no point is free, then the lorry has to wait in a queue for the check-in-area. After receiving the satisfactory check letter, the final stage is the off-loading stage. There are three off-loading bays designed to transfer all the material in quickest possible way. The lorry proceeds to one of the three offloading bays. If no bay is vacant they lorry have to wait in the queue. After off-loading all the material, the lorries either leave again for the next trip (They would leave through the exit gates and if its busy they would have to wait in a queue) or if its their list trip they move to final point which is the washing Zone. If the washing Zone is busy they would have to wait in Queue until they get any free available point. After washing the lorries are parked in the parking Zone. The layout of the plant is in such a way that it allows up to maximum of 10 lorries in a queue except the queue for the entrance which could usually have any number of lorries because its outside the plant area. The biggest congestion is seen during the timing around 10:30 am at the weighbridge zone and check-in points. The management has plans to add some extra check-in points and some offloading points in order to enable all lorries to finish their work by 4:30 pm. Under current operation the lorries usually finish by about 5:30 pm. <heading>Section 3: Objectives</heading>The motivation to do this project came from personally worked in the firm as Software Development trainee and knowing the problem they were facing at their north Delhi plant. Office Address:2994/4, Street No. 17 Ranjeet NagarNew Delhi-110008 India Office Phone:91-11-5701203, 5703041 Website:  URL  The objective is to determine the number of check-in points and off-loading points required so that all lorries finish their tasks by 5pm. The maximum number of check-in and off-loading points allowed is 5. (Conceptual model development is an iterative process. All aspects of the model were continuously refined (including objectives). The report presents the final version of the model.) The main report is 14 pages with 10 pages of appendices. <heading>Section 4: Flow Diagram</heading><figure/><heading>Section 5: Assumptions </heading>The lorries arrive full. Lorries are never refused at Entry or Exit points. The check-in of the material is always satisfactory. Every operation point has only one dedicated worker. The capacity of the queue is more than the actual number of lorries plant have. There are no breakdowns of the equipments or lorries. Data obtained on time it takes to travel to respective vendor and back to the plant are sufficiently accurate for the problem. Data obtained on time to perform the operations at the plant are sufficiently accurate for the problem. Travel time from Parking Zone to Exit Zone and Off-loading Zone to Exit Zone are equal. <heading>Section 6: Simplifications</heading>Operation of only one day is being modelled in this project because the amount of work, vendors, and pattern of work does not change on day-by-day basis. The breaks taken by the staff member is not modelled in this project. In real life scenario the staff takes a break when their work centres are usually waiting for operation. Travel time vary very little, so fixed values are being used to represent travel times between various activities. <heading>Section 7: Model Input and Output</heading><heading>7.1  Experimental Factor</heading><list>Number of Check-in points (Range: 3,4,5)Number of offloading points (Range: 3,4,5)</list><heading>7.2  Response to determine achievement of the objectives</heading>Time spent at work (From 9am) by the lorry that finishes it work last (it should be less then 510 minutes) <heading>7.3  Response to determine reasons for failure to meet objectives</heading><list>Queue sizes (Average, Minimum, Maximum) for all operational processes.Queuing times (Average, Minimum, Maximum, Standard Deviation) for all operational processes.Time-series of queue sizes by hour of queues for all operational processes.Percentage of time that operational processes are waiting for work or blocked.</list><heading>Section 8: Model Content</heading><heading>8.1  Model Scope</heading>Lorries are included as a flow through the operational processes. All operational processes are essential to be modelled as they all effect the time lorries spend at the yard (Number of check-in points and offloading points are experimental factor in this project) Queues for all operational processes are modelled as their statistics serve as responses to determine reasons for failure. Operational processes include Entrance Gate, Exit Gate, Weigh Bridge Zone, Check-in Zone, Offloading Zone and Washing Zone. Operational processes at the Vendors site are not modelled in this project as they are independent businesses and management of Aimil Pharmaceuticals has no authorisation to change their operations for personal benefits. Travelling to Vendors site and returning to the farm is modelled by creating a dummy work centre "Vendors". It has 20 replications (for 20 lorries) as all lorries travel at the same time. <heading>8.2  Model Level of Details</heading><table/><heading>Section 9: Model Data</heading>Empirical Data are presented in the Appendix, page 20. Stat::Fit was used to fit automatically analytical distributions into gathered data. The analytical distributions for each operations processes times where chosen by analysing the Stat::Fit summary of statistics, parameters estimates and most importantly goodness of fit tests and by comparing between the estimated distribution and the input data. Distribution Viewer of Stat::Fit was used to calculate mean and SD. <heading>9.1  Number of Lorries</heading>The total numbers of lorries available are 20 and the lorries are being divided in 4 groups of 5. Each group has its own destination, selection from one of the Vendors that is already being decided. Lorries in Group I have size of 14000 kg and leave the plant site first as compared to other group lorries. <heading>9.2  Parking</heading>It can accommodate all 20 lorries. <heading>9.3  Entrance Gate</heading>Number of Entrance Gate is only 1 and time taken to travel from entrance gate to weigh bridge is about 3 minutes. <table/><heading>9.4  Weigh Bridge</heading>Number of weighbridges present on the site is 1. Travel time from weigh bridge to check-in point is 2 minutes. <table/><heading>9.5  Check in Point</heading>Number of check-in points available in check-in Zone are 3. Travel time to the offloading zone is 2 minutes. <table/><heading>9.6  Offloading Points</heading>Number of offloading points is 3. The time taken from offloading points to washing points is approximately 4 minutes. <table/><table/><heading>9.7  Washing Points</heading>Number of washing points on the site are 3. Travel time to the parking area is approximately 5 minutes. <table/><heading>9.8  Exit Gate</heading>Number of Exit Gates is only 1. <table/><heading>9.9  Vendors</heading>Number of Replications: 20 <table/><table/><table/><table/><heading>Section 10: Verification and Validation</heading>Verification and validation of model has been important part of this problem. Verification has been performed continuously in the model in order to obtain accurate model. In most cases comparing the computer model results with the conceptual model does it. <heading>10.1 Data Validation</heading>The empirical data were analysed for any inconsistencies present. The graphs were drawn to examine patterns. <heading>10.2 White-Box Validation</heading>Various methods has been used in the implementation of white box validation as suggested during the course lectures and from prescribed course book. The model was examined step by step to better examine various activities. The model was run often at slow speed to see how each entity behaved and if it resembled the real-life situation and in most of the cases it did. The arrival rate of the lorries arriving at the plant were increased to a maximum by setting times to travel to vendors to the same fixed values. The expected results where found that queues were built at the entrance gate as all lorries arrived at the nearly same timing. The timing for check-in and offloading points where set to extreme points to view the behaviour. And it resulted in building of queues at both the points which was expected result. <heading>10.3 Black-Box Validation</heading>Deterministic Test The model has been simplified to the extent that the mathematical model could predict exactly the outcome of the model. In order to achieve this, all the random elements of the model were removed and instead the mean value of each distribution was substituted to analyse the results. In this scenario the lorries only did one run. By simplifying it was possible to calculate the amount of time each lorry would take and compare it to the results given by the model. Table 2 shows the calculated time at which tanker appears at the particular work centre. Table 2 calculations were done in Excel. In order to infer that the model behaved as expected, the final values in the table 1 where compared to the values in Table 2. Table 2 values are being generated by the simul8. And as we can see from the data both the values matches exactly, which proved that the model is behaving as expected. The deterministic test showed an exact correspondence between the deterministic model and calculated results. <table/><table/><heading>Section 11: Experimentation</heading><heading>11.1Nature of Simulation Model</heading>The model that has been implemented in this assignment is a termination simulation. In this problem there is an end point present, as the plant closes every evening at 6pm. This means all the operational activities in the plant has to be completed before this time. The termination point is after one whole day of activity which is for period of 10 hours. <heading>11.2 Nature of Simulation Model Output</heading>The output from the model is expected to be transient as there is no steady state pattern present in the simulation. This is due to the fact that it takes different time to travel to each vendor and bring the raw material needed to manufacture medicines. There is also transient result because different lorries do different number of runs based on the Vendor they are bringing goods from. <heading>11.3 Initialisation Bias</heading>The simulation starts and returns to an empty state. Each day the lorries leave in the parking zone in the morning to bring raw material from different vendors, so at that time the plant is empty. At the end of the day all lorries going through the washing zone before they are parked into the parking zone and the plant state is empty. The model starts with initial condition of no lorries in the plant. <heading>11.4 Comparing Data</heading>While comparing alternative solutions to the problem there are limited numbers of scenarios that need to be considered in the experimentation part of the assignment. These scenarios were known at the start of the project. It's given that plant can increase its number of offloading and check-in points to a maximum of five each. At present, there are three points for each of the activity. Having maximum of five points each means there are 9 different combination which could be possible and our aim is to find the combination which best solves the problem. The table below shows the various combinations that could be possible. <table/><figure/><table/>In order to select the best solution, Common Random numbers are being used in the model, a confidence interval for the difference between the results of each possible combination of scenario has been compared using the Paired T-Approach. The comparison between the scenarios using the Paired T- Approach and resulting confidence interval in each cases led to one of three outcomes as shown in figure Outcome (a): The confidence interval is completely to the left of Zero. It can be concluded, with 95% level of confidence that the result of first Scenario is less then the result of second Scenario. Outcome (b): The confidence interval includes Zero. It can be concluded, with 95% level of confidence that the result of first Scenario is not significantly different from the result of second Scenario. Outcome (c): The confidence interval is completely to the right of Zero. It can be concluded, with 95% level of confidence that the result of first Scenario is greater then the result of second Scenario. <figure/>Table 19,20,21,22,23,24 shows a paired-t confidence interval for each combination of two scenarios simulated with in the model. Common random numbers are implemented in this model. The results in the tables show the amount of time spent in the system (in minutes) for twenty replications. In scenario 9 five check-in points and offloading points are available in the model. As we can see from those tables that the confidence interval is a long way to the right of zero this gives a lot of confidence that the results from Scenario 5,6,8 is greater than result from Scenario 9. The aim of the model is to reduce the amount of time spent that infers that Scenario 9 is preferred when compared to other scenarios.. The same technique was used to identify the next possible solution in terms of gaining understanding from the confidence interval in all scenario comparisons. <heading>11.5 Comparison of many scenarios</heading>The paired-t confidence interval is being extended to enable more than two scenarios to be compared at once by the use of the Bonferroni inequality. In each of the possible scenario 25 replications has been run and output data from the initial transient has been deleted. Common random numbers have again been employed. The results for the mean time in the system are shown in Table 1.5. From the results we can see that there are four possible scenarios which actually fulfil the objective of this project to reduce the amount of time spent in the plant to less then 510 minutes. All other scenarios takes more then 510 minutes and hence they will not be included in the next process of comparing each scenario to another. <table/>So next stage was to compare each of the 4 possible scenarios to each other and see which offered the best solution. <table/>Conclusion from Confidence Interval Comparison between all selected scenarios for the Aimil Plant Model. <table/><heading>11.6 Choosing the best scenario</heading>Beyond comparing scenarios, there is an obvious interest in identifying the best out of all of these selected scenarios. At the simplest level this could have been achieved by examining the mean time spent in the system in each scenario. In this model and as we can see from Table X Scenario 9 gives the minimum result for the mean time in the system, so this appears to be best solution. Of course, simply comparing point estimates does not take account of the standard deviation of the results or the number of replications performed. It was therefore better to refer also to the confidence interval. In table 1.7 it can be seen clearly that Scenario 9 is in all cases better then any other scenario. That is, there is significant difference and the mean time in the system is lower for Scenario 9 . It is apparent that next best solutions are Scenario 8 and Scenario 6. <heading>11.7 Conclusion</heading>The paired-t confidence intervals helped in identifying the statistical significance of the difference in the result. There are other factors that are normally included in the final decision such as cost of implementing the changes. This report will give the firm an estimate of time spent each day in plant by changing the number of work centres. After doing all the experimentation I can recommend that: In order to achieve the aim of finishing the work by 4:30 every day the firm needs to install at least 4 offloading and 4 check-in points Scenario 9 that includes installation of 5 offloading and check-in points gives the least time spent in the system. Scenario 6 or Scenario 8 offers nearly same result so by either having 4 offloading and 5 check-in or 5 offloading and 4 check-in points the objective will be met but not better then Scenario 9. In case the firm don't have enough budgets to implement the change, Scenario 5 would be the most appropriate solution of having four each of offloading and check-in points. The firm can also design a similar simulation by viewing the results of the number of weighbridge points are increased from one to some other number.
