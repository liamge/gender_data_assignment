<heading>The right to silence; myth or reality? Discuss</heading><heading>Introduction</heading>Traditionally the right to silence has been known as one of the fundamental pillars of the legal system, working alongside the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof to protect suspects' rights within the criminal justice system. However reforms to the law have sought to alter this principle to the extent that the question has to be asked whether the right to silence still exists within the modern English legal system. To place the question within its context, I shall briefly explain what the right to silence is; its origins and history and its place within the legal system. This essay shall have two primary objectives; firstly to engage with the right to silence debate, analysing some of the better known theories and questioning whether there should be a right to silence. Secondly, examining the current legislation and case law and discovering whether the right to silence currently exists within the modern English legal system. In order to answer this I shall begin by examining the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1984 and the subsequent case law upon the practice of law. I have also conducted interviews with both a police officer and a criminal solicitor and hope to use this evidence to provide an insight into the practical use of the right to silence within the trial process. In doing so I hope to analyse its impact both pre-trial and within court and discover whether the right to silence still remains albeit in a modern altered form, or whether it has been removed through reform and merely exists in name only, as a shadow of its former self.  <fnote>With particular emphasis on the cases from the European Court of Human Rights. </fnote><fnote>Interview with John Cardiff, a current prosecutor for Warwickshire CPS </fnote><fnote>Interview with David Coyle, a current defence solicitor for Sarginson Hughes & Masser </fnote><heading>What is the right to silence? </heading><quote>"nemo tenetur seipsum accusare" </quote><fnote>"No man is bound to accuse himself" </fnote>The right to silence is embedded within the foundations of the legal system that a suspect has the right not to answer any questions if they so wish and that no adverse inferences shall be drawn against them. The authority for the principle was stated by Lord Parker CJ "...though every citizen has a moral duty, or if you like a social duty to assist the police, there is no legal duty to that effect.... The whole basis of the common law is that right of the individual not to answer questions put to him by a person of authority." <fnote>Rice v Connolly [1966] 2 All QB 414 </fnote>The principle of is one of fundamental importance to the adversarial criminal justice system, that it is the prosecutions duty to satisfy the burden of proof, so much so that Lord Sankey LC declared "no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained." This is an argument that has been strongly argued by Dennis, that the burden of proof is entwined with the presumption of innocence that every person charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. <fnote>Woolmington v DPP (1935) AC 462 </fnote><fnote>Greenacre (1837) 8 C&P 35 </fnote><fnote>I.Dennis "Reverse onuses and the Presumption of Innocence: In search of principle" (2005) Crim LR </fnote><fnote>Article 6.2 European Convention on Human Rights </fnote>It should be remembered that the right to silence is perhaps better interpreted as the "privilege against self-incrimination" as it is the freedom not to divulge incriminating information, resulting in no adverse consequences that is so fundamental to the right to silence, rather than simply the act of silence itself. <fnote>Greer, 1990; Easton, 1991 taken from Home Office Research Study 199, The right of silence: the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 by Tom Bucke, Robert Street and David Brown </fnote><fnote>Home Office Research Study 199, The right of silence: the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 by Tom Bucke, Robert Street and David Brown </fnote>It would be misleading to suggest that the right to silence has always been absolute as this has not been case. Lord Atkinson stated that the jury may interpret an "acceptance "of the allegation through a suspects silence and Lord Parker CJ stated that that a judge may remind a jury of a defendant's failure to give a statement or allow cross-examination. It should also be remembered that there is nothing to prevent a magistrate or jury from treating silence as guilt regardless of directions from the judge. However in principle the right to silence remained intact until the creation of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, forming the basis of the current law, arguably destroying the right to silence and eroding the principle of the presumption of innocence. <fnote>Christie [1914] AC 545 </fnote><fnote>Bathurst [1968] 2 QB 107 </fnote><fnote>The Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure (1981 B), para 83 taken from Leng, Roger: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: The Right to Silence in police Interrogation: A study of some of the Issues Underlying the Debate, Research Study No.10, 1993 </fnote><heading>Should there be a right to silence? </heading>There was a vast amount of debate surrounding the right to silence prior to the creation of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and this has continued since. Prior to the act four bodies investigated the debate; the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1972, the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure in 1981, the Home Office Working Group on the Right to Silence in 1989 and the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice in 1993. These investigations considered both the theoretical debate and practical implications of a change in the law. I shall use the findings from these bodies and the resulting academic debate as a foundation for my questioning of the importance of the right to silence. <fnote>S. Easton, The case for the right to silence (2nd Edition 1998) Ch 2 </fnote><fnote>Criminal Law revision Committee, Eleventh Report: Evidence (General) (Cmnd 4991) (1972) </fnote><fnote>Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure, Report (Cmnd 8092) (1981) </fnote><fnote>Report of the Working Group on the Right to Silence (1989) </fnote><fnote>Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, Report (Cm 2263) (1993) also known as the Runciman Commission </fnote>As mentioned earlier, the very basis of the right to silence is that it is a basic constitutional right of the individual not to have to answer questions and for no adverse inferences to be drawn through their refusal. It is the principle that the right to silence is intrinsically entwined within the principles of the burden of proof and presumption of innocence and that an attack on the right to silence represents an attack upon the most basic principles of justice of the criminal justice system. However beyond this basic constitutional right, there are four topics of contention regarding the right to silence. <fnote>Rice v Connolly [1966] 2 All QB 414 </fnote><heading>Silence as Guilt </heading>The philosophy behind the abolition of the right to silence is based upon the presumption that silence is evidence is of guilt. Bentham who provided the basis for this philosophy described it as "innocence claims the right of speaking, as guilt invokes the privilege of silence". In simple terms this is the basic philosophy that only the guilty have anything to hide and thus the right to silence is merely a protection for the guilty. <fnote>J . Bentham, Treatise on Evidence, p 241. Taken from Greer, Stephen: The Right to Silence: A Review of the Current Debate, The Modern Law Review, Vol. 53, No. 6. (Nov., 1990), pp. 709-730. </fnote><fnote>An argument supported by the 1987 Home Secretary. Mr Douglas Hurd who asked the rhetorical question: "does the present law really protect the innocent whose interests will generally lie in answering police questions frankly?" M. Zander, Cases and Materials on the English Legal System (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. 5th ed, 1988) p 147. Taken from Greer, Stephen: The Right to Silence: A Review of the Current Debate, The Modern Law Review, Vol. 53, No. 6. (Nov., 1990), pp. 709-730. </fnote>The widely held view is that this is not the case and that there are numerous possible factors which may result in a suspects silence at interview such as "fear, anxiety, confusion, the desire to protect someone else, embarrassment, outrage or anger." As such it would be wrong to assume that all silence is a reflection of guilt, when any of the above emotions, reflected through silence, may be a rational response within the circumstances. Furthermore creating a situation where it is a disadvantage to a suspect's case to remain silent creates a pressure to speak, regardless of innocence or guilt, creating the potential for a suspect to incriminate himself and increasing the probability of creating unreliable evidence. <fnote>S.Easton, 'Legal Advice, Common Sense and the Right to Silence' (1998) 2 International Journal of Evidence and Prof 109, 114-115.

Regardless of whether this is true, it is argued that it this should not even be considered, as is not within the nature of the adversarial criminal process for a suspect to aid the investigative procedure. In the trial of Dr Bodkin Adams, Devlin J explained this succinctly and poetically in his summing up to the jury: <fnote>In light of the earlier discussion regarding ambush defences I would suggest that it is not. </fnote><quote>"The law on this matter reflects the natural thought of England. So great is and always has been our horror at the idea that a man might be questioned, forced to speak and perhaps condemn himself out of his own mouth that we grant everyone suspected or accused of crime at the beginning, at every stage and until the very end to say: "Ask me no questions. I shall answer none. Prove your case".' </quote><fnote>Patrick Devlin, Easing the Passing (1985, Oxford), p176 taken from Munday, Roderick: Evidence, Oxford University Press, Third Edition, 2005, P497 </fnote>Therefore it appears to be a completely unjust expectation to require a suspect to potentially incriminate themselves, when it is not required within the adversarial system within which we live. <fnote>An argument shared by Zander in his "Note of Dissent" RCCJ Report 1993, p221: "Defence disclosure (or being pressured to speak or give evidence) is designed ot be helpful to the prosecution, and more generally to the system, But it is not the job of the defendant to be helpful to either the prosecution or to the system. His task, if he chooses to put the prosecution to proof is simply to defend himself." </fnote><heading>Ambush Defences </heading>The most quoted argument condemning the right to silence is that it creates an incentive to mount ambush defences. There is much academic debate as to what extent ambush defences are used within the criminal process, partly due to the wide ranging differences in definition of an "ambush defence". The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice defined it as having the following features; raising a defence for the first time in court, to which the prosecution have had no notice, taking the prosecution by surprise and depriving them of the opportunity to investigate and refute the defence. I have discussed the morality of such defences in my analysis of the criminal process, however regardless of morality there remains great division as to the impact of ambush defences. The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice found that ambush defences were raised only in the minority of cases, and even then most ended in conviction. Studies have estimated the use of ambush defences as high as 7-10% or even as low as 1.5-5%. During his study Leng found that often unanticipated defences created a greater problem for the prosecution, perhaps due to the nature of the adversarial system and as a result of poor police interrogation technique, rather than an attempt to withhold evidence. As such it appears illogical that ambush defences are accused of causing such a significant problem within the criminal justice system. Furthermore it has been suggested that the problem of ambush defences had been exaggerated simply to secure the passage of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. <fnote>Leng, Roger: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: The Right to Silence in police Interrogation: A study of some of the Issues Underlying the Debate, Research Study No.10, 1993 </fnote><fnote>Zander and Henderson's (1993) Crown Court study taken from Home Office Research Study 199, The right of silence: The impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 by Tom Bucke, Robert Street and David Brown </fnote><fnote>Leng, Roger: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: The Right to Silence in police Interrogation: A study of some of the Issues Underlying the Debate, Research Study No.10, 1993 </fnote><fnote>Home Office Research Study 199, The right of silence: The impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 byTom Bucke, Robert Street and David Brown </fnote>In addition it has been argued that the implementation of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 has further reduced the danger of ambush defences. The Act requires that in certain circumstances, following disclosure from the prosecution, the defence be required to set out the nature of the accussed's defence and failure to do so may result in inferences being drawn. The significance of this legislation is that it allows a retention of the right to silence, only forcing the suspect to comment once they have been made aware of the prosecution case against them. <fnote>s. 5 Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 </fnote><fnote>s. 11 Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 </fnote><heading>Convictions </heading>Finally there remains the issue of convictions, which can be separated into two interesting questions, firstly whether an erosion of the right to silence will lead to further convictions and secondly even if it does whether this is an appropriate reason to abolish the right. There is an assumption that the removal of the right to silence shall automatically result in an increase in convictions; however there appears to be little evidence to support this claim. Results have varied when estimating how often silence is used within interviews, prior to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994; estimates were between 5% and 22%. Research has shown since the implementation of the Act that there has been a reduction in the use of the right to silence, this is a view shared by a current defence solicitor who claims that the right is rarely used at all, if ever. It has been suggested that rather than providing further reliable evidence conducive to aiding an investigation, there is a tendency for suspects to create falsified unreliable evidence instead.  <fnote>Leng, Roger: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: The Right to Silence in police Interrogation: A study of some of the Issues Underlying the Debate, Research Study No.10, 1993 </fnote><fnote>Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) taken from Home Office Research Study 199, The right of silence: the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, byTom Bucke, Robert Street and David Brown </fnote><fnote>Interview with David Coyle, a current defence solicitor for Sarginson Hughes & Masser </fnote><fnote>ibid </fnote>With regard to the investigative nature of the right to silence, the RCCJ discovered that often a detainee's denial is more effective in impeding a police investigation than the right to silence. In only 5% of the cases where the police tried to break down a negative response did they succeed. <fnote>Leng, Roger: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: The Right to Silence in police Interrogation: A study of some of the Issues Underlying the Debate, Research Study No.10, 1993 </fnote>Research surrounding the impact of CJPOA has actually demonstrated a reduction in the number of suspects charged, demonstrating that although fewer suspects are able to exercise their right to silence, it is not resulting in an increase charges, again questioning the theories supporting the abolition of the right to silence. <fnote>Table 3.7 Case outcome by exercise of the right of silence taken from Bucke, Street and Brown: The right of silence: The impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Home Office Research Study 199 P41 </fnote>Finally there remains the question of even if the CJPOA does increase convictions, whether this is an appropriate reason to abolish to right to silence. Removing the right to silence to increase convictions is an argument based within the Crime Control position; a position assumed by the Runciman Commission that "convicting the guilty is of equal importance to acquitting the innocent." However this can surely not remain the case when doing so involves the elimination of a fundamental principle of justice. It could be argued that it would be possible to increase convictions through the removal of the right to legal advice; however this would not even be considered as it is a fundamental principle of justice. I see no difference with the removal of the right to silence. The effect of convictions should almost be considered irrelevant, as it is not a matter of how many convictions, but how many safe convictions and if the removal of the right to silence will in any way further the chances of innocent people being convicted then it should not even be considered. <fnote>Packer, The Limits of The Criminal Sanction, Oxford University Press, 1969 </fnote><fnote>The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: A Confidence Trick? Young and Sanders, Oxford University Press 1994 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies Val 14, No 3 </fnote>Having examined the arguments for and against the right to silence, there appears to be no sufficiently justifiable reason for the abolition of the right. The use of silence as evidence of guilt has been shown to be an antiquated fallacy and the use of ambush defences has been shown to be in a minority of cases which have little impact of the outcome of the investigation. Furthermore the overriding belief that drawing inferences will lead to further convictions has also been shown to be an inaccurate assumption, neglecting the moral consequences of the right. Thus with the theories supporting the abolition of the right to silence being demonstrated as fundamentally flawed, there is no justification for overturning the principles of justice of the presumption of innocence and the constitutional values of the criminal process. <heading>Does the right to silence exist? </heading>Having concluded that the right to silence is a fundamental protection within the criminal process, the question remains whether the right to silence still exists and if so in what capacity, following the implementation of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. I shall examine this question through an analysis of s.34 of the Act and the resulting case law and the European Court of Human Rights to discover its impact upon right to silence. <heading>Criminal Justice & Public Order Act s.34</heading>The provisions of the Act state that a suspects failure to mention facts when questioned or charged and reliance upon those facts, (a fact being something that the defendant could reasonably have been expected to mention) the court may draw such inferences as appear proper. In order to examine to what extent there has been an erosion of the right to silence, it ought to be considered when an inference may be drawn and to what effect. The first requirement for an adverse inference to be drawn under s.34 is that the fact relied upon is one which the suspect "could reasonably have been expected to mention". Although this appears straightforward it creates ambiguities as to when it is deemed "reasonable" to mention a fact. In doing so the jury are expected to consider whether the fact in question was known at the time of interview and whether its significance was appreciated. If there is no proof that this was the case it would be unconscionable to direct a jury to consider drawing an adverse inference. Such is the complexity of a decision that it is been argued that it is beyond the competence and constitutional role of the jury. Analysing it in practical terms the direction to the jury in the case of Argent included such a list of possibilities for the jury to consider that it is near impossible to decide what circumstances could justify silence. <fnote>Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 s.1 (b) </fnote><fnote>B (MT) [2000] Crim LR 181 taken from Leng, Roger: Silence pre-trial, reasonable expectations and the normative distortion of fact finding [2001] 5 E&P </fnote><fnote>Leng, Roger: Silence pre-trial, reasonable expectations and the normative distortion of fact finding [2001] 5 E&P </fnote><fnote>Argent [1997] 2 Cr App R 27, CA </fnote>Secondly there is the question of what constitutes a "fact" and whether it was relied upon within the suspects defence. He definition of a fact has been given a wide discretion, in Milford Potter LJ suggested that a fact is a "particular truth known by actual observation or authentic testimony, as opposed to what is merely inferred, or to a conjecture or to fiction."Thus in rather complicated definition a fact is not simply a matter of what has happened and yet is not a speculative explanation or an allegation but is an asserted fact or explanation for ones behaviour. <fnote>Milford [2001] Crim LR 330 </fnote><fnote>Nickolson [1999] Crim LR 181 </fnote><fnote>B(MT) [2000] Crim LR 181 </fnote>In keeping with the wide definition of a fact, there is similarly a wide interpretation of when it has been relied upon. In Webber it was held that a defendant relies on a fact when counsel puts an argument to a witness, even if that witness rejects the argument being put forward. Thus proving a difficult test to overcome. However there is some leniency in the fact that if a defendant refuses to respond to evidence at all, then no adverse inferences can be drawn against him. If this weren't the case then it would constitute a flagrant breach of Article 6 right to silence, the same is true of a bare admission of the prosecution case. <fnote>R v Webber [2004] 1 WLR 404 </fnote><heading>The European Court of Human Rights</heading>The right to silence is not specifically incorporated within the ECHR; however it was believed to be implicitly contained within the Article 6 right to a fair trial. The ECHR was first asked to consider the compatibility of drawing adverse inferences from pre-trial silence with Article 6 in the case of Murray v UK. In summary it was decided that a court may take into account a defendants pre-trial silence provided there is a balance between the exercise of the right to silence and the circumstances in which an adverse inference may be drawn. Following this case there was some speculation that this was only applicable in a diplock trial and that the court may take a different approach in a jury trial. This was considered in the case of Condron where the court decided that although the direction from the judge was inadequate, but that if the direction had been right, there is no reason why a jury would not have been capable of deciding upon the case. Therefore virtually eliminating the possibility that the CJPOA will be declared incompatible with the convention. In essence this effectively leaves the right to silence in difficult position. <fnote>Right to a fair trial </fnote><fnote>Murray v UK (1996) 22 EHRR 29 </fnote><fnote>The case of Murray involved the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 and was thus related to a Diplock trial; trial by judge with no jury </fnote><fnote>Condron v UK [2000] Crim LR 679 </fnote><heading>The Effect of s.34 </heading>Having examined s.34 it can undoubtedly be seen that the Act has created a severe erosion of the right to silence. The Act has left limited circumstances in which it is acceptable to remain silent; creating a strict interpretation of what constitutes a fact and a wide interpretation as to when a fact is relied upon. The ECHR has examined the right to silence, declaring it a "qualified or restricted right" and holding the CJPOA to be compatible with Article 6 as long as the judge directs the jury to only draw adverse inferences if satisfied the suspects silence could only be attributed to their having no answer. It is suggested that although s.34 does not create a legal duty to speak, it shall undoubtedly place further pressure upon a suspect to speak, arguably creating an "inchoate norm" to that effect. The impact of the Act upon convictions isn't yet known, however Leng argues that such is the undeniably complex nature of silence and the reasons behind it, within a proper interpretation of the law inferences should very rarely be drawn. Furthermore when inferences are drawn it should be questioned whether juries have done so for the correct reasons. <fnote>The term `inchoate norm' is used here to describe a norm which is widely accepted although uncertain in scope, which is subject to no formal sanction for breach, but for which breach is routinely subjected to an informal and indirect sanction. </fnote><fnote>Paragraph paraphrased from Leng, Roger: Silence pre-trial, reasonable expectations and the normative distortion of fact finding [2001] 5 E&P </fnote>Looking to the future it has already been suggested that the legislation be repealed on a cost-benefit basis and it has even been suggested by Hedley J that prosecutors should be discouraged from using the Act for fear of "..... further complicating trials and summing-up by invoking this statute unless the merits of the individual case require that his should be done." The endorsement of the Act by the ECHR and the long struggle for its inclusion has rendered it unlikely that the act will be repealed. When drawing conclusions as to whether the right to silence still exists, it is clear to see that in technical terms the right still has effectively been removed by the CJPOA, however due to its complex nature is difficult to put into practice. <fnote>"The choice will be between tinkering with section 34 so as to reduce its impact, or giving up the ghost and reverting to the common law rule. It is hoped that this survey of the existing law has gone some way to convincing readers that there is nothing significant to be lost, and much to be gained, were we to adopt the latter course." D.

The arguments of silence as guilt, ambush defences and the need to secure convictions are counter balanced and surpassed by the principals' constitutional and moral legitimacy. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that the right in practice has little effect on the prosecutions investigative abilities and its impact exaggerated. Overall demonstrating there is insufficient evidence to justify its abolition. In questioning whether the right still exists, the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 has left the right to silence as a shadow of its former self. Technically suspects are still privileged with the right to remain silent, there is no legal duty to answer questions, although in reality this now means very little. A suspect exercising their right to remain silent during interview and in court will be subject to the court drawing inferences as to the subjects guilt and thus eliminating the very protection the right to silence is intended provide. Even the European Court of Human Rights appears to have turned its back on the right to silence. Thus it can be seen the future of the right to silence looks bleak. Contemporary society is moving towards a model of crime control, with the protections of presumption of innocence and burden of proof increasingly being eroded. Previous legislation such as the Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order (1988), the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and more recently the Terrorist Acts all reflect this trend. It is ironic that in these times of political instability that the safeguards of due process are needed the most. This includes the right to silence, as argued by Greer "The right to silence should not merely remain a vital part of the criminal justice system of England and Wales; it should be strengthened". Unfortunately in the current political climate, this is unlikely to happen. <fnote>Packer, The Limits of The Criminal Sanction, Oxford University Press, 1969 </fnote><fnote>Terrorism Act 2000, Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 and Terrorism Act 2006 </fnote><fnote>Steven Greer, The Right to Silence: A Review of the Current Debate, The Modern Law Review 53:6 November 1990 0026-7961 </fnote><heading>Research Memorandum</heading>I have chosen to write my essay on the right to silence as I have found it one of the most engaging and curious topics throughout the module. Prior to having studied the topic, it was my understanding that the traditional interpretation of the right to silence remained intact, however in reality it seems that this is far from the truth. In my opinion this seems to be an exorbitant erosion of one of the fundamental principles and protections of English law and thus this is my motivation for choosing it as the topic for my essay. The exact title of the essay arises from the fact that my opinion on the merits of the right to silence are very straightforward, that I believe in its importance and merits within the legal system. As such the essay title and thus essay, focuses both on whether the right to silence should exist and significantly whether it still does within the modern legal system. The starting point of my research was as always my lecture notes and textbook. Traditionally this is often the point from which I begin an essay as it gives me the basic areas with which to cover and points me in the direction of further areas of study. My second point of research is along the same lines, that I like to consult another textbook, simply to consolidate my earlier research and again to point me in the direction of further ideas. For this purpose I looked at Roberts and Zuckerman's Criminal Evidence as it's a book I've consulted previously during ALS and other modules and is very good analytical text. <fnote>Choo, Andrew L-T: Evidence, Oxford University Press, First Edition, 2006. P67-95 </fnote><fnote>Roberts and Zuckerman, Criminal Evidence, Oxford University Press, First Edition, 2004 </fnote>From here my research switches primarily to journal articles. I found these online through Westlaw and Lexis Nexis and used these to provide more specific research on the right to silence debate and the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. I also used Westlaw and Lexis Nexis to find the relevant cases and legislation. Finally I conducted two interviews; firstly with a local defence solicitor  who works for  and secondly with a prosecutor from the Warwickshire CPS . I chose to leave the interviews until last as I wanted to be certain of my subject material and specific questions I could ask, rather than simply asking general questions which would be of little benefit. I conducted the interviews by telephone and created a list of questions I wanted answering prior to calling. I asked questions as to the use and implementation of the right to silence and I specifically asked whether they were in favour of the right to silence and whether they believed it still existed.
