<heading>Introduction</heading>The Copas partnership is made up of Tom Copas and his two daughters. The partnership emerged through the splitting of the farm in Cookham between Tom Copas and his brother. Today the partnership owns and runs a diverse range of rural businesses, made up of four sectors - Traditional Christmas turkeys, property and letting of farm buildings, Henley Regatta and traditional arable. Each business contributes to the Copas partnership turnover, with the regatta contributing 20%, turkeys 50%, property 21% and arable 9%. The business has changed through recent years diversifying from solely arable production to now including the other three enterprises. Arable production has been scaled down due to the decrease in prices and increasing costs. Diversification has been very important to the Copas partnership, adjusting the enterprise mix has allowed the business to become more profitable and also meet consumer demand. Increasingly farmers are looking to diversify. In 2000 over 60% of farms received incomes from outside farming (CPRE 2000). The reasons why farmers look to diversify are the financial need, the opportunity or due to the inclination from personal interests or a particular skill. Diversification can take place in three forms - <list>On farm agricultural diversification such as growth of alternative crops or deer farming.On farm non-agricultural diversification such as farm shops or bed and breakfast.Off farm diversification such as part time work.</list>(Source: CPRE 2000) The Copas partnership has diversified in both on farm agricultural through the turkey production, and on farm non-agricultural diversification with the Henley Regatta and farm buildings conversion. <heading>What would have taken place when the Copas Partnership were considering to diversify</heading>When considering diversification it is very important to plan the business venture in great detail in order to it to have a higher chance of being successful. <heading>SWOT - </heading>A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis would help to access the current condition of the business, highlighting opportunities in which the business could go. It would highlight the financial position of the current business. In the case of the Copas partnership the arable production was not financially successful and therefore was a weakness to the business. Instead the financial resources involved in this enterprise could be used for an opportunity for farm diversification. <heading>Market Research - </heading>Careful definition of the market with assessment of its nature and size are important. In considering these, the business needs to think about their ability to serve it, and the potential of others to do likewise. Tom Copas would have undertaken market research for each diversification, looking at the location, number of people likely to use the diversification, competitors and prices charged. Market research can highlight niche market opportunities, which Tom Copas seems to have for all three types of diversification he has achieved. <heading>Availability of funding - </heading>Funding could come internally, such as directly from the farm business, or externally such as a bank loan. With this method of funding interest would have to be paid and a detailed business plan needed in order to get consent from the bank manager. For the farm building conversion Tom Copas borrowed money from the bank and therefore had to get the plan certified by the bank manager. Without this diversification could not have taken place. Tom also got funding for the turkey processing through a grant from defra in 2003. This allowed the erection of the current high quality-processing unit. <heading>Planning - </heading>Planning consent would have been very important to know whether diversification could go ahead or not, and whether every aspect of design could be achieved. This would have been an aspect for each enterprise, but key to the farm building conversion. 17% of farmers looking to diversify cannot due to planning restrictions (CPRE 2000). Tom Copas received planning for all three diversification projects. <heading>Feasibility study - </heading>This would bring together all aspects of planning for diversification and show whether the venture will work. It would comprise all market research, funding and predicted cash flows. Each enterprise for the Copas partnership would have shown to be feasible and therefore diversification went ahead. <heading>Why Diversification has been successful</heading><heading>Building Conversion</heading>It was decided to convert the farm buildings into offices for letting to businesses. Location was one of the most important factors into whether the venture would be successful. The conversion is situated on a hilltop with outstanding views including Windsor Castle. This has added to the value of the conversion as well as customer appeal. The location in terms of accessibility is also important. The farm is on the outskirts of Reading, therefore within commuting distance of London. The suitability of buildings for conversion was important. Conversion has been using capital assets, reusing redundant farm buildings and the buildings were attractive and well situated therefore suitable for conversion. High quality conversion has attracted a certain high quality target market. This has made it easy for Tom Copas to find tenants. The high quality conversion has meant that a higher price of £30/ft instead of the normal price of £18/ft in Reading. The total cost of conversion for the farm was £1.6million. However the high quality, and location has made this diversification successful. <heading>Henley Regatta</heading>Part of Remenhan farm, one of the farms owned by the partnership lies along the river Thames. The farm has 2 miles of riverbank and 500 acres of available land. This has meant that there has been an opportunity to diversify into providing facilities for the Henley Regatta, which takes place every year, as the land owned runs adjacent to the course. From firstly providing just parking for the Henley Regatta, the business has grown and now provides everything from catering, picnic areas, trade stands and parking, along with sharing with another business the hospitality. Diversification into this area for the business has been successful because of its prime location and the availability of land. This, along with taking the opportunity to run the regatta show, and providing facilities with higher value than just parking, has meant that the enterprise is profitable. <heading>Turkeys</heading>Marketing has played a key role in the success of the diversification into turkey production for the Copas partnership. Marketing the product is important, implementation including selling methods, packaging, promotion and advertising (MAFF 1994). The use of the brand has allowed customers to recognise their product and therefore associate it will quality. The brand as shown below is included in all packaging and promotion. <picture/>Contracting out the rearing to meet demand has allowed this enterprise to continue to be successful and provide 50% of the farm income. The turkey enterprise has grown to producing forty thousand birds each year for Christmas (killing and dispatching within 14 days); some rearing of the birds is contacted out to 8 other farmers in order to meet demand. The use of labour could have been a problem for the business; two hundred and fifty employees are required at Christmas. The farm has over come this potential problem through linking with fruit farms and using their labour during the quite time for fruit picking over Christmas. It was seen by Tom Copas that there was a future for his turkey production as it could not be limited by CAP or planning, which the other ventures could. <heading>Current and future opportunities for the rural business</heading>Diversification has shown to be important to the business, now providing 91% of the farm income. The success has been due to the planning and research of each enterprise before diversification has taken place. Continued growth has allowed the business to remain profitable, in order to remain successful current and future opportunities for the business are important. Current and future opportunities for the turkey enterprise will be analysed below. <heading>Continued marketing</heading>The turkeys are marketed to a very high standard, in presentation boxes, branded greaseproof packaging and with herbs and information. A current opportunity would be to continue producing marketing that promotes the product. A stuffing and cranberry sauce have been produced to add to marketing, other aspects could be to produce a serving dish with the Copas brand on to display the Copas turkey at the Christmas table. This would involve design and communication with a manufacturer that would be willing to produce for the company. But it could be successful and add to the customer experience. <heading>Production of turkeys for Waitrose</heading>Tom Copas aims to 'produce the finest quality turkeys available in the UK' (Farmers Weekly 2005). Because of this aim currently the partnership sells their birds through 250 individual butchers and at their own farm gate in order to achieve the high quality standard and customer experience. They do not sell to any supermarkets. This is because lower cost supermarkets such as Asda do not generally market turkeys produced in the way the Copas do, with dry hand plucking and hanging of the meat. A future opportunity would be to sell to high market supermarkets. This would allow the business to expand and achieve a higher market share. In order to maintain the current quality level and customer experience the partnership could sell to only Waitrose or Marks and Spencer. These two supermarkets have the high quality perception that meets the partnership standards. The implications of this however would be that the business would have to produce many more turkeys each year. However to meet this the business could contract out more turkeys to farmers to grow. The quality would still be maintained through Tom Copas stating standards for the turkeys to be grown, inspections of premises, returning to the farm for killing and processing and the company providing the birds and food, which are the same for all turkeys produced. This method of selling may however upset butchers with customers moving from purchasing their turkeys from them to the supermarkets instead. . <heading>Goose production</heading>Many customers that are buying turkeys also ask for details of geese. Currently the business provides a goose that has come from a neighbouring farm for these customers. This means that there is an opportunity to produce and sell geese. This opportunity is backed up by the fact that the farm already has up to date processing and slaughtering facilities, and these could be used for geese as well as turkeys. The whole niche could be maintained, producing slow maturing, dry hand plucked geese for the Christmas market exactly the same as they are currently doing with the turkeys. It is likely that this current opportunity would not grow to be any where near as large as the turkey production, as a goose at Christmas is not as popular among some customers as turkeys. Customers and butchers currently asking for geese shows however that there is a market, and instead of providing another farmers produce the Copas Partnership could take this opportunity and use it themselves. <heading>Letting of buildings during months when not in use</heading>The buildings at the farm house the turkeys for just six months of the year, rearing them from chicks to larger birds ready for Christmas. The remaining part of the year the buildings are empty. This means that a capital asset to the farm is depreciating and not being used to its full potential, this means that it is not economically viable. The average fully covered and enclosed barn costs £150 per metre squared (Nixs 2005). In order to over come this the business could rent out the buildings for the months that they remain empty. These could be for lambing, or parking vehicles etc. Any income received from renting the buildings for any purpose for the months that they are currently empty is extra income, which the farm is not receiving at the moment. The only implications of this opportunity would be that the renters would have to accept that they could only use the buildings for a few months, but if the buildings were used such as for lambing this would not be a problem. <heading>Conclusion</heading>The key to why the Copas partnership has been successful is due to the previous planning, along with identifying emerging opportunities and particular niches in the locality. The business has been successful in bringing in added income through scaling up the profitable enterprises and scaling down the non profitable, such as the arable production. Current and future opportunities for the turkey enterprise include future marketing, goose production, renting of buildings and supermarket production. These would allow the business to continue to expand in this enterprise like they have in the past and bring in extra income to the partnership. Most of these opportunities, if the Copas choose to go ahead with them, would require no major alterations to the current business and resources that are available and would not be restrained by CAP or planning.
