S=1/2 spin multiplicity =2(1/2)+1 = 2 => doublet. <heading>Do you need to do more than Hartree-Fock for the H atom? Why/why not? </heading>No, H is a 1 electron system, as such does not require any electron correlation or exchange terms- thus post Hartree-Fock theories offer no advantage other than to take longer in terms of computation time to reach the same answer. <list><heading> FORMULA </heading> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list><heading>Show your working to calculate the bond energy. </heading> FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  <list><heading> FORMULA </heading> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list><heading>Show your working to calculate the bond energy. </heading> FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>What do you think are the main sources of error in your computed CCSD(T) result? </heading>The sources of error underlying computational calculations are 1) the level of theory used (high level meaning it has few or very good approximations, and low level meaning it has many or not very good approximations), 2) The basis set used for geometry optimisation and energy calculation, 3) The geometry optimisation (dependant upon the level of theory used and basis set). Here the two levels of theory used are post HF theories- which include CI terms that help correct electron correlation in HF theory. Post HF theory is quite high thus I expect it not to be a large source of error here. The geometry was optimised at the same level of theory and the same basis set as the energy calculation. Thus since the level of theory is high, it is likely that the errors here are dependant upon the basis set. The size of the basis set is essential in calculations, since it affects the geometry optimisation and the energy calculation of the geometry optimisation. Fundamentally if a insufficient basis set is chosen, then the calculation is flawed. Here a slightly larger than normal basis set is employed, however to make CI term better in calculation, more heavy atoms could be added and polarisable functions to the basis set. <heading>CH2 radical</heading><list><heading> FORMULA </heading> FORMULA  FORMULA </list><heading>Which electronic state is lower and by how much? </heading>The triplet state lies lower in energy than the singlet and by:  FORMULA  <list><heading> FORMULA </heading> FORMULA  FORMULA </list><heading>Which electronic state is lower and by how much? </heading>The triplet state lies lower in energy than the singlet and by:  FORMULA  <list><heading> FORMULA </heading> FORMULA </list><heading>Which electronic state is lower and by how much? </heading>The triplet state lies lower in energy than the singlet and by:  FORMULA  <heading>Comment on the likely sources of error in your calculations. </heading>Again as stated earlier, the error in the calculations of energy is dependant upon 1) the level of theory, 2) the basis set and 3) the geometry optimisation . There are two different types of theory at use here: DFT and post HF theory. The post HF calculations are very consistent within each other: within ~0.05% of each other and 0.5% consistent with DFT calculations. The geometry was optimised at the same level as the energy was calculated at. Thus the main source of error here is the level of theory used is insufficient to deal with the triplet states, or the size of the basis set is not large enough. <heading>Part II</heading><heading>Decomposition of methanal</heading><list><heading> FORMULA  calculations:</heading>What is ETS?

However DFT-PBEPBE is the best I have calculated for the forward barrier. The best theoretical estimates from literature are better than my forward barrier calculations, and are within 3% of experiment (and correctly predict the forward barrier is lower than the reverse barrier, with MP2 they are the wrong way around!) <heading>Hydrogen fluoride dimer</heading><heading>Do you think the Hartree-Fock geometry of the HF dimer is suitable for use in SPE calculations? Why/why not? How did the corresponding Hartree-Fock interaction energy compare with experiment? </heading><table/>The interaction energy HF calculations provided compared to experiment was poor (62% away from experiment), however the geometry it provided was relatively good. R within 0.1 Å. α and β within 3˚ of experimental values. Thus it is a valid to use the Hartree-Fock dimer geometry and calculate a SPE using MP2. <list><heading>MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ//HF/6-31G SPE calculations:</heading> FORMULA  FORMULA </list><heading>Show your working to obtain the interaction energy:</heading><list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list><heading>Is the interaction energy calculated at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ//HF-6-31G level of theory an improvement over your HF and DFT estimates? Make a brief comment on your result. </heading><table/>The interaction energy calculated at MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ//HF-6-31G level is within 6.0% of experiment, whereas the HF/6-31+G(d,p) calculation is within 6.5% of experiment and LSDA/6-31+G(d,p) is within 95.6% of experiment! Thus it is a slight improvement compared to the HF/6-31+G(d,p) level, but is a lot better than the LSDA/6-31+G(d,p) estimate of interaction energy. However in terms of bond angles it is the same if not slightly further away from experiment than HF/6-31+G(d,p) level, but gives a hugely better estimate of R: 0.6% within experiment, instead of 3.2% at the HF/6-31+G(d,p) level. Thus the improvement is not vast compared to the HF method previously employed, but it is noticeable. <list><heading>MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ//MP2/6-31G SPE calculations:</heading> FORMULA  FORMULA </list><heading>Show your working to obtain the interaction energy:</heading><list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list><heading>Give brief comments on whether re-optimising at the MP2/6-31G level has made a substantial improvement to your SPE calculations. </heading>Re-optimising at MP2/6-31G level has decreased the error with respect to experiment from 6.0% to 0%. This is a substantial improvement in calculation, however the previous result was probably within the experimental error, and thus sufficient. However it is very pleasing to get "the" answer! <heading>Give a brief comment on the balance between resource required (such as computing time) vs. quality of results, using these two SPE calculations as examples. </heading>It is always the aim of any calculation or experiment to gain the highest level of accuracy possible, however this has to be balanced by the resources required to achieve this. Here both results are perfectly acceptable (when compared to experiment and errors associated), one result however is better in quality than the other. However in larger systems, when computing time will be large anyway, there could be a significant argument for using SPE calculations instead of MP2//MP2 calculations due to the extra time it would require to calculate the results. <heading>Part 3</heading><heading>H2O...

C. Legon, D. J. Millen, Chem. Soc. Rev. , 1, 71 (1992) </fnote><heading>2) Ideas, Dipole Moments, Van Der Waals Interactions</heading>Water obviously has a dipole moment, due to the very electronegative Oxygen atom drawing electron density towards itself, and away from the two hydrogens inducing a permanent dipole moment: This was calculated to be 2.235 Debyes at HF/6-31+G(d,p) level. Hydrogen fluoride similarly has a permanent dipole moment, due to the very electronegative fluorine atom dragging electron density towards itself, creating a permanent dipole. This was calculated to be 2.042 Debyes at HF/6-31+G(d,p) level. Based on this dipole moments and the prior calculations performed on HF dimer, there are some obvious possible structures for the dimer: Dimer 2 corresponds to that proposed in literature (3) <heading>3) "Low-level" preliminary calculations of possible structures </heading>In previous long range weekly bonded interactions (methane, hydrogen fluoride dimer) calculations; DFT-LSDA performed poorly with the H-F dimers however HF/6-31G and HF/6-31+G(d,p) provided reasonable results. From this premise, I decided that it would be best to do "low" level calculations with Hartree-Fock instead of a DFT theory (however a DFT theory at high level may provide a good answer for the weak interaction). Since the comparative computation time on these similar systems between HF/6-31G and a larger basis of 6-31+G(d,p) has been small, I decided there was no reason not to use the larger basis set- which in previous weak interaction calculations has been very good. <heading>Monomer Geometry and Energies optimised at HF/6-31+G(d,p):</heading><table/><heading>Dimer 1</heading>Dimer 1's structure and energy was found by optimising to the same level of theory as monomers, the structure can be seen below: <figure/><table/><list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list>The energy is at a true localised minima or minimum since all the vibrational frequencies are a) real and b) positive. <heading>Dimer 2</heading>Dimer 2's structure and energy was found by optimising to the same level of theory as monomers, the structure can be seen below: <figure/>This is the same geometry as outlined in (3), which coincides with the notion that the Hydrogen on HF is bonding to a lone pair on the Oxygen, and thus leads to this pseudo-tetrahedral angle. <table/><list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list>The energy is at a true localised minima or minimum since all the vibrational frequencies are a) real and b) positive. <heading>Dimer 3</heading>Dimer 3's structure and energy was found by optimising to the same level of theory as monomers, the structure can be seen below: <figure/><table/><list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list>The energy is at a true localised minima or minimum since all the vibrational frequencies are a) real and b) positive. <heading>4) Best Structure</heading>Dimer 2 is the best structure in terms that it provides the largest interaction energy, however the interaction energy is lower than the experimental energy! Dimer 1 has a similarly low energy. Geometrically Dimer 2 better- marginally better O-F distance, and structure is inline with predicted non-planar structure (~60°). Thus making Dimer 1 a local minima, and Dimer 2 likely the global minima. Dimer 3 however as predicted earlier is not the global minima, and has a very small energy interaction. Dimer 2 was selected as the best structure, and re-optimised at a higher level of theory. MP2 was chosen for this task, since it appeared to outperform other theoretical calculations when looking at the hydrogen fluoride dimer. Also it should outperform HF calculations, due to the extra CI terms which correct correlation. The geometry of the system was optimised at the same level as the energy was to be calculated, as earlier in this lab this yielded the best results, and with negligible extra computation time (compared to SPE). <table/><heading>H2O--HF MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ dimer results:</heading><figure/><table/><list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list>The interaction energy here is even larger than at the HF/6-31+G(d,p) level! However the r(O-F) distance is substantially better and the angle too. Surprised by this I decided to revert back to Hartree-Fock theory, using a larger basis set since they were very reliable last time. Again since the system is small, and led to better results last time, I used the same level of theory and basis set for the monomer geometry optimisation as well as the dimer energy calculation. <table/><heading>H2O--HF HF/6-311++G(2df,2pd) dimer results:</heading><figure/><table/><list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list>This calculation is far closer to experimental values than before in terms of geometric and energetically. It appears to have modelled the interaction well and without the need for CI- implying that correlation is not important in this dimer situation? <heading>5) Comparison to Experimental Results and Conclusions</heading>Comparing the two high level calculations. They both over estimate the interaction energy, however the MP2 by 26% and the HF only by 4.5%. Also the angle - deviation from the planar structure is better in the HF calculation than the MP2 and better than previously calculated when compared with experimental data. However the O-F distance is better with MP2 than with HF calculations- 0.2% instead of 2% within experiment. I suspected the post-HF interaction energy calculations would be better than the high level HF calculations. Here I was wrong, when comparing to experimental data. On the whole however the increase in basis set size has helped to estimate better interaction energies and geometric parameters of the dimer. I would have been interested to have performed a high level DFT calculation (perhaps PBEPBE with a large basis set), to see how well that performed comparatively to the methods examined here.
