Epiphytes are plants that live on other plants for support. Their lifestyle is firstly a way of occupying space. Examples of epiphytes can be seen in bryophytes, ferns, lichens, mosses etc, bromeliads, cacti and flowering plants; of these the orchids are most prevalent. They can be distinguished from parasites, as they do not obtain water or food from the host plant's living tissues. They may live directly on the host plant, known as the phorophyte, or in its outer dead tissues. Epiphyte and phorophyte may be of same or differing species, but neither directly harms the other. <picture/>Epiphytes are found in every major group of the plant kingdom and are commonly described as 'air' plants as they lack obvious means of securing nutrients and moisture from solid media. Some extreme cases can be seen in the 'atmospheric' bromeliads (genus: Tillandsia, viz. T. recurvata etc.), which can even survive on non-organic substrates such as telephone wires thus illustrating their dependency on the atmosphere alone. Examples of epiphytism can also be seen in water systems: algae that grow on aquatic herbs are referred to as 'aquatic' epiphytes. Vines and Lianas should not be confused with the group, as they are not considered to be epiphytic unless they have been 'without soil contact' for some period of their life cycle. <heading>Hemi - epiphytes</heading>Plants can be epiphytic for only parts of their life cycle. These are known as hemi-epiphytes, of which there are two types. The primary epiphyte is germinated and originally grows attached to a tree. It then grows aerial roots down from the canopy, to become rooted into the soil. This provides the plant with more nutrients causing faster growth and it remains in contact with the soil for the rest of its life though still leaning on the plant it started on. The secondary epiphyte begins rooted in the soil and grows into the dark. This leads it to a suitable plant, usually a tree. It then grows towards the light (up the tree) until it reaches a appropriate area to settle such as a rotten stump of a broken branch, a deep ridge in the bark or a fork in branches. The soil-touching roots may then be abandoned and the plant lives as an epiphyte. An interesting example of hemi-epiphytism is the fig (primary hemi-) epiphytes. A fig tree goes through its juvenile stage attached to an old canopy tree and begins to grow aerial roots that hang down through the air, and thin roots that run down the trunk of the host. Growth of the fig is increased when the roots enter the ground as additional water and nutrients are obtained. A network of roots soon grows around that of the phorophyte and become thick and a competition for nutrients ensues. Eventually they will go on to effectively 'strangle' the host tree as flow of water and nutrients are cut of and the leaves of the host tree are shaded, and kill it. Although this seemingly verges on parasitism, murder may be the more appropriate term. <picture/><heading>Adaptations </heading>Epiphytes can be found in many regions of the world, though the lifestyle seems to be favoured in equatorial regions due to the poor conditions of the forest floor, meaning that plants must find an alternative way to survive. They obtain a lot of their water from the air, which means they require a high humidity. High light intensity and fairly warm temperatures favour the effective (apparent) photosynthesis of these plants, which determines growth rate. Epiphytic plants are therefore abundant in tropical rainforests, and their way of life gives them advantages over other plants. The main reason for the adaptation is to gain more light, as the rainforest floor has very low light intensity due to high tree density. The height also means they have a greater number of canopy animal pollinators. It provides protection from lower level herbivores and physical damage of animals on the forest floor. In order to cope with arid conditions of the desert, and the rainforest (where a large percentage of epiphyte species are found) epiphytes, like all organisms, have evolved to suit their surroundings. There are many variations of how this has been done, such as: the shape and position of leaves; mechanism of photosynthesis and tissue type. Leaves can be broad and create 'tank' structures, which store rainwater and falling debris. Nest ferns have the ability to collect humus around the roots allowing the plant to become self-sufficient in water and nutrients. This 'nest', usually made from broad fronds arising from a short stem, can accumulate decaying matter from dead leaves of the phorophyte or nearby plants. The dead matter is held firmly in place by the arrangement of new leaves and the whole system acts as a sponge giving the ability to store water. Thick cuticles; reduced transpiration surfaces; and dead hairs covering the stomata, also aid in keeping water loss to a minimum. There are evolutionary changes concerned with the compromise between photosynthesis and the prevention of water loss, which are both essential to the plant. The plant gains the carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis through the opening of stomata (pores on leaf surface) but this is also how most of the water loss occurs. When weather is hot and dry, a plant will need to close its stomata in order to retain all its water and prevent transpiration. This causes a problem as the plant cannot take in any carbon dioxide and therefore it cannot photosynthesise. Photorespiration occurs even with stomata only partially closed, as carbon dioxide concentrations within spaces in the leaf decrease, and oxygen concentrations increase (the oxygen is a produce from the light reactions). During photorespiration, Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is used up and no sugar is produced. This process, therefore, is not seen to have any benefit to the plant, and is considered wasteful as around 50% of the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle is drained away. Some plants have evolved alternative methods of carbon fixation, which work to reduce the amount of photorespiration, by incorporating the CO 2 into organic intermediates before entering the carbon cycle. These adaptations are C 4 photosynthesis and Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM); so named as the process was first found in the succulents of the plant family Crassulaceae. In C 4 plants, there is an alternative pathway preceding the Calvin cycle that produces a four-carbon compound as its first product (normal photosynthesis produces a three-carbon compound), due to a unique leaf anatomy. It involves the use of PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate) carboxylase to fix carbon as, unlike Rubisco, it has a high affinity for carbon dioxide and no affinity for oxygen. Overall the process ensures a 'carbon dioxide concentrating pump' fuelled by ATP. The CAM mechanism of photosynthesis is developed in plants allowing them to only open stomata at night, keeping them closed when temperatures are too hot in the day. Normally photosynthesis would not be able to work in this way, despite the influx of carbon dioxide the plant has received, as the needed light is not supplied. This is overcome by fixing the carbon from CO 2 into a variety of organic acids that are stored till morning. This can then be released and utilised to make sugars when it becomes light and the ATP and NADPH needed for the Calvin cycle can be provided by the light reactions (and at this time stomata are closed and the plant retains its water). Around two thirds of species of the Ordchidaceae family are epiphytic and of these approximately 60% are thought to photosynthesise using the CAM mechanism. <heading>Relationships with other organisms in the canopy</heading>Some epiphytes create small ecological niches within the canopy that contain or are used by a range of species, which also benefits the epiphyte. A good example of this can be seen within the tank bromeliad of South America. It has stiff, upturned leaves and these create a structure capable of holding a relatively large volume (around 10l) of rainwater. This provides a drinking supply for some canopy animals, and space for shelter and breeding of smaller species. They are often used by some species of frog as a 'nursery' for young- where tadpoles/ eggs can develop undisturbed by the predators that threaten them at ground level. Trees can also use the epiphyte to their advantage, growing aerial roots into their water retaining structures, so they too can take up the water and nutrients the epiphyte has collected. Their presence can also benefit other epiphytic species, as in the case of many orchids living in high altitude 'cloud-forests' which would not be able to survive without a moist bryophyte layer beneath them. Another common inhabitant of the bromeliad is Stinging ants. They can be seen to colonise the plants, particularly those with interconnecting chambers. This is of obvious benefit to the ant population, but the presence of the ants is also advantageous to the plant. It can use the ant waste and debris material brought by the ant, as a source of nutrients. Although some of the epiphytes with 'tanks' for collection may use the matter of small decomposing animals as a food source, they are not considered carnivorous as they do not actively predate these animals but catch them by chance. There are, however, some arguments for some specialised cases to be seen as carnivorous. This further adaptation may be thought to be logical for epiphytes considering their nutritionally scarce environment, as it would be high-energy sustenance. This does not seem to be the case in practise. It is likely that the necessary changes require too much energy and material to become worthwhile, while there is the ongoing search/competition for light and water supplies, which govern all rates of growth. <heading>Effects of epiphytes </heading>Epiphytes are not parasitic, i.e. do not obtain nourishment at the phorophyte's expense and are not metabolically dependant on the phorophyte. However, they often damage the phorophyte indirectly. A tree thickly colonised by epiphytes will be affected as light is compromised. The epiphytes on the higher branches absorb the sunlight, and shield the lower branches of the phorophyte from receiving much of this. Due to heavy rainfall and leaching, the soil in the rainforest does not contain many nutrients so all possible organic decay is essential for plants rooted in soil to gain nutrients. As many epiphytes have adapted structures to catch falling leaf matter (to utilise decomposed organic matter as an energy source), they reduce the amount that lands on the forest floor. (Thus reducing the host tree's nutrients). Another way in which epiphytes are a hindrance to their host plant occurs when they grow very large and become substantially heavy. This results in a diversion of the tree's nutrients towards reinforcing branches. The weight can also break the branches. The effects of epiphytes on their host must be fairly significant as regular weeding takes place in many parks and gardens in hot countries. In addition to this, some trees have structures/properties, which seem to act as defence mechanisms against epiphytes. Smooth bark makes it difficult for epiphytes to climb or attach to a tree, as they require a toehold. Some trees, for example Terminalia Bursera, shed sheets of bark regularly to rid themselves of other plants. Some possess chemicals that prevent germination of plants on their surface. Movement of animals along branches also prevents epiphytic growth, indirectly. Epiphytes are a substantial and fascinating group within the vascular plants and provide a great deal of biological diversity. They give good example of adaptation to habitat and the idea of 'survival of the fittest'. The presence of plants growing on telephone wires shows the ability of some plants to survive just about anywhere! The xerophytic adaptation of epiphytes makes them useful for ornamental plants but none are economically useful- there are no major crops produced. They nevertheless make up an important part of their environment and have interesting relationships within the canopy, which need to be investigated further as new discoveries are being constantly made.
