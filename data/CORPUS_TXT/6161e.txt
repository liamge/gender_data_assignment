<heading>Introduction</heading>The main objective of this experiment will be to show the performance characteristics of a 'Rutland Wind Charger' turbine (fig.1). The turbine will be assessed under set laboratory conditions in order to produce qualitative comparisons that will determine the forms of both its Coefficient of Performance vs. Tip Speed Ratio (C p-λ), and Torque Coefficient vs. Tip Speed Ratio (C Q-λ) curves plotted on a graph. We will also examine the generator characteristics represented as a graph plot of the relationship between I (current delivered to the load), and ω (the rate of rotation in rpm) for constant voltages E. <picture/><heading>2. Methodology </heading><heading>2.1 Theory</heading>The efficiency of a wind turbine in extracting energy from the wind can be represented by a coefficient of performance, C p. The coefficient of performance is given by the formula:  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  We cannot measure the power extracted from the wind directly but the electrical power output should be proportional to the power extracted from the wind. P w is proportional to EI (Where E is The Voltage and I is the Current supplied to the load) therefore  FORMULA  the wind velocity V is proportional to the square root of pressure difference value ΔP. So V is proportional to √∆p. therefore  FORMULA   FORMULA  Therefore if we substitute V with √∆p we get  FORMULA  <heading>2.2 Method</heading><heading>Turbine Position</heading>The turbine was fixed upon a support frame, within a safety cage so that it interacted nicely with the exhaust flow of the laboratory 'Plint' variable speed wind tunnel. The turbine rotor diameter was 503mm, this was significantly larger than the tunnel working section (305x305mm), so would therefore not fit inside. The turbine position outside the tunnel had the advantage of making it easier to take measurements within this controlled environment (fig.2). <picture/><heading>Wind speed / Velocity (measured in m/s). </heading>By adjusting the main wind tunnel speed control dial, we were able to control the velocity of exhaust air exiting the tunnel. This allowed us to take a set of measurements at 5 different wind velocities. The wind velocity was measured in metres per second (m/s) using a digital electrical probe. This was placed in the exhaust flow at several positions across the 'face' of the turbine blades. Measurements were taken in the centre of the exhaust flow at the same distance from the blades for all wind speed tests. <heading>Rate of Rotation (measured in rpm). </heading>A digital optical tachometer in conjunction with a reflective plate placed onto the rear surface of a blade was used to measure the rate of turbine blade rotation in revolutions per minute (rpm). Measurements were taken at a stationary position at a set distance from the reflector plate until a steady rpm was measured. <heading>Pressure Readings (ΔP). </heading>A pitot-static tube was set within the working section of the tunnel facing into the flow and connected to an electronic digital manometer. This device automatically read the difference between the static P and stagnation (total) pressure P0 to give us the pressure difference value ΔP. <heading>Voltage and Current Readings </heading>To measure the Voltage (E) and Current (I) equipment included both an analogue and digital Amp meter wired in series with the turbine, with a series of variable resister banks rated at 35.6 ohms in the circuit allowing us to vary the electrical 'load'. An analogue and digital analogue and digital Voltmeter were wired in parallel across the leads from the turbine to measure the potential difference in Volts across the circuit (fig.3). Analogue and digital meters were used as digital meters are quick to respond to sudden changes in electrical flow and can therefore readings fluctuate rapidly. Analogue meters are slower to respond and 'iron' out rapid fluctuations, they can be easier to read once they settle. <picture/><heading>Order of which measurements were taken:</heading><list>Set wind speed.

The optimal position of the curve for this turbine cannot be accurately plotted. Some voltages at different wind speeds lie outside of an ideal Cp / λ curve, this could indicate that these combinations of Voltage and wind speed are not as efficient in producing electrical power as those values that lie closer to the Cp / λ curve. The peak Coefficient of Performance value of 0.0028 (fig.5) was obtained when the turbine was rotating at 870 RPM in 11.63m/s of wind generating 0.92 amps at 12.5V producing 11.5 Watts. (Figure 7) shows that voltages as low as 2.5V could be generated over a range of speeds of rotation from as low as 250rpm upwards, though at 250rpm the generator could only generate 0.4 Amps. To generate more current at these low voltages we needed to increase the speed of rotation, for example 2.5 Amps at 750rpm. This was achieved by increasing the wind speed. Higher voltages were generated at higher speeds of rotation too. For example 20V was only generated above 1000rpm and at this rotation speed the current was only 0.2 Amps. To generate more current at 20V we needed to increase the speed of rotation above 1000rpm, again by increasing the wind speed. As we increase the wind speed velocity the current supplied to the load increased, the rate of rotation increased but the voltage decreased. The relationship between Current (I) and the speed of rotation (rpm) when drawing different loads at the same voltages clearly appears to simultaneously increase in linear fashion. <heading>Torque Performance</heading>(Figure 6) shows clearly that at each fixed wind speed (DP) the speed of turbine rotation increases as the Voltage supplied to the load increases, it is the current supplied to the load that varies. For example when the difference in pressure (∆p) value was either 133,188 or 253, and the voltage supplied to the load was between 2.5 & 5V the current supplied to the load increased slightly before decreasing at Voltages above 5V. When the (∆p) value was either 90 or 363, and the voltage supplied to the load was between 2.5 & 5V the current supplied to the load remained the same, before decreasing at Voltages above 5V. At (∆p) values above 441, the current supplied to the load decreased at each Voltage increase. Although there are these minor variations, the general trend is that at each wind speed (∆p), as the Voltage supplied to the load increases, so the rate of rotation increases, but the current supplied to the load decreases. Figure 4 shows that at a wind velocity of 10m/s (or equivalent ∆p of 13.71) at 15V we generated 0.43Amps so the resistance was 34 ohms. Increasing the voltage to 17.5V and we generated 0.3Amps but the resistance increased to 58 ohms. This is because we are demanding more energy from the generator by increasing the resistance at the load. Increasing resistance means less current can be delivered to the load. The only way to generate an increased current at higher voltages is to increase the wind speed hence increasing the available Kinetic energy. This proves that there is only so much energy we can extract from the wind at any particular velocity before both the torque and performance coefficient decreases. <heading>Maximum Power Output Comparison</heading>The maximum power output in Amps was plotted against the wind speed (fig.8) where wind speed was converted into knots for comparison against the manufacturer's performance specification graph (fig.9). The trend line generated from our data plots suggests that our best power output in Amps for every wind speed was in fact lower than that suggested by the manufacturer. For example we were generating 1 Amp at 20 knots, where the manufacturer claims the turbine would do this at 15 knots. Likewise at almost 30 knots we generated 2.5 Amps whereas the manufacturer suggests we should generate 3.7 Amps. <heading>A more realistic Cp / λ curve ? </heading>In our mathematical equations we worked out the coefficient of performance (Cp) and the Tip speed Ratio (λ), using the square root difference in pressure (√∆p) as the wind velocity as the velocity 'V' is proportional to √∆p. We assumed using the Continuity Equation (A 1V 1 = A 2V 2) that the wind velocity at the turbine (V 2) was equal to the Velocity inside the working section of the tunnel (V 1) where our pitot-static measurements (∆p) were taken. The area inside the working section (A 1) was 305 x 305mm = 93,025 mm 2. The cross sectional area at the turbine (V 2) could not be measured as the turbine was in a position outside of the tunnel in free air. Therefore because A 2 could not be measured the continuity equation would not work. If equations were recalculated substituting √∆p with the true measured wind velocity at the face in front of the turbine, then our plots may have compared better to the manufacturers specification as shown in (fig.9). Interestingly if we substitute √∆p with the true velocity when plotting our Cp / λ Curves (fig.5), the Coefficient of Performance gets much better with a peak Cp value going from 0.0028 at 870 RPM, 0.92 amps at 12.5V generating 11.5 Watts (fig.5), to 0.0074 (fig.10). This proves that by increasing the wind speed we get a higher Cp value, a higher proportion of energy extracted at the blades. The individual Voltage Cp / λ curve plots (fig.10) also display a more chaotic nature than those smoother forms seen on our original (fig.5). This in essence could be caused by the true disturbed variable wind velocities the turbine was experiencing (fig.11), due to turbulent flow mixing in the tunnel exhaust. <figure/><heading>Discrepancies. </heading>Discrepancies that could affect results include: <heading>Airflow Turbulence</heading>The exhaust airflow from the tunnel exited through a circular nozzle opening 490mm in diameter. This was narrower than the Rotor diameter of 503mm. The jet of air leaving the nozzle would entrain with the air outside causing it to slow and mix via turbulent wind eddies. Although the jet is likely to have expanded to a larger diameter over the distance between the nozzle and the turbine to effectively influence the whole swept area, turbulent eddies within the flow could explain varying wind velocities measured across the face of the blades (fig.11). <figure/><heading>Yawing Issues</heading>The turbine was allowed to 'self yaw' itself into the airflow via means of its vertical tail fin. The motion of the fin was allowed to move to an extent via a hole cut into the rear section of the cage. On observation the tail wedged itself against one side of this hole and therefore kept the blades at a position slightly angled away from the airflow. <heading>Generator efficiency</heading>Due to lack of details from the turbine manufacturers we could not take into account the efficiency of the generator within our calculations. <heading>Circuitry</heading>The numerous wiring connections throughout the electrical circuits could have influenced the true power output from the generator by adding more resistance. <heading>Meter discrepancies. </heading>Large fluctuations were seen in the digital circuit meters, a more steady reading was observed on the analogue meters, although the readings on these appeared slightly lower than the digital. Most readings were taken from an average fluctuation from the digital meters.
