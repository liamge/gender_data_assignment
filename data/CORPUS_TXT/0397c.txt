Recent reforms have sparked much debate concerning the role of the disclosure rules in the English adversarial legal system. The scope of discussions has been generally concerned with the overall fairness of the criminal justice system, and is influenced by reference to both Article 6 of the ECHR, and broader notions of natural justice. "Many believe that disclosure represents one, if not the, most potent source of wrongful convictions", and as such it is essential that legislation offers protection to the accused while ensuring that justice is done. <fnote>European Convention on Human Rights, as incorporated into English law by the HRA 1998 </fnote><fnote>p 102 Ormerod D Improving The Disclosure Regime (2003) 7 E & P pp 102 - 129 </fnote>The CPIA was introduced against a backdrop of miscarriages of justice that were attributable to failures by the prosecution to disclose evidence. As well as purporting to address the issues raised by cases such as Ward, by requiring the prosecution to disclose unused material which might undermine the prosecution case, the act also placed an obligation on the accused to outline his defence. As a reward for doing so, the defence were to be supplied with secondary disclosure material that may assist their defence. While this initially appeared to appease the growing consensus in favour of some form of mandatory defence disclosure, it became evident that the disclosure scheme was not functioning as intended. The CJA was used as a vehicle to "remove perceived obstructions to the attainment of cheap and swift convictions", and in doing so placed greater obligations on the defence, while streamlining the prosecution's role with regard to unused material to one of continuous review. <fnote>Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 </fnote><fnote>See for example Judith Ward and Stephan Kiszko </fnote><fnote>R v Ward [1993] 1 W.L.R. 619 </fnote><fnote>s 7 CPIA </fnote><fnote>p 704 Leng R Losing sight of the defendant: the Government's proposals on pre-trial disclosure (1995) Crim LR Sept pp 704 - 711 </fnote><fnote>Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 2003 </fnote><fnote>p 103 Ormerod D Improving The Disclosure Regime (2003) 7 E & P pp 102 - 129 </fnote><fnote>See CPIA s 6A-D </fnote><fnote>See CPIA s 7A </fnote>As Quirk suggests, "both the CPIA and CJA are underpinned by the 'crime control' values and rhetoric about 'rebalancing' the system that have characterised recent criminal justice policy making". My concern is thus that in re-evaluating the principles of criminal justice, the government has lost sight of the need for a fair trial in order to maintain public faith in the legal system. With the assistance of empirical evidence, this essay will firstly consider whether the current regime makes adequate demands on the prosecution to furnish the defence with information. It will then proceed to assess the reciprocal obligations placed on the defence, and the extent to which these compromise the privilege against self incrimination and the duty of the state to prove a prima facie case. <fnote>p 45 Quirk H The significance of culture in criminal procedure reform: why the revised disclosure scheme cannot work (2006) 10(1) E & P pp 42 - 59 </fnote><heading>Prosecution Disclosure</heading><heading>The suspect's right to know the accusations against him</heading>During the trial process, the first point in issue is that the accused has the right "to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him". This information is automatically disclosed as part of proceedings for indictable or triable either way offences, but for summary only offences there is no statutory or common-law requirement for the prosecution to disclose the nature of the case. It appears to have been a dangerously unjust to fail to extend the right to prosecution disclosure to summary cases; as the jurisdiction of the magistrates' court has been gradually extended, so there is more at stake for the defendant. Failure to provide sufficient information to the defendant has the inherent potential to prejudice his ability to prepare his defence. In contrast to the wealth of information available to the prosecution, knowledge of little more than the charge against him is an institutional bias against the defendant resulting from the adversarial nature of the legal system. <fnote>Article 6(3)(a) ECHR </fnote><fnote>p 417 Emson R Evidence 3rd Edition, Palgrave Macmillan Law Masters, Hampshire 2006 </fnote><fnote>p 50 Spencer J Procedural Anomalies (2000) 59(1) Cambridge Law Journal pp 50 - 52 </fnote><fnote>See further Article 6(3)(b) ECHR </fnote>As a minimal protection, the prosecution are encouraged by the Attorney General's guidelines to disclose of "all evidence upon which the Crown proposes to rely in a summary trail". The guidelines are not binding, and in some respects it is possible to argue that they lack coercive force in the administration of justice. It has been observed that the level of cooperation between the CPS and the defence solicitors is minimal, and in one situation the CPS had no qualms about failing to disclose evidence where it had not been made available by the police before trial. <fnote>Para 57 AG's guidelines </fnote><fnote>Attorney General's Office, Attorney General's Guidelines  URL  </fnote><fnote>Magistrate. Comment based on observations over 9 year period </fnote>However, the guidelines are supported by case law that actively encourages disclosure. Prior to the CPIA, it was held in Kingston-upon-Hull Justices ex parte McCann that although disclosure is necessary in certain cases to fulfil the requirement of fairness, "there is no general obligation on a prosecutor to disclose such [witness] statements in advance of a summary trial". In the case of R v Stratford Justices, ex parte Colin Imbert, the court held that failure to disclose is not considered to impact on the fairness of the trial as a whole, and thus no harm is seen to be caused to the defendant. This conclusion was reached on the application of McCann, the court stating that <fnote>[1991] 155 JP 569 </fnote><fnote>Ibid per McCullough J </fnote><fnote>[1999] 2 Cr.

Following Imbert it initially appears that an adjournment may mitigate the consequences of non-disclosure, allowing time for the defence to respond to evidence brought to light during the trial. One Magistrate commented that this is frequently the case, and where proceedings are adjourned it is mainly because the CPS has not passed information to the defence. However, adjournments are considered an "unsatisfactory solution", disrupting the preferred method of continuous trial. They can lead to delays of four to six weeks, something which brings into question the defendants right to a hearing within a reasonable time and notably defies the government's aim of swift convictions. <fnote>p 442 Redmayne M Criminal Justice Act 2003: (1) Disclosure and its Discontents (2004) Crim LR 441 </fnote><fnote>Magistrate </fnote><fnote>Article 6(1) ECHR </fnote><fnote>Note 9 supra </fnote>Practice also suggests that there are issues surrounding the defendant not having enough evidence upon which to enter a plea. This was the issue in one case at Norwich Magistrates' Court, where the CCTV footage of the accused allegedly stealing items from a clothing store was not disclosed. As a result the case was adjourned for two weeks, with an order that the tape be disclosed to the defendant and the court within the following seven days. This case reflects the application of the decision in R v Calderdale Magistrates' Court where it was held that "[t]here was potential prejudice to them in the failure to disclose the video in time, accompanied by the refusal ... to adjourn the case". There has been much commentary on this area, and it is generally accepted that a plea can only be based on an informed choice, where the defence lawyer has received sufficient information to be able to properly advise the client. <fnote>[2000] WL 1480140 </fnote><fnote>Ibid para 34 per Pill LJ </fnote><fnote>p 142 Case Comment Procedure: Prosecution Failure to Disclose Video (2001) Crim LR Feb pp 141 - 143 </fnote><heading>The right to sufficient time and facilities to prepare a defence</heading>In addition to material concerning the prosecution case, the CPIA also regulates unused material, an issue which was "hotly debated" in the 1990s in the light of the aforementioned miscarriages of justice. Any impression is that it is difficult to reconcile with the adversarial nature of the criminal justice system is thus outweighed by the moral repulsion at convictions based on the suppression of evidence. The spine of the argument that the CPIA protects the defendant's right to a fair trial is the fact that prosecution disclosure redresses the inequality of resources between the two parties, ensuring that the inability to fund and administer independent investigations does not prevent the defence from adducing evidence. This is supported by the case law of the European Court of Human Rights which enounces that <fnote>p 55 Roberts P & Zuckerman A Criminal Evidence Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote><fnote>p 18 McEwan J Evidence and the Adversarial Process - The Modern Law 2nd Edition, Hart Publishing, Oxford, 1998 </fnote><fnote>Henceforth ECtHR </fnote><quote>"according to the principle of equality of arms, as one of the features of the wider concept of a fair trial, each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case in conditions that do not place him at a disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent."</quote><fnote>para 34, p 247 Foucher v France (1998) 25 E.H.R.R. 234, see further Bulut v.

The Netherlands (1994) 18 E.H.R.R. 213 </fnote>As such, the evidence gathered by the prosecution on which they do not intend to rely becomes "a kind of communal evidential resource" of which the Crown is considered trustee. In this respect prosecution disclosure can be seen to align with Bentham's theory of the maximum admissibility of evidence, such that there is the potential for all relevant material to be put before the court. <fnote>p 56 Roberts P & Zuckerman A Criminal Evidence Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote><fnote>p 476 O'Connor P Prosecution Disclosure: Principle, Practice and Justice (1992) Crim LR July pp 464 - 477 </fnote>The scope of defendants who are entitled to disclosure of unused material is set out in s 1, and it is important to note that it includes summary offences to which the defendant pleads not guilty, as well as indictable and either way offences. It has been argued that his creates a paradox where a defendant may be entitled to see unused material, but not that which relates to the case against him. Since the amendments by the CJA, the prosecutions obligation is now one of continual disclosure, replacing the two separate stages of primary and secondary disclosure, which "were often arbitrary and difficult to distinguish". Removing the condition of defence disclosure as a trigger for further information from the prosecution streamlines the process, and puts the emphasis on maximum disclosure, which is of benefit to a resourceless defendant. <fnote>p 51 Spencer J Procedural Anomalies (2000) 59(1) Cambridge Law Journal pp 50 - 52 </fnote><fnote>p 54 Quirk H The significance of culture in criminal procedure reform: why the revised disclosure scheme cannot work (2006) 10(1) E & P pp 42 - 59 </fnote>With the introduction of the CPIA it was noted that scope of discloseable material was at first reduced. The common law rules were founded on a duty to supply all relevant evidence, considering that it was in the defendant's interests to be able to consider all material on which the prosecution formed their case. Section 3 CPIA originally placed the prosecution under the requirement to disclose material "which in the prosecutor's opinion might undermine the case for the prosecution". The test was extended by the CJA to material "which might reasonably be considered capable of undermining the case for the prosecution against the accused or of assisting the case for the accused". This was in an attempt to address the pitfalls which had materialised since the introduction of the CPIA, it having been argued that "[t]o erect a relevance filter operated by the prosecution is to accept the risk of further miscarriages as the cost of achieving economy". As a result of removing the phrase 'in the prosecutor's opinion', the new test is objective, and ensures that the interests of the defendant are taken into consideration. The Attorney General's Guidelines also safeguard the defendant's interests by providing guidance on material which may undermine the prosecution's case, broadly suggesting categories of material and highlighting the cumulative effect of evidence. <fnote>p 645 R v Ward [1993] 1 W.L.R. 619 </fnote><fnote>p 704 Leng R Losing sight of the defendant: the Government's proposals on pre-trial disclosure (1995) Crim LR Sept pp 704 - 711, citing J.

The procedure itself is highly dependent on the discretion of the police disclosure officer, with the nature of the system meaning that prosecutors can disclose only information that he has brought to their attention or that which the prosecutor has inspected as a result of information contained in the schedules. Niblett argues that this emphasis on the integrity of the investigator and prosecutor is reasonable in terms of efficiency, particularly when balanced against the fact that deliberate concealment of relevant evidence is rare. However, if this is to be accepted as the case, it fails to appreciate the fallibility of disclosure officers, where one of the main difficulties is perceived to be that the schedules drawn up by the police are often incomplete or insufficiently detailed. While this may be due to innocent mistakes, the disparity in the consequences of insufficient disclosure for both parties does little to guarantee police compliance: failure to comply by the police does not make the officer liable to criminal or civil proceedings. It does, however, create the potential for a bias in the presentation of evidence which may mislead both parties and ultimately the court, to the extent that justice is not done. <fnote>p 300 Dennis I The Law of Evidence 2nd Edition, Sweet & Maxwell, London, 2002 </fnote><fnote>p 233 Niblett J Disclosure in Criminal Proceedings Blackstone Press Ltd, London, 1997 </fnote><fnote>p 444 Redmayne M Criminal Justice Act 2003: (1) Disclosure and its Discontents (2004) Crim LR 441 </fnote><fnote>p 188 Epp J Achieving the aims of the disclosure scheme in England and Wales (2001) 5(3) E & P pp 188 - 198 </fnote><heading>Defence Disclosure</heading><heading>Undermining the prosecution's duty to establish a prima facie case</heading>The corollary of prosecution's duty of disclosure is the growing obligation on the defence to disclose its case. Again summary offences operate under a different regime: defence disclosure is compulsory for indictable and either way offences, whereas it is merely an option in summary offences. The motivation for requiring defence disclosure lies in claims that it would improve both "quality of justice and efficiency in its administration", potentially leading to earlier guilty pleas, improved timetabling, and may in some circumstances even result in the prosecution dropping the case. Once introduced, there emerged a feeling amongst the police force that disclosure officers would be encouraged by greater enforcement of defence disclosure. As a result, the CJA extended the scope of material to be disclosed. This is suggestive of a regime where defence disclosure is reparation for the arduous duties imposed on the police, rather than one focussed on establishing the truth. <fnote>s 5 CPIA </fnote><fnote>p 708 Leng R Losing sight of the defendant: the Government's proposals on pre-trial disclosure (1995) Crim LR Sept pp 704 - 711 </fnote><fnote>para 6, p 222 Zander M, Note of Dissent in The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice Report Cm 2262 HMSO, London, 1993 </fnote><fnote>Chief Constable Sir David Phillips cited at p 190 Epp J Achieving the aims of the disclosure scheme in England and Wales (2001) 5(3) E & P pp 188 - 198 </fnote>On a theoretical level, it appears difficult to align the duty of defence disclosure with the justice theories which underpin the legal system. While the much cited view of Lord Justice Auld is that requirement of defence disclosure offends neither the principle that the prosecution must prove its case nor that a defendant is not obliged to inculpate himself, many commentators take issue with the extent to which the defendant is required to participate in the legal process. Zander argues that "it is not the job of the defendant to be helpful either to the prosecution or to the system. His task ... is simply to defend himself". It was initially argued that detailed disclosure by the defendant would increase the value of secondary disclosure, where the prosecution were required to consider unused material which supports the defence's case as outlined in his statement. Since this incentive has been removed, it is difficult to argue that a defendant would willingly sacrifice his right to put the prosecution to proof without assisting them. It is possible to argue that efficiency is in the best interests of the defendant, particularly where a swift judgement will clear the name of an innocent defendant, but this should not jeopardise the right to a fair trial. In this respect it is unfair to demand a defence statement which will inherently do more than merely clarify the issues to be disputed before the court. If 'a criminal trial is not a game', then the prosecution should not be given a 'sporting chance' by being forewarned of the weaknesses in its case. <fnote>para 154, chapter 10 The Right Honourable Lord Justice Auld Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales HMSO, London, 2001 </fnote><fnote>para 2, p 221 Zander M, Note of Dissent in The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice Report Cm 2262 HMSO, London, 1993 </fnote><fnote>The prosecution's duty is now ongoing (s3 CPIA) and consideration of material which assists the defence is no longer conditional on his defence statement (s 7A CPIA). </fnote>In practice, the defendant was initially required to disclose the nature of his defence, the matters on which he took issue, and his reasons for doing so.

The defendant must now additionally disclose any particular defence on which he intends to rely and must indicate any point of law or authority on which he intends to rely. This is a potentially large and detailed amount of information, which is required to be disclosed within the restrictive 14 day time limit, and may be considered unfair and disproportionate when compared to the 70 days afforded to the prosecution. The difficulty with this level of disclosure is the extent to which it relies on prosecution disclosure. It invites speculation as to the way in which the prosecution will use their evidence, and in some cases it will not be possible for the defence to state the reason it takes issue with the prosecution case. <fnote>s 6A (1)(a) CPIA </fnote><fnote>s 6A (1)(d) CPIA </fnote><fnote>Regulation 2, The Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (Defence Disclosure Time Limits) Regulations 1997, as set under s 12 CPIA.

In this respect, the right to a fair trial has to be considered broadly, encompassing events before trial. The level of detail required in the defence statement creates an opportunity for the police to deconstruct or tamper with the defence case. This is particularly poignant with regard to defence witnesses; s6C CPIA requires that the defendant supplies the name, address and date of birth of any witnesses he intends to call. The justification that such disclosure would prevent ambush defences through the use of surprise witnesses is discredited by Zander. His empirical research reveals not only are ambush defences rare, when they do occur, few serious problems result. As such, even if it were appropriate to require the defendant to assist the prosecution with the preparation of its case, this measure would be considered disproportionate. <fnote>p 710 Leng R Losing sight of the defendant: the Government's proposals on pre-trial disclosure (1995) Crim LR Sept pp 704 - 711 </fnote><fnote>p 824 Zander M Advance disclosure (2002) 146(35) SJ pp 824 - 825 </fnote>The consequence informing the police of the defence's witnesses is that they may wish to interview them. It is possible that this may extend to the police taking this as an opportunity "to browbeat, cajole or wheedle the witness to change his evidence or, failing that, not to testify for the defence". The potential for the truth to be masked in this way was recognised at the key stages in the development of the law in this area. Although disclosure of defence witnesses did not form part of the original CPIA, the Consultation Document on Disclosure preceding the legislation stated that "a nominated defence witness should not be interviewed by the police pre-trial unless suspected of involvement in that or another offence". Debating the introduction of the obligation under the CJA, Lord Dholakia noted that <fnote>p 824 Zander M Advance disclosure (2002) 146(35) SJ pp 824 - 825 </fnote><fnote>p 710 Leng R Losing sight of the defendant: the Government's proposals on pre-trial disclosure (1995) Crim LR Sept pp 704 - 711, referring to Consultation Document on Disclosure, May 1995 </fnote><quote>"[i]t is not too difficult to imagine ways in which the police may seek to help a defence witness to "refresh" his memory, possibly to "lose" his memory, of events.

Once more faith was placed in the propriety of the police, although some regard was had to the protection of the truth in the form of s21A CPIA. This states that the Secretary of State "shall prepare a code of practice" giving guidance to those interviewing defence witnesses. Despite the use of the imperative, the government's intentions seem disingenuous given that such a code has yet to materialise. Thus, even if it is possible to argue that disclosure of witness information does not undermine the right to a fair trial per se, the current safeguards against potential abuse in individual cases are not sufficient. <fnote>s 21A(1) CPIA, inserted by s 40 CJA </fnote><fnote>para 12-71a Archbold Chapter 12 - Privilege, Public Interest Immunity and Disclosure, III. - Disclosure, B. - Legislation Sweet and Maxwell, 2006 - "[n]o defence witness interview code had been laid before Parliament as at September 1, 2006" </fnote>There is also concern as to the possibility of unfairness during the trial. Commenting on the provisions as introduced by the CPIA, Sprack raised the question of "should the prosecution be allowed to put [the defence statement] in evidence as part of its case?", highlighting in response that this would be a serious derogation from the privilege against self-incrimination. Amendments under the CJA such that a defence statement is presumed to be given with the authority of the defendant, and Sprack's analysis of the case law on evidential routes suggest that introducing the statement in this way may be possible. To do so would be of great unfairness to the defence and could have a detrimental effect on the detail contained in the defence disclosure statement. This would mean that at the very least the prosecution were provided with a vague defence statement which is not in line with a government policy promoting disclosure. Ultimately, the defence may feel forced to omit certain information from the statement and run the risk of sanction through the drawing of adverse inferences. <fnote>p 313 Sprack J The Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996: Part 1: The Duty of Disclosure (1997) Crim LR May pp 308 - 320 </fnote><fnote>s 6E (1) </fnote><fnote>p 315 note 68 supra </fnote><heading>Enforcement of the defence disclosure obligations</heading>Shrouded in rhetoric about maximum disclosure, compliance with the disclosure regime is argued to be in the defendant's best interests. Nonetheless, it was felt necessary to compel defence disclosure under s5 by making provision for adverse inferences to be drawn under s11 CPIA. The grounds for such inferences are enumerated in s11(6), and on the face of it the pitfalls of defence disclosure seem vast. This may go some way to explaining the fact that where the defendant may provide a defence statement under s6, he does not chose to do so considering that he will be equally subject to the possibility of adverse inferences. <fnote>Magistrate </fnote>Of particular concern is the fact that "[i]t would often be difficult to determine whether it was the defendant's or his lawyers' failure to comply". The use of s6E CPIA to create the rebuttable presumption that the defence statement was issued with the authority of the accused does little to protect the defendant from inferences where the statement was issued late. In these circumstances it is difficult to determine the precise nature of the appropriate inference to be drawn, and thus it is difficult not to create undue prejudice against the defendant. <fnote>para 181, ch 10 The Right Honourable Lord Justice Auld Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales HMSO, London, 2001 </fnote><fnote>p 447 Redmayne M Criminal Justice Act 2003: (1) Disclosure and its Discontents (2004) Crim LR 441 </fnote>The propriety of drawing adverse inferences was considered in the context of the right to silence. In Murray v UK the ECtHR held that the drawing of "reasonable inferences" did not have the effect "of shifting the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defence so as to infringe the principle of the presumption of innocence." In this respect the potential sanction does not undermine the defendant's right to a fair trial. The regime also recognises and responds to the need for safeguards. Firstly, s11(4) states that where the defence at trial differs from that in the defence statement, the court will consider any justification for such difference. To this is added s11(5) CPIA: the defendant cannot be convicted on defence evidence alone. As such, the defendant retains the possibility of exonerating himself. <fnote>[1996] ECHR 3 </fnote><fnote>Ibid at para 54 </fnote><heading>Conclusion</heading>It would be a discredit to the criminal justice system to state that the disclosure rules wholly undermine the defendant's right to a fair trial, but the obligations of defence disclosure remain questionable. Weakness also lies in the failure to protect the defendant against abuse of process; the provisions leave ample scope for the police to hide information should they wish to do so. If maximum disclosure is to be embraced as the government suggests, then it may in fact be more appropriate to consider an investigative system of justice. While it remains adversarial, the state must recognise the inherent imbalance and realise that justice is best achieve through adequate protection of the defence. <fnote>p 461 Redmayne M Criminal Justice Act 2003: (1) Disclosure and its Discontents (2004) Crim LR 441 </fnote><heading>Research Memorandum </heading>My research started by considering the opportunities for empirical research. I relied on a previously established working relationship with a WPC at a police station near my home town, as well as getting in touch with a personal contact who sits as a Magistrate at Norwich Magistrates' Court. For background on issues before the court, I spent a day in the Magistrates' Court, observing a variety of cases which involved procedural matters. What soon became apparent was the use of the court for timetabling matters, and the delays that were inherent in the system as a result of the poor availability of evidence, and general difficulties with the preparation for a hearing. On this basis I decided to focus my essay on disclosure. After re-reading lecture notes, I used the online library resources to search for reported cases which echoed my concerns with the disclosure regime. From that point, it was then possible to find case notes as well as journal articles on the recent legislative reforms. Generally my research relied on a research trail using sources cited in other articles. A search of  Library provided several books on evidence in the criminal process, as well as one specifically on disclosure. I was fortunate to be able to use the library at the University of East Anglia to source relevant books that were not available at . Having read through the available material and formulated my essay question, I emailed several brief questions to my two contacts. They responded with their general impressions of the system, and were key in shaping my approach to the essay. I also telephoned firms of solicitors who had represented clients at court. I was provided with contact email addresses for three solicitors, to which I sent further questions. To date, I have not received a reply. The internet was a key source during the writing of my essay, especially in order to find government reports and consultation papers. LexisNexis Butterworths was particularly useful for legislation. Some wider searches however, did not provide the information sought. A search for the Code of Practice for Interviewing Defence Witnesses was particularly frustrating - while consultation closed 10 th December 2004, there is no evidence of a document. Re-reading of books showed that sources from 2006 still refer to the document as 'being drafted'.
