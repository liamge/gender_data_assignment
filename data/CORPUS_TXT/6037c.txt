<heading>Objectives</heading>The aim of this experiment was to determine the number of living bacteria in a foodstuff. In order to do this, the most appropriate method for enumerating the bacterial flora of a food had to be selected, taking into account the anticipated number of bacteria. <heading>Introduction</heading>There are two main types of methods for enumerating the bacteria in food, total count methods and viable count methods. The total counts methods counts both the living and dead bacterial cells, whereas the viable counts method only counts the living organisms, through their visible growth as colonies. For this experiment, four different techniques are used for the enumeration of the viable bacteria. For each of these procedures, a suitable representative sample must be selected. Also the bacteria must be accessible for counting so the sample may need to be homogenised in a sterile liquid first. The concentration must be at an appropriate level to the sensitivity of the counting method and a reliable counting technique is necessary for obtaining results. <heading>Materials needed</heading><list>Stomacher10g minced beef pre-weighed in the stomacher bagGilson Pipetman pipette1 ml and 0.1 ml sterile plastic pipette tips1 × 10 ml wide-bore sterile pipette3 × 1 ml wide-bore sterile pipetteSterile Universal bottleBeaker90 ml Maximum Recovery diluent5 × 9 ml Maximum Recovery diluent3 × 100 ml Plate Count Agar tempered at 50°C in a water bath3 × 100 ml VRBGA tempered at 50°C in a water bath12 × PCA plates12 × 10 ml Lauryl sulphate tryptose broth with Durham tubesSterile Petri dishes × 20 (12 for PCA and 8 for VRBGA)Plastic spreading rod</list><heading>Method </heading>Refer to p20 of the practical schedule for a more detailed method Throughout the method use of aseptic technique is required. <heading>Dilution of the sample</heading>Homogenise meat with sterile MRD in a stomacher for 1 minute and then transfer 7-10 ml of liquid from the meat into an empty universal bottle. (This is a 10 -1 dilution) Make 10 fold dilutions, from 10 -1 to 10 -6 by taking 1 ml sample of the supernatant and transferring it to 9ml of maximum recovery diluent and mix. Make sure a fresh pipette is used for each dilution. <heading>Pour Plate Method with PCA</heading>Label plates and add 1 ml of each of the dilutions from 10 -6 to 10 -1 to sterile petri dishes. Add 20 ml of molten agar to each plate shake gently and allow agar to set before incubation at 30°C for 48 hours. <heading>Spread Plate Method (Viable count)</heading>Pipette 0.1 ml volumes of the 10 -6 to 10 -1 dilutions onto plates of pre-poured plate count agar. Spread the inocula over the entire surface of the plate using a sterile spreading rod. Allow inocula to absorb and incubate plates at 30°C for 48 hours <heading>Pour plate method for Enterobacteriaceae with VRBGA</heading>Label plates and add 1 ml of each of the dilutions from 10 -4 to 10 -1 to sterile petri dishes. Add 10 ml of molten VRBGA into each sample and mix the sample. Cool and allow to set, then overlay with a further 10 ml molten VRBGA and allow to set. Incubate plates at 37°C for 24 hours. <heading>Presumptive Coliform Count by the MPN Method</heading>Label bottles with dilutions and pipette 1 ml of 10 -4 to 10 -1 into each of 3 tubes of Lauryl sulphate tryptose broth. Incubate tubes at 37°C for 24 hours. Tubes that have coliforms will show production of gas. <heading>Results</heading><heading>Pour Plate Method with PCA</heading> FORMULA  <heading>Class Results</heading><table/>Mean colony count of class: 380  FORMULA  <heading>Spread Plate Method (Viable count)</heading>10 -6 Dilution: 24 colonies and 24 colonies  FORMULA  <heading>Class result</heading><table/>The class result for the mean count per gram was 5.28×10 8 <heading>Pour plate method for Enterobacteriaceae with VRBGA</heading>10 -3 Dilution: 39 colonies and 40 colonies  FORMULA  <heading>Class Results</heading><table/>Class mean at a 10 -4 dilution  FORMULA  <heading>Presumptive Coliform count by the MPN Method</heading><table/><heading>Conclusion</heading>To conclude, all the viable counts methods showed large numbers of colony forming units. The high numbers of colony forming units per gram of mince may have been due to the mince being stored for 3 days before testing and maybe the storage of the mince, i.e. in the fridge. A source of error in the experiment may have been the dilutions itself. The 1 ml that was transferred for each dilution may not have been an exact measure. This error would have affected all the results as successive dilutions were carried out. The pour plate PCA method had an 8.3% confidence limit of the colony count. This method was simple but only the highest dilution could be examined and counted because on the lower dilutions there were too many colonies to count. However when results of the class were taken into consideration, the 95% confidence limit as a % of the count was reduced to 2.4%. This meant the width of the confidence interval was reduced, which created a more accurate result. The spread plate method showed a small increase in the colony forming units compared with the PCA pour plate but they were still of the same factor of 10 8. This method was very quick, however a sample size of only 0.1 ml was used. In this method, thorough spreading should be ensured. The pour plate method for Enterobacteriaceae showed pink/purple colonies with haloes of precipitate bile salts. However these were present in lower number than expected, especially my result of 3.95×10 4 mean count per gram. The low count was due to the clumps of cells not being broken up and the microorganism may not have been well dispersed. The class average however was larger at 2.91 × 10 5 per gram. There may have been a problem with the violet red bile glucose agar not being mixed properly as some of the agar at the lower dilutions had turned a yellow colour. The presumptive Coliform count by the MPN Method showed the mean most probable number of coliforms per gram of minced meat was 3195. Difficulties in this method were found in observing if the Durham tube had a positive or negative result. Another problem was when all 3 tubes had a bubble. This result was not conclusive when the result of 3-3-3 was observed. The MPN per ml of the lowest dilution was > 240. <heading>References</heading>Adams, M.R and Moss, M.O (2000) Food Microbiology. 2 nd Edition Royal Society of Chemistry Prescott, L.M, Harley, J.P & Klein, DK (2002) Microbiology. 5 th Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York  URL  [02 November 2005] <heading>Questions</heading>1) Colony counts /g or colony forming units (cfu) /g are a better indication of colony counts rather than total viable counts /g. This is because it is sometimes not possible to be certain that each colony came from an individual colony. In this case, it is best to refer to the colonies as colony forming unit/g. 2) It was impossible to calculate the lowest level of contamination (number of bacteria per gram) of mince detected by spread plating 0.1 ml of the 10 -1 homogenate onto PCA because the number of colonies were too numerous to count. Reasons for why the colonies were too numerous to count are explained in the discussion. However the lowest level of contamination can be calculation on the 10 -5 dilution plate.  FORMULA  3) Advantages and disadvantages of the spread plate and pour plate methods for estimating total aerobic colony counts. <list><heading>Spread plate method</heading>AdvantagesEnsures aerobic conditionsAvoids thermal heat shockDisadvantagesSample size usually limited to 0.1Colonies tend to clump is spreading is not thorough.</list><list><heading>Pour plate method</heading>AdvantagesDetermines oxygen requirementSample more likely to be evenly distributedDisadvantagesCan cause thermal heat shockDoes not ensure aerobic conditions</list>4) The factors that affect the precision of the colony count are:- <list>The width of the 95% confidence limitsThe larger the width of the confidence interval, the less precise a count is. The number of colonies in the sampleFor the best result, a sample should have a yield of between 30 - 300Distribution of the coloniesThe bacteria must be properly mixed to ensure that the colonies do not clump togetherAseptic techniqueA more precise colony count will be achieved with proper use of aseptic technique.</list>5) Coliforms are gram negative, facultative rods that ferment lactose with gas formation. The coliforms include, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Enterobacteriaceae is a family that contains gram negative rods, which are non motile and are facultative anaerobes and have simple nutritional requirements. The Enterobacteriaceae family can be divided into two groups, based on their formation properties. The genera in the family include Escherichia, Klebsiella and Enterobacter. 6) Presumptive counts are found on the probability or assumed number of organisms. Conformation that the colonies on the VRBGA are members of the Enterobacteriaceae is shown by pink/purple colonies with halos. The purple colonies are caused by the fermentation of lactose, which cause the bile salts in the VRBGA to precipitate out. There is also production of gas during the fermentation which displaces the LSTB Durham tube and the gas is visible as a bubble at the top of the inverted tube.
