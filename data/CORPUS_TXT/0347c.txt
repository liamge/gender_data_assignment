<heading>Introduction</heading>This project has been based around the simple principle of learning about basic Car Aerodynamics, and how car bodies can be designed and tested to reach optimal performance, without the extensive use of full prototyping i.e. by use of computer simulation software. An introduction to Solidworks has already been performed, so this knowledge can be improved by introducing another Program: CosmosFloWorks, which will enable the designs in Solidworks to run and solve calculations for velocity and pressure amongst others. However, the investigations of this project shall be based around discovering the Drag Force and hence the Drag Coefficient at different wind speeds, and attempting to use this data to develop the initial car design. Therefore, the objectives for this Project are to: <list>Learn the basic concepts of fluid dynamics and car aerodynamics;Learn about design philosophy and approach with use of computer software;Perform basic analysis and optimisation techniques, with use of computer software.</list><heading>Theory</heading>After having been given the initial Briefing sheet, a varied selection of equations can be recognised, that will be needed in order to reach a sensible analysis. <fnote>Given in the accompanying CD </fnote>Density (of air at sea level, T = 288.16 K):  FORMULA  Drag force:  FORMULA , which comes out of the tests as "X Component of Force" Afront: Frontal (silhouette) area of the car (a constant) Dynamic Pressure:  FORMULA , which can be calculated for each individual wind velocity tested. Drag Coefficient:  FORMULA , which will be plotted against Velocity during analysis, to compare whether the design alterations have been effective. <heading>Running the Software</heading>Through use of the instruction sheet, a tutorial of the set up of CosmosFloWorks can be obtained, in order to initialise the basic project, for example, by specifying that the tests should be carried out using SI units, ensuring that it is using air values for fluid, where the surface of the car is regarded as smooth and therefore negligible, and the geometry resolution is small so that a fairly accurate picture of the airflow patterns can be obtained. <fnote>Tutorial On CFD Analysis of Air Flow Around Car Using Solidworks </fnote>After this, the Inlet Velocity face and speed can be determined. This is where the variation in velocity for each run is inputted. The wind must be coming from the front of the car, so the correct wind tunnel face must be selected. This is repeated with the Static Pressure opening, which will be at the rear face of the vehicle. <picture/>In Figure 1, it can be seen that the red arrows at the front plane are the Inlet Velocity face, and the blue arrows are the Static Pressure Opening face. After this, the surface goals must be selected, whereby each face of the car, apart from those directly joint to the wind tunnel face should be selected, so that when the software runs, it knows which surfaces represent the car. The calculation can then be solved, during which iteration graphs can be obtained, and various surface plots of the velocity and pressure within the wind tunnel, as affected by the structure of the car. Once completed, the solver calculations are converted into Excel and Word documents that represent all of the results. <fnote>These results are available in full in the accompanying CD </fnote>The two versions of the car to be tested are available for view in the Accompanying CD. The idea of testing one car first was to design the second car so that it was an aerodynamically improved version of the first. The data analysis will aim to prove this. <heading>Analysis and Discussion</heading>To analyse the results that were obtained, the drag coefficient will need to be found. Given that the density of air is a constant 1.23 kg/m3, likewise the frontal area is constant: measured at 2.732m 2, and the Velocity is decided by the inputted Inlet Velocity, this means that the Drag Force must be the value that will be measured to find the Drag Coefficient. By using the iterated X Component of Force the Drag Force for each set of results can therefore be found, by using the previously discussed formula  FORMULA  <fnote>Full results are available in the accompanying CD </fnote>Figure 2 shows a summary of the results that were used to obtain graphical analysis of the car design. <table/>Hence, Figure 3 shows the graphical representation of these results. As seen, these results at least show some difference between the two designs. <figure/>The lower the Drag Coefficient, the higher the efficiency of the car's movement will be. This means that around the 30ms -1 velocity region for both sets of data, the movement of the car is more efficient, and reduces drag. The second design's line of best fit is also lower than the line for the first design, which can also be seen in the results table Figure 2. <heading>Conclusions</heading>The analysis is fairly conclusive, in that an improvement in car design has been achieved. However, there is much space for improvement and increase in experimental accuracy. Some faults in the experiment were that the computational software did not have enough time to solve each run for as many iterations as it needed to get the most accurate final answer, as there were limits applied. Also, the frontal area of each car was estimated given the dimensions - there was no simple way of working this out. If more repetitions were carried out, then a more definite graphical representation would be attained; as it stands, any 'peak' is entirely averaged. Ideally, this routine would be continued until a design was reached whereby it would be difficult to find any further improvements in aerodynamic efficiency. The final tests for ultimate streamline would have to take into account the Bernoulli equation, which suggests that at the greatest possible aerodynamic peak, the Dynamic Pressure is equal to the Static Pressure, therefore there being no energy losses due to air resistance.
