<heading>Section One</heading><heading>1 Game Report</heading><heading>1.1 Introduction</heading>In the previous production simulation game, I with other three colleagues took over a firm which manufactured electronic car aerials, the firm was named Green. Through 12 weeks' operation management, the green company had £353924.77 final cash, and final worth was £388376.77, although it had a small sum of total penalties of £422.40. With limited space, the analysis of production schedule was only to surface. In this section, I will explain our group's original objectives and strategy firstly. Then, I will continually concentrate on the analysis of production schedule for next 11 weeks (from week 25 to week 35) but take a step further by adding new points and new analysis model to complement the inadequate areas in which the analysis may have not sufficient done. <heading>1.2 Game Review</heading><heading>Objectives and Strategies for game level one</heading>It is no doubt that the primary objective of one company is making profits. Initially, we decided on two objectives, financially focused and customer focused, one was got maximum profit in twelve weeks; another was met customers needs completely. At a glance on these objectives, they were not clear, immeasurable and contradictory. Because if we wish to maximize our profits, it means that we have to take some actions to control all kinds of cost, such as reduction of level of inventory which may lead to fail to satisfy customers demand. Taking into account the conditions in this game that a penalty is 12% of the sales value of under-delivered goods and the cost of holding inventory is only 0.5% of the value for both raw materials and finished goods, we rebuilt our objectives that: get 30% ROCE (return on capital employed) in twelve weeks in the precondition that totally satisfy customers' needs. There are two measurement indicators to assess our performance and show if we have achieved the objectives which we had decided before. One is total penalties, and another is total balance. In order to achieve our objectives, we decided our strategies as follow: Production smoothing Use day shift Hold high level of finished goods inventory to meet customers' requirement Hold adequate level of raw material inventory to reduce inventory cost e/lb Before the beginning of game level one, we should consider customers' demand, breakeven point of each shift and capacity. Demand pattern The study of historical data pointed out that the demand of STD model varied greatly from 1845 units/week at the lowest to 1491 7units/week at the highest. Meanwhile, there was a peak demand every four or five weeks. This year, average sales of first twelve weeks were 6229 units/week compared to 5371 last year, increased by approximately 15%. So, we forecasted this year aggregated demand can be expected to be 5371*15%=6179 units/week. Breakeven points Next, we needed to decide how many products we should sell to cover all costs. As to day shift, basic cost=fixed cost + day shift semi-fixed cost=37k+23k =60k, contribution/unit = selling price - variable costs = £45-(£1 5+£1 0) =£20, so the breakeven point=basic costs/contribution=3000units. Accordingly, we can get the breakeven points of night shift, Saturday shift and evening shift, the numbers were 1512, 715 and 163 respectively. Capacity planning Our maximum capacity is 8350units/week, which can not meet the highest demand. So we have to produce more products when the market demand is lower and hold high level of finished goods inventory as a butter to meet the peak demand in the future. In game level one, our strategy was successful as a result of low unit cost, no penalty and low raw material stock holding cost. <heading>Change in game level two</heading>In game level two, we decided to change our strategy slightly to raise higher level of inventory and add night shift, because suppliers became less reliable, and production lost had to be consider due to scrap, rework and machine down time. At the end of game level two, there were two problems raised. One was that our unit cost was almost as high as price we sold, reached to £43.06/unit which made our company unprofitable. Through analysis, there were two reasons which led to this result, first reason was production lost which was uncontrollable factor, and second was adding of night shift which was controllable factor. In fact, we only produced average 1500 units weekly by night shift in this four weeks, it can be totally replaced by Saturday shift plus evening shift which were more inexpensive and flexible. Another problem was stock value. In week 18, the value of stock was £595799, which meant that we not only spent much money for inventory cost, but also lost interests that we can earn from deposit account. So, our strategy in game level two was not successful, we lost a lot of money, although we met all customers' requirement. <heading>Change in game level three</heading>In game level three, the game introduced a new product XL model, and the initial demand for the new product was estimated to be about half of that for the standard model, approximately 31 00units/week. Although capacity-related costs had changed a little, it is necessary to adding nigh shift now, because the average total demand increased to 9300units/week. We also decided to adjust inventory level to adequate level, so we can achieve our financially focused objective. Unfortunately, a penalty occurred at week 24 with a small volume of 64 under-delivered XL model units as a result of wrong forecasting and low inventory. Obviously, the changes of strategy for level three were not fully successful. Overall, our strategy was successful, but not fully. By the end of week 24, we meet our financial focused objective, but fail to our customer focused objective due to once penalty.. <heading>Improving in realistic</heading>It is definitely possible to successfully meet both the customer focused and financially focussed objectives, if we take some actions as follow: Better Forecasting We can employ all kinds of forecasting methods, and compare them, then select two or three methods which are suitable for our products pattern. Communication with customers 50% of turnovers sell to only an OEM; we can communicate friendly with it, even get collaboration. If it is possible to share information about its production schedule, it is useful for our production schedule. Find more reliable supplier No one can assure stable products supply, but if we can contact several suppliers, it is helpful to reduce the risk of shortage of raw material, accordingly decline inventory holding cost. • Quality control Production lost such as scrape and rework is a major factor which is responsible for the increase of unit cost. If good quality control process can be employed to reduce defects, we can earn more profit. <heading>1.3 Inventory control by EOQ</heading>Economic Order Quantity is a traditional scientific method to control inventory. It explains that how to find the best balance between the inventory holding cost and order cost which is key problem in the area of inventory management, through unsophisticated formula based on a couple of assumptions [1]: The demand rate is constant, and Stock is replenished as soon as it is depleted. Also, the formula looks like this: Qo = EOQ=(2CoD/Ch)＾ 1/2 which is the result of minimizing total variable cost. If we know the total demand for a period of time (D), the total holding cost/item in the period of time (Ch) and the total costs of placing an order (Co), we can get the optimal order quantities (Qo). <figure/>What the figure 1-1 shows is that when value of order quantity is low, the inventory holding costs are low, but order costs are very high because of high frequency of placing orders to meet needs; as order quantity increase, holding cost grow but order costs decline. Before the point of EOQ, the decrease of order costs is greater than the increase of holding costs, so total cost fall. However, after EOQ point, the situation is reverse, the decrease of order costs is less than the increase of holding costs, so the total cost starts to increase. EOQ is the point where the total cost is the lowest. According to Pareto's theory, the inventory items can split into three categories labelled A, B and C where A items constitute 20% of the volume and 80% of the money, B items represent 30% of the volume and 15% of the money and finally C items represent 50% and 5% respectively [2]. EOQ model pays attention on controlling inventory of class A because of the high value. In order to improve inventory control and reduce costs, EOQ indicates that class A should be small order quantity and place an order very frequently, while class C should be large order quantity with little frequency of placing orders. In reality, EOQ ignores the effect of labour cost and machine cost. For example, when the numbers of orders increase, we have to add people to manage orders which increase labour cost. So a trade-off should be considered when we apply EOQ model. <heading>1.4 Application of EOQ in Syndicate Company</heading>In our syndicate company, the EOQ model is appropriate to be used in particular items, although there are many unrealistic assumptions. The analysis is as follow: In the period from thirteenth week to twenty-fourth week this year, the total demand for standard model is about Df= average weekly demand*12= 61 79*12=74148units. The demands of three kind of raw materials are determined by finished goods demand and production lost. So the total demand for each raw material is D=Df*(1 +10%) =81 562units. Because our strategy in game is production smoothing, which means we keep stable capacity of approximately 6500units/week. So, former order quantity q for each raw material is about 6500units/week. Because the cost of holding inventory per week is estimated to be 0.5% of the value of raw materials, the twelve weeks holding cost is 6% of the value. Also the ordering cost is £50 per order. Now, we can calculate economic order quantity and total cost, and compare with former cost in syndicate company. <table/>From table 1-1, it is easy to see that the total cost with EOQ reduce to £4381 compared to £4725 of syndicate cost by increase the frequency of deliveries for high value items and reduce the frequency of deliveries for low value item. However, the game rule constrain frequency of delivery, a modification has to be done for the EOQ model. We can use Q+ policy, which means increasing the Qo to amend time interval. The reason why we can use Q+ policy is the robustness of EOQ model. Any relatively small deviation from EOQ will not increase total cost significantly [1]. The table 1-2 shows the result after modification. <table/>Actually, in this game, EOQ can be only used in accessories stock in where the decrease of order cost is greater than the growth of holding cost, so the total cost decline. Every two weeks, we can place an order of accessories with 6797u n its. <heading>1.5 Master Production Schedule and Material Ordering Plan</heading><heading>1.5.1 Introduction</heading>Master Production Schedules are planning devices, statements of what can and should be made. They also are approach to balance customers' demand and production capabilities [3]. In the process of producing a MPS, there are several questions I have to consider, how many goods we need to produce? How to arrange shifts? What are the safety stock requirements? So my mind map in this particular case as follow: <heading>1.5.2 Forecast Demand</heading><figure/>The first thing should be considered is forecasting customers' demand. There are a number of forecasting methods which are mainly divided into two basic categories, qualitative techniques and quantitative techniques. The distinction between the two kinds of forecasting techniques is if data exist. Because the historical data exist, quantitative forecasting methods, exponential smoothing method are selected in this game. <heading>Forecasting by Simple Exponential Smoothing Method </heading>In general, the formula of simply exponential smoothing method is given by [4]  FORMULA  As for the forecasting of Std. model from week 25 to week 35, initial values are shows as follow: Previous forecasting value Ft is calculated by the average demand from week 21 to week 24 = 7000units Smoothing constant α = 0.5 Forecast shows in figure 1-3: <figure/>Demand for new product is estimated to be about half of that for the Std. Model, so the needs of new product and total demand of the two set of products can be calculated and showed in table 1-3 <table/><heading>1.5.2 Rough Capacity Analysis</heading>A capacity planning will affect greatly the production performance in the aspect of products cost, inventory level and flexibility. The decisions of capacity planning will follow three steps [1]. First, we should measure aggregate demand and capacity. Then, identify the alternative capacity plans and next choose the appropriate capacity plan. <heading>Step one: measurement of demand and capacity</heading><heading>Cumulative demand</heading>Cumulative graph is a simple and effective technique to planning and control capacity. According to forecasting of demand, we can draw the demand profile and cumulative sum graph as follow: <figure/><figure/>From the figure 1-4, it can be seen easily that there are some significant fluctuation week on week. The cumulative graph indicates a balance between the customers' demand and the requirements of the production facility. In figure 1-5, we need to produce 10200units per weeks during first five weeks; the residual products produced in week 27 can meet the peak demand in week 28. Then, a production rate of 7800units per week can be applied for next six weeks to totally meet the requirements of customers. <heading>Aggregate capacity</heading>In this case, the total capacity can be calculated by Day shift + Night shift + Sat. shift + Eve. Shift *5 = 12700units/week <heading>Step two: identify capacity planning </heading><heading>Breakeven analysis</heading>Breakeven analysis indicates the points of balance between revenue and expenditure. It can help operation managers to decide that how many products should be manufactured in order to cover expenditure and earn profit. Breakeven point for Std. Model Day shift breakeven point= (37000+27000)/ (45-14-1 5) =4000units < maximum capacity (6000units/week) Night shift breakeven point= 25000/ (45-18-15) = 2084units < maximum capacity Sat. shift breakeven point = 16000/ (45-20-15) = 1600units > maximum capacity Eve. Shift breakeven point = 3400/ (45-20-15) = 340units/shift = maximum capacity Breakeven point for XL Model Day shift breakeven point = (37000+ 27000)/ (55-14-16) = 2560units < maximum capacity Night shift breakeven point = 25000/ (55-18-16) = 1190units < maximum capacity Sat. shift breakeven point = 16000/ (55-20-1 6) = 842units < maximum capacity Eve. Shift breakeven point = 3400/ (55-20-16) = 179units/shift < maximum capacity <heading>Identify alternative plans</heading>When a rough capacity plan is decided, a 10% production lost should be considered due to the effect of scrap, rework and machine down time which can not be ignored. For various reasons, production smoothing policy should be applied. Combination the analysis above, some appropriate plans can be produced. During week 24 to week28 Total projected yield/week = average customers' demand + 10% production lost = 10200 + 1020 =11220units/week <list><heading>Optional plans:</heading>day shift + night shift + Sat. shift + one eve. shift = 11340units/week(max)day shift + night shift + 4 eve. shift = 11360units/week(max)</list>During week 29 to week 35 Total projected yield/week = average customers' demand + 10% production lost = 7800 + 780 = 8580units/week <list><heading>Optional plans:</heading>day shift + night shift = 10000units/week(max)day shift + sat. shift + 5 eve. shift = 8700(max)</list><heading>Step three: choose appropriate plans </heading>One capacity plan in which the units cost would be lowest will be selected by financial analysis. Compared the expenditure and income of different plans, a conclusion can be drawn: Between week 24 and week 28, the second plan that day shift + night shift + 4 eve. shift should be selected. Between week 29 and week 35, the first plan that day shift + night shift should be selected. <heading>1.5.3 Inventory Analysis</heading>This company is a make-to-order manufacturer. Generally, it pays more attention to finished goods inventory. During the eleven weeks, the highest forecasting of demand will occur in week 28 with 14342units, but our maximum capacity is 12700units/week, which can not satisfy customers' requirements. So, safety stock should be considered in MPS in order to meet this peak. Balancing the penalty and inventory holding cost, a high level of inventory police is adopted. In this case, the gap is 1500units. We also need an allowance in safety stock. The safety stock can be set 2000units and divided into Std and XL models, 1 300units/week and 700units/week respectively. <heading>1.5.4 Master Production Schedule</heading>After the analysis of demand, capacity and inventory, some decisions can be made to produce a MPS. In first five weeks, a production rate 11360units/week (7360units/week for Std. model and 4000units/week for XL model) will be adopted, with day shift plus 4 evening shifts. Safety stock is set by 1 300units. In next six weeks, a production rate 8700units/week (6000units/week for XL model and 2700units/week for XL model) will be adopted, with day shift plus night shift. Safety stock is set by 700units. Owing to the constraints of initial inventory and lead time of accessories, we have to do a little modification in week 25. <table/><table/>Available (t) = MPS + available (t-1) - demand Adjusted for SS = available - safety stock It can be seen that all the demand can be satisfied, but the indicator of adjusted for SS sometime is negative which can be changed by raising capacity of production. Actually, we should monitor the performance of MPS and modify it weekly. <heading>1.5.5 Bill of Material</heading>The bill of material specifies the makeup for each part in the end item; it answers the question that what ingredients do we need to make a finished good [6]. In this case, the BOM is simple and displayed in figure 1-6 and 1-7 <figure/><figure/><heading>1.5.6 Inventory File</heading>Before producing a material ordering plan, we should consider the initial inventory, EOQ and safety stock. s/lsc Staring inventory levels: Main Bodies =9100; Aerials =9900; Accessories =13400 e/lsc Due to the constraint of frequency of delivery, EOQ can not used in this situation. Because the suppliers are not reliable, so, we have to hold a reasonable safety stock <heading>1.5.7 Material Ordering Plan</heading>Main bodies, aerials and accessories are dependent demand in this game which will be determined by quantities of finished goods which will produce weekly. Combining the MPS, BOM and initial inventory level, we can get the material ordering plans. <table/><table/><table/><heading>Section Two</heading><heading>a) Answer</heading>Forecasting aims to improve quality of decisions. Generally, a forecasting approach involve in several steps as follow [6]: <list>understand the objective of forecastingidentify significant factors which affect forecastsdetermine the appropriate forecasting techniquesmonitoring forecasting system</list>In the case, there are two kinds of products for different customers. On the one hand, the OEM's demand for completed units is fairly steady, on the other hand, the demand of other customers for individual components vary in time and quantity. So, two forecasting systems are required for different market demand. <heading>Forecasting approach for OEM's demand </heading>The objective of this forecasting is to respond the change of OEM's demand as quickly as possible. The demand is fairly stable, but it is possible that there is some slight change during each order quantities. It is appropriate to choose exponential smoothing method to forecast the OEM's demand, because exponential smoothing can arrange a weight for actual data and old forecast to chase the error of the forecast just made. In the general case, the formula of exponential smoothing method is given by:  FORMULA  <list><heading>Where:</heading>Ft+1 = new forecast next periodXt = actual number from previous period (t) Ft = previous forecast of period (t)α= Alpha smoothing constant</list>In fact, the value α used in the formula is a trade-off between response and smoothing. The increase of value α means that old data is quickly ignored and new data will get more weight. Once the customers' demand fluctuates, accordingly the value of forecasting will respond quickly to match actual demand. When the value α decrease, the average value will smooth and respond slow for noise. So, if we maintain original OEMs' demand, a small value of α should be applied to smooth random noise, while a big value of α could be applied when new OEM customers entry, in order to match customers' demand quickly. <heading>Forecasting approach for other customers </heading>As to other customers, the historical demand pattern is random without any trend and seasonality. Randomicity is a highlight characteristic. The forecasting objective is to filter the effect of random fluctuation and meet major customers' requirement. Moving Average could be adopted in this situation, because the average can remove the random effect over a great deal of observations. The formula of moving average generally looks like [4]:  FORMULA  <list><heading>Where:</heading>Mt = moving average at time t Dt = data value at time tn = number of observations</list>In the perspective of average, high values and low values could counteract each other. Then, result will trend to keep around average. In this way, error of forecasting is inevitable. As to the number of observations n, we can select big value and whole data can be considered. The curve will become smooth so that we can meet major customers' needs. <heading>Combining Forecasts</heading>Each individual forecasting method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Generally, a forecast can be improved by combing separate forecasts obtained by different methods. Moving average and exponential smoothing are quantitative method, so it is good idea to combine a qualitative method in order to improve forecasting result. In the forecasting for two type of customer, both of them could combine Delphi method. Delphi can overcome the disadvantages of personal interest by group. Anonymity, iteration with controlled feedback and statistical group response are three characteristics in Delphi method [7]. For the second pattern of customers, for example, perhaps advance orders, advertising, marketing mix and development of technology would change the demand, so adding a subjective method is helpful to improve quality of forecast. <heading>Monitor performance </heading>There are two results in forecasting, wrong or lucky. So, once a forecasting approach has been set up, it is necessary to monitor the performance of forecasting approach. Trigg's smoothed error method is very popular. His tracking signal is defined as the ratio of the exponentially smoothed error to the mean absolute deviation, which simply shows the deviation of demand, negative or positive. Once error become bigger, forecasting system should break down and be modified [8]. <heading>Safety stock to fulfil the demand </heading>One of major functions of inventory is as buffer to absorb any unexpected fluctuations in supply and demand. A high level of safety stock is required to meet other customers' needs in this case, but we should have a trade-off between inventory holding cost and shortage cost as well. Individual component is a make-to-stock product, while completed unit that is assembled by individual component is a make-to-order product. So, it is a good choice to have a higher individual component inventory level, and no safety stock of completed unit. Because, once OEM's demand increase slightly, it is feasible to assemble more completed units to meet the gap in one week if raw materials are sufficient. And once its demand has a little decrease, the material inventory projected for completed units can be used to meet other customers' requirement for individual units. <heading>b) Answer</heading>It is undoubted that an additional shift can increase production capacity. However, it leads to cost increase and some problems as well. The first additional cost is job training cost. It is necessary to train the recruits who have employed for the additional shift. Workers should understand clearly the process flow which they are responsible, the machines specifications as well as how to operate them, so that the workers can accurately use the machine and the production process can be effectively run. The second additional cost is machine maintenance cost. Long-term running of machines will lead to unreliable performance such as poor quality and breakdown. Increasing the frequency of equipment maintenance is essential to keep reliability and good performance of machines. Actually, while equipment is undergoing repairs, other costs may be incurred such as lost production, idle employees, etc. The third additional cost is management cost. A shift manager should be appointed in order to manage and coordinate the additional shift efficiently and effectively. He also is in charge of solving all problems which may occur during production, such as shortage of raw materials, equipment accidents, etc. Accordingly overhead will grow. One of problems led by adding a new shift is that shift schedule problem. Every week, operation manager has to determine which type of products and how many should be produced during the different shift. He also needs to have trade-off between shift costs and service levels. Adding an additional shift will make the decision process become more complicated. <heading>c) Answer</heading>In this company, the machinery is multi-purpose and production rates vary greatly. Machine reliability and set up time are variable from 1% and 30 minutes to 30% and 24hours respectively. Utilization of machines is very low. Obviously, this is a traditional manufacturer. An additional shift is only a short-term method to increase capacity. Some long-term methods should be introduced in order to improve productivity and completely meet the rapid growth of customers' needs. <heading>Option 1: Improve the exist procedure</heading>Although multi-purpose machines are available for a range of products and the breakdown of a particular machine will not halt an entire process and work can be transferred to other machines, they increase the movements of raw materials workers. The product can not move in sequence as well, because tooling has to be replaced between two types of products. The set up time is a great waste. So, rearranging the layout into cell layout is a good choice. In cell layout, machines are grouped and dedicated to a particular family of product [9]. Workcell is the heart of lean manufacture, and it can reduce lead time, simply material flow, and increase productivity greatly. The disadvantage of this method is that the cost of transformation is not inexpensive, company should pay attention to its budget, and otherwise it may get into financial problem. <heading>Option 2: Train employees</heading>It is a feasible and cheap way to improve productivity and increase capacity. Workers should own adequate skill for what they are in charge, poor skills will affect the whole production process as a bottleneck. As a result, the productivity would decrease. Company can offer some on-job training course in which staffs can reach an optimum level of skill and knowledge in their tasks. Indeed, high skilled employees form the backbone of a company, and they usually do big contributions to the growth of productivity. For example, high skilled machinist can maintain machines keeping stable and high reliability. The problem of this method is that if an employee resigns, company will lose their training expenditure and cultivate a professional for its competitor. <heading>Option 3: Improve quality</heading>Rework, scrap and all kinds of defects have negative effect in productivity, so quality improvement is a significant method for increasing production capacity. we can employ some advanced quality control methods such as six sigma. Six sigma project aims to continually improve process quality and reduce defects which include five steps: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC). A set of tools (charter, TMAP, process map, measurement system evaluation, VOP, etc.) can be used to guarantee the successful implementation of DMAIC. Project team will be responsible for the improvement of quality and control [10]. Many black belts and green belts which are a group of peoples, who are responsible for six sigma project, are required during the implementation of project. So, it is essential to combine six sigma and employee training plan. <heading>Option 4: Incentive scheme </heading>Recognition and reward system is an important method to improve performance and productivity. It should be quick, known, understandable and attainable as well as compatible with job measurements. If a reward system is unfair and unrealistic, it will have a negative effect on employees.
