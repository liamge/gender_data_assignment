<heading>Question 1: Newton Raphson</heading>(a)  FORMULA ;  FORMULA ;  FORMULA  (b) Please see attachment - page 1  FORMULA ;  FORMULA ;  FORMULA . <table/>(values in bold are values correct to 14 d.p.) Tolerance being used is 10^(-10). (c)  FORMULA  (at 6 th iteration with tolerance of 10^(-10))  FORMULA  - at different values of x 0 it converges to different roots. e.g.  FORMULA  after 15 iterations  FORMULA  after 24376 iterations  FORMULA  after 12 iterations  FORMULA  has a turning point at  FORMULA . depending on the sign of f'(x) (therefore the value of x) the Newton-Raphson method will find different roots for the equation  FORMULA .  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  If one of the iterating values gets close to  FORMULA  the next value for x will be very large number (or very small number), hence resulting in long iterations to get back close to the values of the roots (e.g. x0=1.02). (d) Please see attachment - page 2 <heading>Question 2</heading>(a) Please see attachment - page 2. The series converges to 0.35 (only correct to 2 d.p. with 3000 terms, and 0.3466 with 30000 terms). (b) Please see attachment - page 3. The second series added to the graph is:  FORMULA  (c) Two different partial sums of harmonic series:  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  The sum of first 3 n terms of series in part (a) have n positive terms 2 n negative terms (denominator of positive terms are odd and denominator of negative terms are even). Let's look at the n positive terms:  FORMULA   FORMULA  FORMULA  Let's look at the 2 n negative terms:  FORMULA  Therefore combining Sn+ and S2n- we get 3n terms of series in part (a):  FORMULA  But:  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  as  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  as  FORMULA  So the series in part (a) converges to  FORMULA , which is consistent to the answer we got in part (a) and consistent to the plot in part (b). Generalisation: p positive terms followed by q negative terms converges to:  FORMULA  (using a similar method: with  FORMULA  and  FORMULA )
