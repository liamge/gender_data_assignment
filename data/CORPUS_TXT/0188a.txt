<heading>1. Introduction</heading>The aim of this experiment is to investigate the rate of a chemical reaction, and see how this is dependant on the temperature. The reaction to be studied is the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in an acid permanganate solution:  FORMULA  In this experiment benzyl alcohol and the acid ion are present in large excess, and therefore their concentrations can be assumed to remain constant. Thus the only measurable concentration is that of MnO 4-, and the rate of its disappearance can be measured to ultimately form a rate equation for this reaction. The rate of disappearance of MnO 4- can be found by taking aliquots of the mixture at regular time intervals and adding potassium iodide to the mixture. This will remove all permanganate, and thus stop the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. This will liberate a proportional quantity of iodine:  FORMULA  The number of moles of liberated Iodine can be found by titrating the solution against a solution of standardised sodium thiosulphate.  FORMULA  The concentration of MnO 4- is thus known for a given value of time, and hence the order of reaction with respect to MnO 4- can be found. When the concentration of MnO 4- is plotted against time, we can see the reaction proceed as a function of time. If the reaction is first order with respect to permanganate then when examining the graph with a "half-life" method it is found that consecutive half lives are the same, this is only true for a first order reaction. If the graph is a straight line, then this means the rate of reaction is zeroth order with respect to permanganate ion. The overall rate equation can be written as:  FORMULA  Where a, b and c are orders of reaction with respect to their respective reagent and intergers to be determined. k is the equilibrium constant also to be determined. In this experiment, the concentrations of benzyl alcohol and permanganate are in excess, and can be assumed to be constant, thus what is observed is first order-pseudo rate equation:  FORMULA  K obs and c can be found by integrating the appropriate order rate equation, and plotting the relevant values. The order with respect to benzyl alcohol, and the acid are found from examining the results of different experiments. Once this has been done, the rate constant for the rate equation can be found by equating equations (4) and (5). There is a variation of k with temperature, Arrhenius in 1889 found a relationship that governs this whole concept:  FORMULA  where A is the pre-exponential (frequency) factor, E is the activation energy and R the molar gas constant. By manipulating this equation, it is possible (with different sets of values of T and k), to find A and E, by graphical means. <heading>2. Safety Procedures</heading>b <heading>3. Method</heading>180.0 cm 3 of benzyl alcohol solution (2.33 x 10 -3 mol dm -3 benzyl alcohol, 0.68 mol dm -3 sulphuric acid, 20% acetic acid, with dilution factor 180/200), was dispensed from a burette into a 500 cm 3 conical flask. 20.0 cm 3 of potassium permanganate (4.06 x 10 -3 mol dm -3) solution was pipetted into a separate conical flask. These two conical flasks were placed into a thermostat bath (at 32.5°C), and left to reach equilibrium for fifteen minutes. The potassium permanganate solution was then added to the benzyl alcohol solution. The stop clock was started immediately as these two solutions were mixed. A 10.0 cm 3 aliquot of the solution was taken from the mixture at t = 0 s. To which 10 cm 3 of 10% potassium iodide solution was added. This was then titrated against standard sodium thiosulphate (1.953 x 10 -3 mol dm -3). This procedure was repeated every ten minutes, until the permanganate concentration decreased to 25% of starting concentration (≈ 2.5 cm 3 of sodium thiosulphate titre). This experiment was then repeated for a thermostat bath at 27.5°C. <heading>4.0 Results - 32.5°C</heading><heading>4.01 Determining the order with respect to permanganate</heading>The titration results for this experiment are recorded in table 1. <table/>From this data, the molarity of remaining MnO4- was calculated, by using equations (2) and (3):  FORMULA  The number moles of MnO 4- = No moles of  FORMULA  The molarity of MnO 4- = no moles of  FORMULA  Example calculation (for t=0);  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  The complete calculations for all of these titrations are summarised in table 2. <table/>Plotting the concentration of permanganate against time, gives an exponential curve (see graph 1). This is characteristic of a first or second order reaction. Examining the graph using the half life method, the time from t 0 to t 1/2 is 2750s, and the time taken from t 1/2 to t 3/4 is 3000s. These consecutive half-lives are roughly the same, and this indicates the reaction is first order with respect to MnO 4-. <heading>4.02 Determining Pseudo Rate Constant</heading>The rate equation for this reaction can be written as:  FORMULA  Where a, b and c are integers, and c has already been deduced to be = 1. The concentrations of acid and benzyl alcohol are in excess, and therefore can be assumed to remain constant throughout the reaction giving a pseudo first order rate equation, which will have an effective rate constant k obs, this gives a rate equation as follows:  FORMULA  By manipulating the first order rate equation (7), a linear graph can be plotted. This will find the effective rate constant k obs. This is shown below:  FORMULA  Integrating with respect to t equation (7) on both sides gives (8):  FORMULA  Equation (8) is of the form: y = c - mx, and thus the gradient of the graph is = -k obs. To obtain k obs a graph of ln[MnO4-] vs time was plotted, using the manipulated data from table 3: <table/>The equation of the line of best fit from graph 2 was:  FORMULA  Thus determining the k obs = 0.000254 <heading>4.03 Determining the Rate Constant</heading>The rate with respect to MnO 4- has been deduced, but those with respect to H+ and C 6H 5CH 2OH have yet to be. K obs is the observed rate of reaction with respect to MnO 4-. To deduce the rate of reaction for benzyl alcohol and acid, it is important to consider the following information: <quote>"If the concentration of benzyl alcohol is doubled, it is found the half life of MnO4- is halved." "If the concentration of benzyl alcohol is doubled while that of the acid is halved, the overall rate of reaction is unchanged."</quote>From (i) it is deduced that order of reaction with respect to benzyl alcohol is first. The knowledge of (i) implies that from (ii) the order with respect to the acid is also first. Thus a = 1, b = 1, and c = 1 in equation (4). The rate constant for this reaction can then be found, from combining equations (4) and (5), using the starting concentrations of reagents.  FORMULA  substituting the following values will give rate constant k at 32.5°C:  FORMULA  <heading>4.1 Results - 27.5°C</heading><heading>4.11 Determining The Order With Respect To Permanganate</heading>The titration results for this experiment are recorded in table 4. <table/>From these results the concentration of remaining permanganate was found as previously state in section 4.01 using equations (2) and (3). These results are tabulated in table 5. <table/>From this, the concentration of permanganate can be plotted as a function of time (graph 3), which is exponential. The time taken from t 0 to t 1/2 is 4000s, and time taken from t 1/2 to t 3/4 is 8000s. These consecutive half lives are precisely the same, indicating the reaction is first order with respect to MnO4-. <heading>4.12 Determining Pseudo Rate Constant</heading>The pseudo rate constant can be found as in section 4.02, by taking natural logarithm of the concentration of MnO4- (as calculated in table 6), and plotting against time. <table/>The equation of line of best fit from graph 4 is:  FORMULA  Thus the gradient of the graph is = -0.000178, hence:  FORMULA  <heading>4.13 Determining the Rate Constant</heading>We know that the rate equation is:  FORMULA  As discussed earlier a, b and c are all equal to 1. Also from combining equations (4) and (5) the rate constant for the reaction temperature can be found.  FORMULA  substituting the following values gives k at 25.5°C:  FORMULA  <heading>4.2 - Variation of the Rate Constant with Temperature</heading>Using Arrgenius' equation (6) it is possible to obtain the activation energy and pre-exponential factor of the reaction.  FORMULA  Data from other groups were collected, so that as many values of K and T could be used to calculate accurate values of A and E. By taking natural logarithms of both sides of equation (6) gives:  FORMULA  The natural logarithm of each k value was calculated, as was 1/T. This would thus give a straight line graph, with gradient = E/R and intercept = lnA. The values of k and T were manipulated so graph 5 could be plotted; these results are seen in table 7. <table/>The equation generated from graph 5:  FORMULA  This means  FORMULA  Also  FORMULA  Thus  FORMULA  <heading>5. Mechanism</heading>From the rate of the reaction, it is known that one molecule of acid, one molecule of benzyl alcohol, and one molecule of permanganate are involved in the mechanism of this reaction. Also the rate determining step is said to involve the breaking of a C-H bond. The proposed mechanism is shown below: <figure/>Although Mn 2+ is not formed from this mechanism, it is believe it is formed with further reduced by oxidation of benzyl alcohol. <heading>6. Conclusions and Summary</heading>In this experiment two values for a rate constant at different temperatures have been found; 0.000254 mol -2 dm 6 s -1 and 0.1034 mol -2 dm 6 s -1 at 305.5 K and 300.5 K respectively for the following reaction:  FORMULA  The overall rate equation was deduced to be:  FORMULA  This reaction is overall third order, and first order with respect to acid, benzyl alcohol and permanganate. This lead to the conclusion that one of all these species was involved in the mechanism, instead as the stiochiometry equation (1) would lead us to believe. The proposed mechanism has the rate determining step breaking a C-H bond: <figure/>Some sets of K and T data were collated and produced a graph to find A and E using Arrhenius's equation (6). The values of A and E were found to be 248.152 and 20.08 KJ mol -1 respectively. The values of k obtained experimentally, appear to be quite low since it is said they should be between 0.1 - 0.4. This may be due to inaccuracy in the experiment, or poor experimental practise. The major inaccuracy in this experiment may be due to the reagents (such as benzyl alcohol) are prone to breaking down over a period of time when heated. Thus the titration results could have been affected by this. The temperature of the thermostat baths were monitored for every titration and were completely consistent. Also the graph generated by manipulating Arrhenius' equation is very unclear and the plots are very spatially distributed. Thus the equation of best fit is an estimate at best, implying results for A and E are inaccurate.
