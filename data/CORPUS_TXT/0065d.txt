He is the primary carer</list><heading>Analysis of history</heading>Pain arising in the hip is felt mainly in the groin and in the front or inner side of the thigh. Pain is often referred also to the knee and can sometimes be the predominant feature. In contrast, the 'hip' pain that is referred from the spine is felt mainly in the gluteal region, where it often radiates down the back or outer side of the thigh. True hip pain is made worse by walking, whereas gluteal pain referred from the spine is aggravated by activities such as stooping and lifting, and is often eased by walking. In this case, however, weight bearing was not possible, let alone walking or stooping. Other joints to examine - Pain in the hip area may be due to pathology in the lumbar spine, sacroiliac joints, abdomen or pelvis <heading>Physical examination</heading><list>Patient uncomfortable in bedLeft leg shortened, externally rotated and adducted.No active movementPain on all passive movementTenderness over left hipNo sensory deficit</list><heading>Analysis of history and examination</heading>Examination findings of a shortened, externally rotated hip, with pain on movement and tenderness over the left hip, strongly suggest a broken hip. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s)</heading>This 89 year old lady has suffered from a serious fall that has left her with a broken hip requiring a major operation. This has severely affected her health status and no doubt this has hugely impinged on her mobility and made her more dependent on her son in both the short term and long term. She may well need extra help from social services. The psychological distress here extends not only to Mrs , but also to her Son who is the primary carer and will also be at increased risk of developing depression and other health problems. <heading>Management</heading><heading>Investigations</heading>Bloods for - U&E, Glucose, FBC, X-match X-rays - Both AP pelvis and lateral hip x-rays of the suspected side are essential. Careful scrutiny for disruption of the trabeculae, inferior or superior cortices, and abnormalities of pelvic contours (shenton's lines). Fractures of the femoral neck are not always visible on initial x-rays. Repeat x-rays, bone scanning or even MRI may be required if symptoms continue. Intracapsular neck of femur fractures may be graded radiologically according to the Garden classification. <heading>RESULTS:</heading>x-ray - subcapital fracture of left neck of femur + pubic rami fracture of the right hip ECG - nil acute <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading>Mrs , I'm afraid the x-ray findings have confirmed that you have broken your hip and will be requiring some major surgery to replace the hip joint <heading>Prescription/medical intervention</heading><list>Assess vital signs. Treat with Haemaccel, but beware incipient heart failure. If present, monitor CVP. Obtain IV accessStart IV infusion if indicatedRelieve pain - Give IV analgesia plus an antiemetic; provide all analgesia IV in small increments every few minutes until pain is controlledX-rays - a good quality lateral is essential to make the diagnosis if there is impaction or little displacement.Arrange admission to orthopaedic wardPrepare for theatre: FBC, U&E, CXR, ECG {to look for arrhthmias or evidence of MI}, crossmatch 2 units, consent. Tell the anesthetist about any drugs the patient is taking.In theatre - If displacement is minimal, either multiple screw fixation, or Garden screws. (sliding nail plate units are not used for intracapsular fractures). Alternatively, the head is excised and a prosthesis is inserted. In Mrs 's case, this was a Left hemiarthroplasty.</list><heading>Observation</heading>Check for complications: <list>Ischaemic necrosis of the femoral head - supplied by the medial femoral circumflex arteryInfectionNon-unionHaematomaPEDVTPost-op anaemiaCVAMI</list><heading>Referral and team working</heading><list>Occupational therapistSocial workerPhysiotherapist</list><heading>Outcome</heading>Hip replacement undertaken, but developed post-op complications and has returned to hospital <heading>Evidence based care and issues for research</heading><list><heading>Garden Classification of Intracapsular fractures:</heading>Garden I - trabeculae angulated, but inferior cortex intact.
