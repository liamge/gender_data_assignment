<heading>Introduction</heading>This report analyses the motion of the car as it passes over a pothole on the road. The riding quality of an automobile relies on a combination of heave (vertical displacement) and pitch (angular displacement). Road irregularities are the main factor affecting ride quality. Suspension elements between the road wheels and the automobile body generate vertical forces, which incite both heave and pitch motions. The modelling and simulation of this dynamical engineering system is done and is given in this report. Using this simulation, the model's behaviour is studied extensively. The assignment explores the System Modelling and Simulation techniques using MATLAB and SIMULINK to understand the behaviour of the car on the road. <heading>Aim</heading>The aim of the assignment is to design and simulate a mechanical system based on the following series of stages: Derive a mathematical model of the dynamical engineering system. Use the mathematical model to build a simulation model using a continuous simulation tool. The mechanical system to be modelled is a car suspension system. A car incorporating this suspension system will travel along a flat and horizontal road surface (assumed) until it arrives at a pothole in the road. During the journey over the flat horizontal surface, the pitch (angular motion) and the heave (vertical motion) of the vehicle are unaffected. This however is not the case when the car is over the pothole as both the pitch and heave values are affected. This assignment studies the behaviour of the heave and pitch of the car, under varying conditions while it travels over the pothole. <heading>Description of the Model</heading>We are going to model a car going over a pothole on the road. A car would typically have four wheels attached to four separate suspension systems. But in this assignment we shall only consider two suspension systems of the car. We shall be studying the pitch and heave motions along the length of the car and hence consider two suspension systems: one front wheel suspension system and other is the rear wheel suspension system. The car model we shall be analysing in this assignment has been shown in figure1. <picture/>To correctly simulate a system it is essential to develop a mathematical model. The mathematical model consists of an accurate set of equations that best describe the behaviour of the mechanical system, which can then be used to simulate the system. As the configuration for both the front and rear suspensions is identical it is best to derive the mathematical model of one axel and then replicate it to represent the second axel. The two axels can then be combined to observe their affect on the heave & the pitch of the vehicle's centre of mass (centre of gravity COG). We can approximate the car suspension system to a simple mechanical system that consists of various elements whose behaviour can be modelled using mathematical equations. Figure 2 shows the approximate mechanical system. <picture/>The correct model of the system should have the following components with respect to the car and the road (should be considered on each axel): <list>Sprung mass (Car)Suspension (Spring-damper system)SpringDamperUn-Sprung mass (Axel)Road</list><heading>Mathematical Model</heading>The complete model for the car is shown in figure3.
