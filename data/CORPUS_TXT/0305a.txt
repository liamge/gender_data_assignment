<heading>Starting from Ampère's Law</heading>We begin with Ampère's Law, which is  FORMULA  (1.1) Set as the integration path a circle, with radius r, centred on the wire and in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the wire, with  FORMULA directed clockwise around this path (see Fig. 1.1).  FORMULA  is the outwards normal from the wire, and  FORMULA  is directed along the wire. <figure/>At each point,  FORMULA  is tangential to the integration path, so the angle  FORMULA  between  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  is zero. Also, splitting  FORMULA  into 3 components,  FORMULA  as both  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  are perpendicular to  FORMULA . So we only need to consider  FORMULA  in the following integral, which is constant at fixed  FORMULA  by symmetry, and so can be taken outside of the integration. Now we can apply Eqn. 1.1 around this closed path:  FORMULA   FORMULA  Re-arranging this, we obtain an expression for the magnitude of the magnetic field around the wire:  FORMULA  (1.2) Ampère's Law also determines the direction of  FORMULA  is in the clockwise direction, and so the positive current direction is into the page. The current is flowing in this direction, so the actual current is positive, and so B is positive, from Eqn. 1.2. The direction of positive integration is clockwise, parallel to  FORMULA , and so  FORMULA  must be clockwise as well, as shown in Fig. 1.2. <figure/> FORMULA <heading>2) Starting from the Biot-Savart Law</heading>The Biot-Savart Law is  FORMULA  (2.1) We set up the problem as shown in Fig. 2.1. From this, we see that  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . The right-hand rule for the vector product  FORMULA  shows that the direction of  FORMULA  is into the page (point the fingers of the right hand in the direction of  FORMULA , curl the fingers the direction of  FORMULA , and the thumb will point in the direction of the vector cross product, which in this case is the direction of  FORMULA ). Furthermore, all contributions to the magnetic field from all elements  FORMULA  of the wire are in the same direction (into the page). <figure/> FORMULA So now we can use Eqn. 2.1 to find the field  FORMULA  caused by an element of the wire of length  FORMULA  shown in Fig. 2.1. So we have  FORMULA . i.e.  FORMULA   FORMULA  (2.2) However, notice that from Fig. 2.1,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  So from Eqn. 2.2 we have that  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  So  FORMULA  (2.2) Again, notice that from  FORMULA  we get  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  So substituting this into Eqn. 2.3 gives  FORMULA   FORMULA  So  FORMULA  (2.4) When the length of the wire,  FORMULA , becomes much larger than its distance  FORMULA  to point P, then we can consider it to be infinitely long. Also, when  FORMULA  is much larger than  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  is approximately equal to  FORMULA . Hence, from Eqn. 2.4, we have that  FORMULA  (2.5) The situation is axially symmetric about the y-axis, so  FORMULA  must have the same magnitude at all points on any circle centred on the wire, and also  FORMULA  must always have direction at a tangent to this circle. Hence, at all points on a circle of radius  FORMULA  around the wire, we have  FORMULA , which is the same result as that obtained when the problem is analysed with Ampère's Law.
