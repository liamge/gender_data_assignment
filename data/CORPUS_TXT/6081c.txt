<heading>Introduction:</heading>Density is defined as mass/volume; Specific Gravity is (mass of substance)/(mass of an equally volume of water). The aim of these experiments is to measure particle density(or solid density), bulk density and porosity for apple, potato, peas and dried milk powder. In this lab report, I recorded the following 4 experiments: <list>Apple - Density, Average Diameter and VolumePotato - Density, Average Diameter and VolumeDried Peas - Particle Density, Bulk Density and PorosityDried Milk Powder - Bulk Density, Particle Density and Porosity</list><heading>Result and Calculation:</heading><heading>Apple - Density and Volume (displaced in water)</heading>The diameter of apple was measured in several directions. (See table below) <table/>As we know the equation for the volume of a spherical particle is: V = 4/3 π r3 Where r is the Average Radius of the apple  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  Substitute the r into the equation and assume this apple is spherical:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  As we measured, the mass of that apple is 149.05g. In that case, the Density of apple is:  FORMULA  However, the shape of apple is not spherical. In order to get a more accurate volume and density of the apple, the volume of the apple can be calculated by the amount of water it displaces. (the density of water is 1000 kg m -3)  FORMULA   FORMULA  This time we get the Density of apple is:  FORMULA  <heading>Potato - Density and Volume (displaced in water)</heading>The diameter of potato was measured in several directions. (See table below) <table/>The average diameter is 7.42cm, so the average radius is:  FORMULA  Assume this potato is spherical, and the equation known as: V = 4/3 π r3  FORMULA  As we measured, the mass of this potato is 210.96g. In that case, the Density of potato is:  FORMULA  As we mentioned above, the shape of potato is not spherical. In order to get a more accurate volume and density of the potato, the volume of the potato can be calculated by the amount of water it displaces. (the density of water is 1000 kg m -3)  FORMULA   FORMULA  This time we get the Density of potato is:  FORMULA  <heading>Dried Peas - Particle Density, Bulk Density and Porosity</heading>The diameter of one pea is measured in several direction. (See table below) <table/>The average diameter is 0.72cm, so the average radius is:  FORMULA  Assume this pea is spherical, and the equation known as: V = 4/3 π r3  FORMULA  As we measured, the mass of this pea is 0.009g So that it seems to be the Particle Density of this pea is:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  As we mentioned above, the shape of pea is not spherical. In order to get a more accurate Densities, we use a number of peas and displace them into water. See table below shows when we measure a number of peas: <table/>The Particle Density of peas is:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  The Bulk Density of peas is calculated by placing a known mass of material in a measuring cylinder and compacting it until a constant volume is obtained, which is 38ml and including air. The Bulk Density of peas is: ρb = mass / bulk volume  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  The porosity (ε) of a number peas can be calculated by the following equation:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  The peas were then be boiled in water for 15 minutes and their volume as well as particle and bulk density were recorder and calculated. <table/>The porosity of those boiled peas can be calculated using:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>Dried Milk Powder - Bulk Density, Particle Density and Porosity</heading>In order to calculate the bulk density of the dried milk powder 20g of milk powder was placed in a measuring cylinder and the cylinder was tapped gently until a constant volume was reached.  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  Determine the solid density using a specific gravity bottle: As it followed by the Handbook:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  Those values are measured and noted, see table below: <table/> FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  Therefore specific gravity of the solid is equal to:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>Discussion:</heading>The density of water is 1000kg/m 3, when a substance has a greater density than water, it will sink in water, where as those with less density than water will float in water. In the first experiment, the result show the apple should sink in water, but as we discovered, apple usually float in water, which means the density of apple should be less than water. In that case, the first way of calculating density is not accurate for apple is not spherical. It is the same theory for the second experiment. The density of a substance is equal to the mass of the substance divided by the volume that it occupies. There might be still some errors exist. The fact is, the density of a substance will change when the temperature is different. 'Density differences in heated fluids provide the driving force for natural convection.' (Taken from the course book, page 52) In a word, density decreases as a increasing in temperature. Bulk density is the density of the bulk material under these conditions which include the volume of the air:  FORMULA  In comparison, while we calculate Particle density, we do not count the volume of the air. Particle density refer to the density of an individual unit:  FORMULA  To be noticed, for the last experiment: Dried Milk Powder, the bulk density can be affected by the solids content of the feed, prior to drying and the suddenly inlet and outlet air temperatures. Porosity is the fraction of the total volume taken up by air. All in all, the relationship between porosity, bulk density and particle density is given by: Porosity ε =Volume of Air / Volume of Bulk sample  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  so:  FORMULA  <heading>Conclusion:</heading>In those experiments, we determined the density and specific gravity of a range of food by measuring the bulk density of solid and using specific gravity bottle to determine the particle density. What's more, this report help me understand the difference of Bulk density and Particle density, and the relationship of them and porosity.
