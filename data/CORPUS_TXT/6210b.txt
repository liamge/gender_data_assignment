<heading>Aim/Experimental purpose</heading>To prepare p-bromoaniline, by facilitating the mono bromination of aniline through the addition of a protecting acetyl substituent - this reduces the activating influence of the amino group. <heading>Reaction equation</heading><figure/><heading>Safety hazards</heading><list>Material HazardAniline Toxic, cancer suspect agentAcetic anhydride Corrosive, IrritantGlacial Acetic Acid Corrosive, irritantAcetanilide Unknown hazard, product of stage 1Bromine Highly toxic, corrosiveSodium metabisulfate Irritantp-bromoacetanilide Unknown hazard, product of stage 2Conc.

The mixture was allowed to stand for 5 minutes, and then diluted with water (~150ml) until crystallisation occurred (white precipitate formed), this was then filtered at the pump, washed with water and allowed to dry in air. The crude product was re-crystallised from ethanol, dried, weighed (4.53g) and the melting point taken (69-75 0c). <heading>Stage 2</heading>The purified acetanilide (4.53g) from stage 1 was dissolved in cold glacial acetic acid (25ml) in a 250ml conical flask. A solution of bromine (2.1ml) was made up in glacial acetic acid (30ml) and added to the acetanilide solution. The mixture was left to stand for 15minutes, and following this poured into cold water (300ml), (an orange precipitate was formed). The precipitate was filtered at the pump and returned to the original conical flask, this was stirred with further water (150ml) containing sodium metabisulfate (2g). This mixture was again filtered at the pump, left to dry and weighed (4.06g), 2.1g of this was taken onto stage 3. The remainder 1.96g was re-crystallised, using ethanol as a solvent, filtered at the pump, weighed (0.87g) and a melting point taken (174-177 0c). <heading>Stage 3 </heading>The 2.1g of p-bromoacetanilide was treated in a 100ml round bottomed flask with water (25ml), concentrated hydrochloric acid (25ml), and the addition of a few bumping granules. A condenser was fitted to the flask and following this the mixture was heated under reflux until the solid dissolved, heating for a further 10 minutes after the solid had dissolved. Subsequently the mixture was cooled on ice and 25% sodium hydroxide solution was added until the PH was alkaline. Cooling on ice and whilst scratching crystallisation occurs, this was then filtered at the pump. The product was re-crystallised from hot ethanol and the pure p-bromoaniline filtered at the pump, weighed ( 0.3g), and a melting point taken (61-65 0C ). <heading>Results</heading><heading>Criterion of purity</heading> FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>Percentage yields</heading><heading>Stage 1</heading> FORMULA  Theoretical yield  FORMULA  Percentage yield =  FORMULA  <heading>Stage 2</heading> FORMULA  Theoretical yield  FORMULA  Percentage yield =  FORMULA  <heading>Stage 3 </heading> FORMULA  Theoretical yield  FORMULA  Percentage yield =  FORMULA  <heading>Mechanistic equation for each step in the preparation of p -bromoaniline from aniline</heading>STAGE1 <figure/><figure/>STAGE 2 <figure/><heading>Why does the bromination of acetanilide stop at the mono-bromo stage?</heading>The bromination of acetanilide stops at the mono-bromo stage as the nitrogen atom in an amide is much less basic than in an amine as it is conjugated with the carbonyl group. Amine is more reactive due to the increased electron density in the ring however in the amide, nitrogen cannot donate electrons as effectively to the ring system due to the conjugation and hence substitution is far more controlled and ends at the mono-bromo stage. <heading>Why does this bromination occur only at the para - (4-) position?</heading>Bromination occurs only at the para position, as the substitution of bromine deactivates the benzene ring - withdraws electrons from the ring and therefore stops the resonance at the para position. In addition to take the ortho position the electrophile would encounter significant steric hindrance due to the large substituent e.g. amide, and hence the para position is more energetically favourable.
