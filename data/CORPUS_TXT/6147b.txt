<heading>METHODS</heading><heading>Study organsims </heading><heading>Aphids : </heading>The Acyrthosiphon pisum (Homoptera: Aphididae) clones were collected in Silwood Park, Berkshire, UK. All clonal lines used (S1, S4, S6, S21, S23, S24, S25, S26, S35 and S36) were reared from individuals collected and maintained in monoclonal cultures, isolated using clear PVC containers with a large gauze window. Three adults from four generations of each clone were placed and allowed to larviposit on, either Good quality or Poor quality plants for 2 days. Five replicates were made of each clone. Unless otherwise noted, all culturing and laboratory experiments were conducted at a constant temperature of 20± 1ºC and 16:8h light: dark regime at ambient humidity. <heading>Predators : </heading>Adult convergent ladybirds, Hippodamia convergens (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) were purchased from Koppert Biologicals and refrigerated. One day prior to the start of the experiment they were transferred to a 20± 0.25ºC incubator without food until required. <heading>Plants : </heading>The growth of broad bean plants Vicia faba (var. 'the Sutton dwarf') was accurately controlled through fertilisation to provide 2 different qualities of plant. Both were grown 2 seed per 15cm (diameter) pot with equal volume of sand and vermiculite. 'Good quality' plants were given 5ml of fertiliser (Phostrogen™) in 45ml water every 3 days for the growing period of 3 weeks. 'Poor quality' plants were given an initial 5ml dose of fertiliser in 45ml water, then subsequent 50ml of water every 3 days for the 3 week period. <heading>Study experiments </heading><heading>Aphid fecundity : </heading>using four treatments, involving the transfer of three apterous aphids to a combination of plant qualities: from good to poor, good to good, poor to good and poor to poor. These treatments were implemented for each clone individually and repeated five times. The experiment was limited to using apterous individuals due to good evidence that winged aphid morphs produce fewer offspring (Dixon 1998). The bean plants were at the 3-leaf stage. The number of aphid offspring was recorded after 3 and 7 days on the test plant. <heading> Aphid escape behaviour : </heading>twenty adult apterous aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) were placed onto bean plant cuttings at the 4-5 leaf stage. Each plant cutting had been secured in a glass vial containing water, the exterior of which was coated in fluon. The vial was fixed inside a 20cm diameter plastic dish, filled with fluon to trap aphids which dropped from the plant. The aphids were exposed to one of two treatments, a non-predator control group or exposure to a single adult Hippodamia convergens ladybird. Each vial was placed into an individual tray, which collected dropped aphids to be counted. The colonies were then left for 1h after which time the number of aphids that had dropped from the plant were recorded. <heading>Statistical methods : </heading>All analyses were performed using Minitab® 15 Statistical Software. Aphid fecundity was analysed using a three-way ANOVA and Aphid escape behaviour was analysed using a two-way ANOVA. <heading>RESULTS</heading><heading>Aphid fecundity: </heading>There was a significant effect of maternal plant quality (F 1, 115=23.01, P<0.001; figure 1), test plant quality (F 1, 115=23.34, P<0.001; figure 2) and clone (F 9, 115=5.03, P<0.001) on the fecundity of the pea aphids. All interaction terms were non-significant. <figure/><figure/><heading>Aphid escape behaviour : </heading>The interaction between clone and plant quality was significant (F 8, 65=4.03, P<0.001; figure 2). All other terms were non-significant. <figure/><heading>DISCUSSION</heading>Here, we have shown that mean fecundity of Acyrthosiphon pisium, is greater when on a good quality Vicia faba than when on a poor quality V. faba. This was supported with all clones, with one exception. Figure 2 illustrates that clone 23 had a higher mean fecundity on a poor quality test plant than a good quality test plant. This could be investigated further in future experiments to see if this is always the case with this individual clone and to what extent varying plant quality has on its rate of reproduction. Some clones can also be seen to be more affected by the varying plant quality when on the maternal plant, rather than the host, e.g. for clone 1 fecundity was markedly higher on the Good host than the Poor host, than when transferred to the test plant, where difference between the two plants qualities had a lesser effect on fecundity. Clones 26 and 36 however, showed a greater variation in fecundity; seeming more affected by plant quality, on their test plant. Overall the experiment did support initial hypotheses for fecundity-plant quality interaction, and correlated with existing information on the subject. Figure 3 compares the reaction of clones to the change of plant quality when placed on a test plant and shows there was great variation in the result of dropping behaviour observed between the different clones. Clones 1, 4, 6, 23 and 24 had a higher mean proportion of dropped aphids on Good quality plants, clone 21 showed a fairly even dropping rate and clones 25 and 36 had a higher mean proportion of dropped aphids on Poor quality plants; clones can be seen to act in a number of ways and each to a different degree. This is evidence for clonal diversity in pea aphids in relation to their behaviour and plant quality. Clonal diversity maybe maintained in a population if there is variation in relative fitnesses of clones, due to selection caused by variation in the environment (Vrijenhoek 1979; Maynard Smith 1980; Weeks & Hoffmann 1998). Clonal diversity may also be the result of recurrent formations of new clones. Both these processes are considered important regarding aphids because obligate and cyclical parthenogens can form mixed populations (Vorburger 2006). These results were not unexpected and similar examples have been provided in other studies such as those done with the aphid  Myzus persicae which has high genetic variation among clones in their performance on different hosts (Weber 1985, 1986; Edwards 2001; Vorburgeral. 2003). There maybe several reasons as to why some clones dropped more than others from each quality of plant, and these traits have evolved due to selection in the field. A benefit to a low dropping behaviour from a Good plant is a good food supply which may not be discovered again if an aphid reacts and leaves the plant. This theory is in opposition to the observation of other clones which showed higher dropping which could be due to their higher fitness (due to better quality sap) which may allow them to spend less time feeding. In contrast, aphids on Poor quality hosts may not be successful if time was wasted on unnecessary predator avoidance behaviour. Aphid colonies are dynamic in nature and the dominance of any particular clones is unstable due to changing environment, further samples would provide a wider picture of their clonal composition. This work provides further evidence that plant quality does affect aphid fecundity and dropping behaviour, and that intraspecific genetic variation can influence the outcome at an ecological scale.
