<heading>Question 1: A Population Model</heading>(a)  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA . Therefore, the 4x4 matrix equation is:  FORMULA  (b) Please see the attachment - pages 1 and 2. Two possible answers in the 20 th year: allowing fractions to represent population: 4.5498 10.7597 15.7211 7.7668 allowing only integers (so after each iteration take the nearest integer towards minus infinity): 1 2 7 3 (c) The eigenvector for the matrix, M (as used in m-file or 4x4 matrix above), which is almost a multiple of vector after 20 years is:  FORMULA  and  FORMULA = =  FORMULA   FORMULA  Explanation: After 20 years, we have applied matrix, M 20 times. Therefore the final vector converges to the eigenvector with the biggest eigenvalue, in this case 0.9530 compared to other 3 eigenvalues: 0.5600, 0.7840 and 0.2770. Since we can express all the vectors in terms of 4 eigenvectors and after we have applied matrix, M 20 times the eigenvector with the biggest eigenvalue becomes dominant to express the initial vector's image (0.9530 20=0.38 against 0.5600 20=0.0000092, 0.7840 20=0.0077 and 0.2770 20=0.0000000000071). <heading>Question 2: Magic Squares</heading>(a) Let  FORMULA  be a 3x3 magic matrix with row sum r. Then we have 8 sets of equations:  FORMULA  If we express it like: -  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  then we have the linear equations Mv = 0 as given in the Problem Sheet (just need to add 0's when the element is not in the expression) e.g.  FORMULA   FORMULA  1 st row of matrix, M multiplied by v = 1 st element of zero-vector, 0. (b) Please see the attachment - page 2. Let V, W be vector fields over R, with  FORMULA . And let  FORMULA  be a linear map, which corresponds to matrix, M. From the row reduced form of M (attachment page 2), we can see that  FORMULA  We have 10 variables in vector, v which implies that dim(V)=10. From Linear Algebra, we know:  FORMULA   FORMULA  Since we want to have Mv = 0, we need to find  FORMULA . But we know  FORMULA  There are 3 bases of Ker(T) Once three of the entries in v are chosen (therefore in a 3x3 magic square), other entries are determined uniquely. Let P be a set of all 3x3 magic matrixes ( FORMULA ) and Q be a set of 3x3 matrixes. We know Q is a vector. Since P is a subset of Q, it would be sufficient to show that:  FORMULA  FORMULA   FORMULA  FORMULA  Then the sum of the first row entries:  FORMULA   FORMULA  Similarly all the 8 equations can be shown to be equal to  FORMULA  Therefore W is itself a vector space. From earlier part of (b), we showed that Nullity(T) = 3. dim(P) = 3 as explained earlier on. (c) We know dimension of 3x3 magic matrix is 3, so if we can show M 1, M 2 and M 3 are linearly independent, we have showed they form a basis. Also we need to check they are 3x3 magic matrixes on their own right. r 1=3, r 2=0 and r 3=0; M 1, M 2 and M 3 are magic matrixes on their own right. M 1 and M 2 are trivially linearly independent. In order to get a 13 in M 3 we need to add M 1 and M 2, but that clearly cannot get a 12 and some other elements in M 3. Therefore M 3 is linearly independent of M 1 and M 2. M 1, M 2 and M 3 form a basis of 3x3 magic matrixes. (d) Please see the attachment - page 3 Similarly we get 10x17 matrix (or 16x17 matrix if we include "non-proper" diagonals), M such that Mv = 0. Using MatLab, we see  FORMULA  FORMULA . So there are 8 sets of 4x4 matrixes, which form a basis of all 4x4 magic squares. (or for 16x17  FORMULA  FORMULA . So there are 5 sets of 4x4 matrixes, which form basis of all 4x4 super-magic squares.)
