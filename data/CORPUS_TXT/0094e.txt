<heading>Introduction</heading>The supply-side macroeconomic debate between Keynesians and monetarists has continued throughout our post-modern time. The extreme Keynesian views about the shape of aggregate supply (AS) curve have been challenged as a result of the emergence of monetarist and moderate Keynesian thought. Most economists disagree with the extreme Keynesian view that the shape of AS curve is horizontal in the short run and vertical in the long run. This is a problem, because it would be beneficial for a government to know how the nature of AS affects the success of a chosen fiscal or monetary policy. Surprisingly, there is no absolute certainty about the shape of the short run AS curves. Moderate thinkers have tried to adjust the extreme Keynesian model of AS curve into a more empirically accurate form whereas the monetarists have challenged the fundamentals of Keynesian model. In this essay, the starting point for discussion is the extreme Keynesian view: vertical long-run aggregate supply curve (LRAS) combined with a horizontal short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS), which can be combined into an L-shaped curve. The underlying theory of such AS curves is explained below, followed by discussion of alternative views. In sum, I aim to challenge the extreme Keynesian AS model. Like all models, it is a rough representation of reality and due to its rigidity it is highly disputable. <fnote>This debate must be distinguished from Keynesian demand-side macroeconomics, which is more agreed upon. </fnote><fnote>Adapted from Glanville; 1997: 285 </fnote><heading>Aggregate Supply Curves: Extreme Keynesian Theory Explained</heading>According to the extreme Keynesian view, there is a vertical LRAS and a horizontal SRAS curve. The AS curve model plots the quantity of goods and services supplied in an economy at a certain price level. Alongside with aggregate demand (AD) analysis, AS can be used to investigate the relationship between price level (P) and real income (Y). Hence, the AD/AS model is an important tool for economists. Not surprisingly, the absence of unambiguous empirical data about AS is the main reason for controversy in supply-side economics. <fnote>Adapted from Mankiw; 2002: 245 </fnote><fnote>Ibid </fnote><heading>LRAS</heading>The vertical LRAS model was created by the classical economists; however, they were focused on explaining the long run only and not analysing short run economic fluctuations. The vertical LRAS is based on an assumption that in the long run prices are flexible and the economy's output will be at its full employment level (Y*). Clearly, this level of output can occur at various price levels (P), as illustrated below. <fnote>Ibid </fnote><figure/>Classical economists argue that in the long run "amount of output produced depends on the fixed amounts of capital and [labour] and on the available technology." This observation can be written: <fnote>Ibid </fnote><fnote>Ibid: 241, 245 </fnote>Equation 1  FORMULA  Where: Y= constant level of output, Y* = output at full employment level of resources, K = capital and L = labour. The function depends on technological process.  <fnote>Cf. Solow growth model </fnote>Therefore, P is independent of Y in the long run and P is determined by the level of AD at Y* level. Another important implication is that the production has a physical limit set by F(K,L). Given that all prices are flexible, it follows that the prices will adjust to any changes in demand. Although Keynes famously stated: "in the long run we are all dead", Mankiw states that most economists agree with the classical long run view. However, Keynesians argue that immediately adjusting totally flexible prices is too strong an assumption for the short-run analysis. <fnote>Keynes; 1923: ch.3 </fnote><fnote>Mankiw; 2002: 240 </fnote><heading>SRAS</heading>The Keynesians assume that the prices take time to adjust in changes in demand in the short run; "prices are sticky". I will use the assumption that all prices are fixed in the short run, which is consistent with extreme Keynesian thought. Therefore, the SRAS curve shown below is horizontal. <fnote>Ibid: 247 </fnote><figure/>In the above model, short-run changes in demand affect Y - the price level is fixed at P*.  <fnote>Ibid </fnote>Hence: Equation 2  FORMULA  Thus, the short-run case is the opposite of the long-run model. The LRAS and SRAS models have now been explained and it was shown that in the extreme model the short run output level is affected by changes in AD, whereas the long run output is not. The antithetical nature of these two models brings along questions: what happens when we move from the short-run to the long-run? The extreme Keynesian explanation is shown below. <figure/>P does not respond to changes in AD until Y*. The policy implication is that fiscal policy is effective and no complete crowding-out of private investment occurs. Hence, expansionary fiscal and monetary policies increase Y but not P in the short run. In Keynesian analysis, wages are important and I will briefly discuss the wage-price relation relevant to this debate. Given a perfectly elastic SRAS curve, it can be observed that if AD shifts outwards from 1 to 2, Y and wages (W) increase simultaneously. This can be clarified graphically: <figure/>As AD shifts from 1 to 2 in Graph C, the iso-wage curve shifts from W1 to W2 and given P*, W/P increases. Thus, wages are procyclical. However, this observation is based on L-shaped AS curve, which is a rigid assumption. Hence I will discuss alternatives to extreme Keynesian model. <heading>Alternative views introduced</heading>The extreme Keynesian view is based on strong assumptions and therefore its correlation with reality is reduced. Many academics have challenged the extreme Keynesian views on the AS curves, because there is controversial empirical evidence. The extreme model was developed further by the moderate Keynesians. <heading>Moderate Keynesian view</heading>The moderate Keynesian model challenges the extreme idea that P is completely insensitive of AD up to Y*. Moderate Keynesians developed an upward-sloping middle section to the model. They based that change on the observation that unemployment and rising prices showed strong correlation in 1950s and 1960s. Nevertheless, the moderate Keynesians believe that the markets will clear in the long run and their model is illustrated below. <fnote>Glanville; 1997: 279 </fnote><figure/>Above SRAS is plotted past Y*, right of LRAS. The underlying intuition is that in the short run the economy is able to produce at levels where e.g. all machinery is used beyond sustainable levels. In terms of wages, the model is the opposite of the extreme Keynesian model. There seems to be a trade-off between unemployment and inflation, which implies that real wages are countercyclical. If the economy booms, real wages diminish unless the economy produces at the horizontal part of the SRAS. Even though moderate Keynesian model accounts for overheating of economies and unemployment-inflation trade-off, it is not without limitations. Some of these limitations are pointed out by the monetarists. <heading>Monetarist ideas explained</heading>The classical economists believe that the markets will clear, as explained in the LRAS section above. Unsurprisingly, the extreme monetarists argue that it is justifiable to assume that the markets will work in the short run. Hence, the SRAS curve is vertical.  <fnote>Adapted from Glanville; 1997: 285 </fnote><figure/>This model corresponds to the classical view of economics - the invisible hand makes the markets work. Policy implication is that fiscal policy will lead into inflation only, full crowding-out occurs, but, monetary policy can be used to influence P. Changes in demand will only affect P but not Y. An interesting observation is that wages are acyclical (i.e. economic cycles do not matter as in the Keynesian model) - all markets clear and hence there is no unemployment. Nevertheless, there is evidence to support the argument that this is not the case in the short run - the reasoning behind the Keynesian thought. Their main opposition to the monetarist model is that short run situations are significant enough to be acted upon. <heading>The AS theories discussed</heading>Empirical evidence must be considered to evaluate the models above. It is clear that there is a little if any conclusive empirical research regarding the models. Before the evaluation, the condition for long-run equilibrium is established. In his work, Mankiw sets out equilibrium requirements graphically: <fnote>Mankiw; 2002: 251 </fnote><figure/>In all long-run equilibrium points, LRAS, SRAS and AD curve must intersect, such as in point (a) in graph G. In the graph, SRAS shifts from 1 to 2, causing an increase in price level to P*' and reducing output below Y* level. The new short-run equilibrium is at (b) - there is stagflation: unemployment and P have increased. According to Mankiw, these kinds of adverse supply shocks have been empirically observed and they have been caused by e.g. oil crisis in 1970s. Furthermore, Mankiw argues that a government can use fiscal and monetary policy to shift AD (in the graph from 1 to 2) and restore full employment level output at point (c). Though, the result is increased P. The policy implication is that the markets will not immediately adjust to supply shocks and the government can use demand-side policies to restore Y*. Interestingly, the horizontal model of SRAS as set in graph B was created based on observations about the Great Depression, where the markets did not adjust (rather than based on observations about 1970s crisis). <fnote>Ibid: 253 </fnote><fnote>Ibid </fnote><fnote>Ibid: 256 </fnote>In contrast, the monetarist ideas gained impetus during the 1970s oil crisis. In several countries, government demand-side policies seemed to fail and there was widespread stagflation. Monetarist explained the phenomenon by relating it to their vertical SRAS/LRAS model (see graph F above). Government attempts to increase AD were leading to an increased P only. In spite of widespread popularity of monetarist ideas and Milton Friedman's persuasive statement that "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon," monetarists have failed to find conclusive evidence to support their view. The limitation to their view is that there seems to be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. On the other hand, Friedman was content to argue that the trade-off is temporary and not permanent. <fnote>Blanchard; 2003: 152 </fnote><fnote>Friedman; 1956: 21 </fnote><fnote>Ibid: 23 </fnote>Moderate Keynesians argue that even if the trade-off between inflation and unemployment is temporary, it is significant enough. They believe that the adjustment process of markets takes unacceptably long - and that the short-run trade-off matters as illustrated below. <figure/>The upward sloping section in the model above indicates that there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Movement from AD1 via AD2 to AD3 shows increasing inflation and decreasing unemployment. In his work Blanchard sets out the AS relation for upward sloping section algebraically: <fnote>Blanchard; 2003: 136 </fnote>Equation 3  FORMULA  This model was created based upon the developments of 1950s and 1960s - empirical evidence from that time period supports the moderate Keynesian model and it was almost unchallenged until the emergence of the 1970s crisis and monetarist thought. The moderate Keynesian model seems more realistic than the extreme Keynesian, for two reasons. First reason is that the horizontal SRAS curve that Keynes observed during the Great Depression is accommodated in the moderate Keynesian model. The second reason is that the extreme Keynesian model cannot explain developments in the 1950s and 1960s and hence, it is too rigid a model to reflect the reality. In conclusion, I am content to argue that because of its higher correlation with empirical evidence, the moderate Keynesian view is superior to the extreme Keynesian view. <heading>Conclusion</heading>It seems inevitable that the academic debate about the shape of AS curves will continue further, because of the monetarist/Keynesian division. Nevertheless, it can be stated that horizontal SRAS curve combined with vertical LRAS curve is not very realistic view compared to its alternatives. In sum, there seems to be empirical evidence to give proof to all of the three models discussed above. It is interesting to observe how after several years of research the economic schools of thought disagree on some fundamental aspects of the AS analysis. Governments find themselves in a difficult position, because the models predict e.g. wage behaviour in different ways. Nevertheless, the extreme Keynesian view has lost many supporters and the academic consensus to the moderate view. I believe it is not a great exaggeration to say that the L-shaped model of the SRAS/LRAS curve is too rigid for the present day economic thought. However, it is clear that monetarists and Keynesians disagree, and the debate will continue for the foreseeable future.
