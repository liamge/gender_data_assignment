<heading>Referral information Source of referral and a summary of key information</heading>Mr  was referred to  Hospital,  on the  by his general practitioner (GP). The referral was made on the basis of worsening pain In Mr 's right-side chest wall. <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background. The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading><heading>Presenting Complaint</heading>Mr  had a 4-5 week history of pain in the right-hand side of his chest, which had been getting progressively worse. <heading>History of Presenting Complaint</heading>Mr  had been experiencing this pain for 4-5 weeks and described it getting worse. The pain was localised at the "top" of his chest and it radiated down to his waist. Mr  described the pain as a dull ache, which was always present. Mr  graded his pain 6-7/10 (10 worst pain ever experienced). Nothing relieved the pain but he had not taken any analgesics. Mr  became more aware of the pain when he was moving and if he coughed or sneezed the pain became more severe. Mr  had not experienced this type of problem before. There was no associated nausea or vomiting. Mr  was breathless on exertion (10 yards on the flat ground and going up the stairs) and did not have a persistent cough. There had been no haemoptysis. Mr  did not have a wheeze and did not use inhalers. There was no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea or orthopnoea. Mr  felt lethargic over the last month. There was no dizziness or loss of consciousness. Mr  did not have any palpitations. Mr  opened his bowels regularly, he had lost 3lbs in the last 2 weeks and his appetite was good. There was no constipation, no diarrhoea and no malaena. Mr micturated frequently but there was no pain on urinating; he had a history of an enlarged irregular prostate. <heading>Past Medical History</heading><list> Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - 2003Alopecia - 2003 - unknown causeTUPR - 2001HypercholesterolaemiaNo history of thyroid problems, rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy, asthma, myocardial infarction, stroke or TB. </list><heading>Current Medication</heading><list>Paracetamol - 1g qds Gliclazide - 90mg odFinasteride - 5mg odISMN - 20mg bdRamipril - 2.5mg odAspirin - 75mg odAmylodipine - 10mg odRosiglitazone - 4mg odLiquifilm tears</list>No known drug allergies. <heading>Family History</heading>There was no significant family history. <heading>Social History</heading>Mr  lived with his wife in a house and is an independent, mobile man. Mr  has 2 children whom he has regular contact with. Mr  is a retired electrical engineer. There was no exposure to asbestos or other occupational hazards. Mr  was an ex-smoker of 40 years, when he smoked 10/day for 25 years. Mr  drinks on average 6-8 units of alcohol per week. <heading>Analysis of history The most likely single cause of the presentation, other possible causes and reasons for these choices. The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>Based on the symptoms Mr  presented with, the differential diagnoses of right-sided chest pain, worsening over 4-5 weeks and on exertion are: Pleural Effusion: fluid in the pleural space, which can be divided into low protein content (transudate) and high protein content (exudates). They are often asymptomatic but patients can experience dyspnoea and a pleuritic chest pain. Transudates are due to an increase in venous pressure (such as from cardiac failure, constrictive pericarditis or fluid overload). Exudates are most likely due to an increase in the leakiness of pleural capillaries secondary to malignancy, infection or inflammation. Neoplasm: with clinical symptoms of a persistent cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, chest pain, anorexia and weight loss. Recurrent slowly resolving pneumonias are also a common feature. Pneumonia: consider atypical pneumonias, for example mycoplasma. Tuberculosis Trauma-related; rib fracture: Pulmonary Embolism: a clinical picture of acute breathlessness, pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis, dizziness and syncope. PEs usually arise from a venous thrombosis in the pelvis or legs. Clots break off and pass through the venous system and the right side of the heart before lodging in the pulmonary circulation. On physical examination, a full respiratory examination will be carried out; assessment of respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, breath sounds (bronchial breathing is often heard in pleural effusions). Listening to air entry and the presence of added sounds; crackles indicating infection or wheezes suggestive of airways disease. It is also important to look for signs of trauma and palpate for tenderness over the chest wall, which would be present if there was a rib fracture. An overall examination of Mr  will help build a clinical picture that may indicate a malignancy; palpating for lymphadenopathy should be carried out. <heading>Physical examination and mental state examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading>On general examination, Mr  was alert and orientated. There were no signs of clubbing, cyanosis, jaundice or lymphadenopathy. Mr  had pale conjunctiva. Capillary refill <2 seconds.

PR - sphincter tone normal, impacted stools, no malaena. </list><heading>Analysis of history and examination Reasons for your choice of the cause of the patient's problem(s) and any other cause that still needs to be considered at this stage</heading>Following examination, the most likely diagnosis for Mr 's presentation is a right-sided pleural effusion, possibly secondary to a neoplasm in light of the presence of hepatomegaly. The effusion could also be complicated by a chest infection suggested by the crackles heard on examination. The pleural effusion will need to be aspirated and sent for histology to determine whether it is an exudate or a transudate fluid. Exudative effusion (protein >30g/dL) can be caused by infection or malignancy. Malignant cells can be seen on cytology. It is important to rule out a malignancy as a cause for the effusion and Mr  requires a chest X-ray followed by a CT if a lesion is found. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>Physical - Mr  is physically able and independent. Since his chest pain started he has been finding it more difficult to carry out his usual tasks of daily living. His difficulty breathing also makes mobilising more difficult. Psychological - Mr  had become worried about his chest pain as it had been continuing for so long. He went to his GP because he was worried he was having a heart attack. Social - Mr  had support from his wife and family and was an independent man. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management. Refer to the guidelines to the writing of portfolio cases for the details of the issues to be addressed under each heading.</heading><heading>Investigations </heading>Mr 's blood results following admission on  were as follows: <table/>Mr 's biochemistry results following admission on  were as follows: <table/>CA19-9 (upper GI cancer marker) - normal, CEA marker - normal. Antibody screen - negative Mr  was cross-matched for a blood transfusion (normocytic, normochromic anaemia). Mr 's urea and creatinine results indicate he is in acute renal failure. <heading>X-Ray Chest</heading>"Large area of shadowing in lower right lung". <heading>Pleural Fluid Analysis</heading>LDH - 845: Total Protein 41g/dL i.e. exudative. Aspirate analysis: "Predominantly Neutrophils, scanty mesothelial cells, no malignant cells seen". <heading>Reassurance and Explanation</heading>To appropriately reassure Mr , I would say: "As you know, you have been experiencing some chest pain for a little while now. There are a number of reasons why you might have this chest pain and we would like to do some investigations whilst you are in hospital. The type of pain you are describing indicates to us that you may have some fluid collected in your lungs, which can be the result of a number of things. One of the things that can cause this problem is cancer in your lungs and we would like to investigate you for that possibility whilst you are in hospital. You do not seem to have any current risk factors for a lung cancer but you were a smoker in the past, which could have a role to play. We would like to carry out some blood tests, organise a chest X-ray and a CT scan. At the moment we will give you some oxygen to help with your breathing". To explain the nature of the disease: "Following your blood tests and X-ray, they confirm that you have a collection of fluid in your right lung. This is the most likely cause of your chest pain and breathing difficulties. Your blood tests also show us that you are very anaemic and we would like to give you some blood to help improve this. Having such a low haemoglobin level may also be another cause for your breathlessness. Your blood results also indicate that you have an infection, which is also most likely to be in your lungs. The cause of the fluid in your lungs could still be a result of a malignancy and we would like to investigate you further t rule this out". To describe the management plan: "Whilst you are in hospital we are going to carry out some tests to find a reason for the fluid in your lung. We would like to get an ultrasound of your tummy and a CT scan of your chest. We are going to aspirate your chest to get the fluid out of your lung, which we hope will reduce your pain and ease your breathlessness. We feel that your diabetes is not very well controlled so we are going to put you on an insulin drip and ask the diabetic nurse to talk with you about how to help you best control your sugar levels. Once we have the results of all of the tests we will be in a better position to tell you what has caused the fluid to collect in your lungs". <heading>Prescription/Medical Intervention</heading>Whilst in hospital, Mr  had a chest drain to remove the fluid in his right lung. He was transfused to improve his haemoglobin levels and he received fluids to treat is acute renal failure. Mr  was put on a sliding scale of insulin to better control his diabetes. Mr  was prescribed antibiotics to treat a suspected chest infection. <heading>Observation</heading>Following admission, Mr  was monitored for any further deterioration in his breathing and general health, for example the onset of a fever. His blood levels were monitored to check his haemoglobin levels were rising and his blood glucose was closely monitored to achieve a better diabetic control. Long-term observation will include diabetic follow-up; if his blood glucose has been uncontrolled in the past, it is possible it will decline again when he leave hospital. Observation in the primary care setting will be needed. <heading>Referral and Team Working</heading>Mr  was not referred to any other team during his stay in hospital. Team-working between the team looking after him in hospital and the diabetic nurses will be necessary to get improvement in his blood glucose control. <heading>Advice and Prevention</heading>Mr  should be advised with regard to his blood glucose control once he is at home. He should be given advice about his diet and when to take his medication. He should also be given information about the complications of diabetes if blood glucose is not well controlled. With regards to his chest pain, he should be advised to visit his GP if he experiences any more problems. <heading>Outcome A description of the progress of the patient as far as possible. This should include consideration of further issues to be resolved. Where appropriate you should contact by telephone patients who have been discharged home.</heading>Mr  remained an inpatient for over 1 week whilst the necessary investigations were carried out. Mr  had a confirmed diagnosis of a right-sided pleural effusion, most likely to be a reactive pleural effusion to a right lower lobe pneumonia. No malignant changes were identified. <heading>Evidence based care A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s)</heading><heading>Pleural effusions</heading>The pleural cavity is a potential space which normally contains little fluid. A pleural effusion is an accumulation of fluid within this pleural space. The fluid may be either transudative or exudative: a transudate results from an alteration in the hydrostatic forces operating across the pleural membrane an exudate results from a change in the permeability of the membrane due to inflammation A pleural effusion will only be detected: <list>on a chest radiograph when the volume of the effusion exceeds 300 ml clinically when the volume exceeds 500 ml</list><heading>Clinically</heading><list><heading>Symptoms:</heading>may be asymptomatic dyspnoea - dependent on size of effusion dull chest pain</list>Signs: there may be a displacement of the trachea and the lung apex away from the effusion if it is very large there is reduced movement of the affected side the site of the pleural effusion is dull to percussion; classical stony dullness is not a constant sign there is reduced vocal fremitus over a pleural effusion breath sounds are reduced or absent over a pleural effusion towards the upper part of an effusion there may be signs of consolidation i.e. bronchial breathing and bleating vocal resonance. Malignant pleural effusions indicate a late stage of lung cancer using the TNM staging strategy. Under the TNM classification, tumour staging at T3 implies a tumour of any size which is invading surrounding structures but not involving the heart, great vessels, oesophagus or vertebral body or a tumour within 2 cm of the carina but not involving the carina. T4 classification implies a tumour of any size which is invading any of the structures excluded from T3 and the presence of a malignant pleural effusion. (1) <heading>Management</heading>The effusion should be investigated by diagnostic aspiration and the fluid examined for protein content, cell type and bacteria. If the effusion is an exudate then a pleural biopsy is useful. If there is a large effusion then symptomatic relief can be achieved via aspiration of the effusion. A chest drain is an alternative to repeated aspiration - this must be able to drain the base of pleural effusion (1). A systematic review on the effectiveness of management for malignant pleural effusion investigated the best ways in which to carry out pleurodesis for malignant effusions. It concluded that bleomycin was effective in reducing recurrences and tetracycline (doxycycline) was not superior to bleomycin (2). The study also looked at strategies such as rolling the patients after instillation of the sclerosing agent, protracted drainage of the effusion and the use of larger chest tubes, which were not found to have any substantial advantages (2). <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>An important issue raised in this case includes the issue of breaking bad news with regards to a terminal diagnosis. There was no terminal diagnosis in this case but it was necessary to discuss the possibility that Mr  had a lung cancer. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading><list>Differential diagnosis of chest pain.
