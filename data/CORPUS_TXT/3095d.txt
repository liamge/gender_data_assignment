<heading>Introduction</heading><heading>Trend</heading>Over the past 40 years, the use of the private car has increased whilst public transport numbers have decreased at a similar rate. 83% of all journey are by car Bus journeys have dropped by 18.9% in the UK since 1984 (Commission for integrated transport 2004). This has led to a reduction in services and increased prices for public transport. <quote>'As a consequence (of the trend), overhead costs have had to be shared among a diminishing number of customers, leaving the operators with the choice of increasing fares, or reducing services, or, most commonly, both.' Adams (1981) p 86</quote>Today - system is strained - but in future it would get worse if current trends continue <quote>'If current trends continued, total urban traffic could increase by 40% over the next 25 years.' Ravetz (2000) p88</quote>The trend must therefore be reversed; otherwise it would grind to a halt. <heading>Lifestyles</heading><list><heading>Drive car-</heading>To workSchool RunFor leisure/social/domestic reasonsShopping</list>People are used to using car wherever they go.

Clark (2000)</quote><heading>How? </heading>Better provision of public transport -Government subsidies for public transport companies thus reducing user charges -Schemes such as the London Congestion Charge - money goes into public transport therefore further reducing charges Further penalising motorists through increased tax and petrol prices In cities - schemes such as the London congestion charge encourages people to use their cars less <heading>Government Policy</heading>Government policy should be used to discourage car use. Political boldness should be applied; politicians need to be less concerned about their political futures and more about the future of the country. <quote>'Economic signals such as licence fees, fuel tax, tax allowances and infrastructure charges such be extended and made to 'bite' on a gradual and incremental basis.' Ravetz (2000) pp 104-105</quote>By increasing costs to use the private car people would eventually feel inclined to use public transport. <heading>Problems</heading>Currently public transport provision is not good enough: Trains are unreliable and expensive Buses are stuck in congestion, obviously this issue relates to car use People feel less comfortable using pulic transport - elements of personal safety Public transport cannot take you 'to your door.' <heading>But the main hurdle is attitude</heading>Over the past 40 years - the private car has transformed the way we live. People are used to this. People can use their cars - so will. It is easier than public transport Education - people need to be educated about why they need to use public transport more Other than increasing public transport use, there are other ways of cutting pollution green fuels new technology but this does not deal with congestion - which is another major problem If the trend didn't reverse, congestion would get worse if predictions are correct. How else would this be combated - through an extensive road building programme? Previous road building - such as widening the M25, has proven that road building does not cut congestion; it encourages people to use the roads more, therefore increasing congestion. <heading>Conclusion</heading>A reversal of this trend would be very desirable. Whilst impossible to totally illiminate car use - a reversal in this trend would significantly cut congestion due to fewer cars on the road. It would also cut pollution, and could be actioned along with an increased use of new technology and greener fuels. <heading>Is a reversal of the trend possible? </heading>Yes, if the following is applied; we need to provide better public transport services we also need to better educate people we need to discourage people from using their cars - increase the costs such as congestion charging
