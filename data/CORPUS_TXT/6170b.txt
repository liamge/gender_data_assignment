<abstract><heading>Purpose</heading>The purpose of this report is to evaluate the usability of the current way-finding system for Armstrong Siddeley building and based on this evaluation prepare the prototype of the redesign. </abstract><heading>Overview</heading>The way-finding systems are designed in order to give people clear and appropriate directions in places they are unfamiliar with. The most important attribute of such system is its usability and satisfaction it gives to the user. It is crucial that the way can be found as quickly as possible. In case of our prototype the target time for locating the person / room does not exceed 2 minutes. The idea of introducing the way-finding system for Armstrong Siddeley building was to help the following people to find the way without help of reception (which might be closed): <list>First time visitors to the schoolVisiting academics arriving for meetings with staff Student from other schools attempting to locate tutorial roomsFiends/relatives of students</list>It appears that the current system is not usable and does not meet user requirements. <heading>Usability problems of current solution</heading>It appears that the current system is a very good example of a bad design therefore we are not going to concentrate on finding solutions to improve it but we will consider all the usability issues that were found to make redesign of the system more usable. <heading>Visibility problem </heading><list>Severity HighImpact User dissatisfaction </list>Probably the most important problem of current way-finding system concerns the visibility. At the first glance user has no idea what are the features of the system. What is more, the user might even not notice what the system is supposed to do ("ROOM / STAFF LOKATOR" in the left corner is not highlighted and is not eye catching at all). This system will be installed on the computer by the entrance to the building. As the first time visitor has no idea what this computer is for, there should be a short but easily noticeable note e.g. "LET ME HELP YOU FIND YOUR WAY" on the main page. <heading>Navigation problem </heading><list>Severity HighImpact Difficulty of navigation </list>One of the main problems of this system concerns navigation. In a well designed system the user is able to find adequate menus and links. In case of current way-finding system there are no menus and everything is put in one place, without any logical order. User gets confused and does not try to use the system. S/he goes to ask the reception instead. In the prototype we will focus on grouping links and putting them in some logical order. <heading>Style problem </heading><list>Severity HighImpact User dissatisfaction</list>The current way-finding system is found unstylish because of too much information on the main page. This information should be decomposed into sub pages. The instruction how to find a person is written at the beginning of the page while it should be presented e.g. as a list of steps to perform. The user will not remember the whole instruction at once; therefore he should be advised to take one step after another. <heading>Familiarity problem 1</heading><list>Severity HighImpact User confusion </list>Another very serious problem in current system concerns the way the map of the ground floor is presented (the rest floors would be probably designed in the same way). When we click on "Ground floor" link the map of selected floor is presented. Unfortunately there is no legend (the information "Teaching rooms are highlighted in blue on the map for each floor" was given on previous - main page) what can make user confused why some rooms are highlighted in blue. A smaller problem with the map is the lack of "Back" button - navigation problem. <heading>Familiarity problem 2</heading><list>Severity MediumImpact User confusion</list>One more problem I found important in the current way-finding system concerns the way the e-mail addresses are presented e.g. r.bali. Only part of the email with the person name is shown whereas the server domain is not visible. It might cause problems for potential students and their relatives as they would not know that the domain is coventry.ac.uk. The best and easiest way to fix it is just add the domain name to the email address e.g. r.bali@coventry.ac.uk. <heading>Task analysis</heading>The way-finding system is supposed to assist the user in locating appropriate rooms or staff members. I have asked potential users what tasks they would expect the system to perform. Basing on the most frequent answers I decided to create five main tasks (each of them will have a separate menu). Most of the tasks will contain different options to make searching more successful and flexible. For any search request the system should respond not only with the room/floor number or name of staff member but also should give the directions how to get there (display a map of the floor with desired room). <heading>Task 1 - Search for Person</heading>This feature will enable the user to find the right person. It will contain several options: Search by name - the search facility should allow for minor spelling mistakes due to high number of international students and lecturers. Search by subject - users do not always know what the name of the lecturer they are looking for is but they might know what subject he teaches. What is more the potential student will not look for particular lecturer because of his name but he might want to speak to a person who teaches some particular subject e.g. to discuss the module content and objectives. Search by role - again potential students or their parent might want to speak with e.g. Head of Department not because of his name but with regard to his role. Once the user finds the staff member he is looking for, he should be provided with information regarding not only room number and its location but also with working hours and the schedule of the person. <heading>Task 2 - Search for Room</heading>This feature will enable the user to locate the right room. Similarly to looking for person, it will also contain a few options: <list>Search by room numberSearch by room name (e.g. reception or laboratory)Search by module - this option might be useful if we are trying to locate where a lecture is taking place</list>The system should display a map of the floor with the searched room. <heading>Task 3 - How to submit a coursework? </heading>This feature will be used by student's friends or relatives who come to submit the student's coursework. The system will show the way to Academic Office (a map) and will also give information about the latest time allowed for submission. <heading>Task 4 - Maps</heading>This feature of the system will show the map of selected floor. It will be useful for potential students who are not searching for a particular room but only want to get familiar with the building. The legend for all maps will be also provided. <heading>Task 5 - Staff List</heading>The system will also enable to list names of all staff members. This approach might be useful in case the user does not remember the exact name but would recall it when he sees it written. This feature is very easy and low cost to implement and very handy for the users at the same time. The prototype that I build will comprise all above named features and can be further developed in order to increase user satisfaction. In a final system all the maps should be interactive - when the user moves the mouse over a room, information concerning this room should be displayed e.g. whose office it is etc. <heading>Prototype</heading>In the process of developing the prototype I based on task analysis performed in previous section as the most important attribute of the system is meeting user requirements. I have also considered and tried to avoid all usability problems described in section 3. The system will be compliant with usability heuristics by Benyon, Turner & Turner. There is menu on the left hand side displaying the system features. This solution makes the system easy to navigate. When a user clicks on any of the links, the relevant page will be displayed in the main window. "Home" button enables coming back to the main page. There is no need to place any "back" buttons as the system is very simple and does not have nested sub pages - to go back user always can click on either appropriate link or "Home" button. The main page of designed system is shown at Figure 1: <picture/>On the main page I have placed the "search" option. It is a general search which enables to search for any phrase within the way-finding system. "Search for person" page is shown at Figure 2: <picture/>"Search for room" page is shown at Figure 3: <picture/>"How to submit coursework? " page is shown at Figure 4: <picture/>"Maps" page is shown at Figure 5: <picture/>To choose the floor the user needs to click on the floor link. The map of the chosen floor will then be displayed (see Figure 6). The legend and floor links will still be available (so that the user does not have to memorize what the colour means etc.). In the future the user should also have option to print the map with the legend but this option will not be available at the first release as there is no printing device. <picture/>"Staff List" page is shown at Figure 7: <picture/>Figure 8 shows an example search result. We searched for a person, by name:"Hodder". <picture/>The system displays information concerning the searched person including his role, room number, phone number, email address and working hours. System also shows a map of the relevant floor with the route marked on it. It also gives the directions in text form (useful in case of any higher floors as it is impossible to show on the map e.g. "take a lift to 3 rd floor"). <heading>Summary</heading>The proposed prototype seems to meet all user requirements. It is simple and therefore easy to use. It does not contain any irrelevant information which would make it less visible. All main features of the system have their links on the left hand side menu which is available all the time. Proposed solution is compliant to the set of heuristics.
