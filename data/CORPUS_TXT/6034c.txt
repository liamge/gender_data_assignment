<abstract><heading>1. Executive summary</heading>ASDA and Tesco attract nearly 80 per cent of organic food customers, Safeway 13 and Waitrose 9. Nevertheless, the higher share of monthly expenditure on organic products was noted in the latter supermarket chain, and reached almost 10 percent when the average was just above 8. Waitrose organic customer tends to be older and better off than the average buyer of organic-labelled food across all of the identified spending categories. Such person lives in a larger than average household, is open to the media and, unless is the 'Heavy buyer', consumes reduced amounts of meat in favour of fish and vegetables. The core of Waitrose organic customers are heavy and medium buyers, who dedicate over 6 per cent of their monthly expenditure to organic purchases. Those two categories together account for nearly 90 per cent of the Waitrose's revenue from organic sales. The marketing campaign should be targeted at them. Most lighter organic buyers are probably buying organic products 'accidentally' rather than consciously, but represent the area of potential growth in frequency of purchase and the amount spent subject to the targeted marketing camping. The marketing campaign should emphasise the health, taste and well-being aspects of organic food consumption. It should also stress the environmental and animal welfare aspects of organic food production in order to reinforce the existing customers' positive perception of organic purchases. The campaign should also strengthen the link between the social image of the three consumer groups and the consumption of organic products, presenting the organic purchases as the 'eco-logical' choice. </abstract><heading>2. Introduction and background study</heading>The organic market in the UK has grown rapidly in recent years and is now one of the biggest in the word, with annual sales of around £ 1 billion, representing 1 per cent of the total food and drink market. Supermarkets sell 80% of all organic food consumed in the UK and 75% of all UK households bought at least one organic item in the last 12 months. <fnote>Organic Food: Understanding the consumer and increasing sales.

Wright, The Organic Consultancy, 2006,  URL  (viewed: 10/02/2006) </fnote>According to the study by Taylor Nelson/Sofres (TNS) The typical British organic consumer is an older person living in London or the south of England. Only 7% of organic buyers account for 57% of all the annual spending on organic products. These committed consumers spend c.a. £200 per year on organic food, while the average household expenditure is £22 per year. At the other end of the spectrum are almost 30% of organic buyers, who only bought one organic food item in the last 12 months (probably by mistake). <fnote>Wright S., Organic Britain, The Organic Consultancy, http: // URL  (viewed 10/02/2006). The article originally appeared in, Organic Life, June/July 2001. </fnote>The prospects for organic food in the UK seem to be promising. To make to most of this fact, it is crucial for those marketing organic food to better understand who the organic consumers are, what are their preferences and buying behaviour. <fnote>Ibid. </fnote>The following report is based on research by AC Consulting Ltd. (ACC), commissioned by the supermarket chain, Waitrose. The aim of the research is to define the profile of customers purchasing organic products at Waitrose, on the averaged background of major competitors, and provide practical advice for the design of the tailored marketing strategy. <heading>3. Methodology</heading>ACC analysed the profile of 82 organic consumers by means of the SPSS statistical package. Buyers were classified into three groups according to the share of their organic spending overall expenditure: <fnote>The classification of buyers into 'heavy', 'medium' and 'light' originates from the report: Organic Food: Understanding the consumer...op.cit., p. 8. </fnote><list>Light: 0-6%,Medium: 7-12%,Heavy: over 12%.</list>The three key research questions were: Which aspects of consumer profile are conducive to organic purchases? How does the profile of Waitrose organic customer differ from the typical organic consumer? How does the profile of organic consumer differ across the identified spending categories? The scope of the study did not allow for the extended comparison of all supermarkets across distinguished categories. Therefore, the general, averaged profile of an organic consumer was created. Against this background the key distinguishing features of Waitrose customers were identified, so that the unique, precisely targeted marketing strategy could be designed. <fnote>The filtering out of the non-organic buyers from the initial database allowed for the elimination of the Kwiksafe supermarket from the group of potential competitors, as not a single person bought an organic item there. </fnote><heading>4. Results</heading>The general results show that ASDA and Tesco attract nearly 80 per cent of organic food customers, Safeway 13 and Waitrose only 9 (Figure 3, appendix). Nevertheless, the higher share of monthly expenditure spent on organic products was noted in the latter, and reached almost 10 percent when the average was just above 8. Tables 1-4 (appendix) constitute basis of the following analysis. The identified segments, their share in overall organic Waitrose revenue and the number of consumers, that were used in the research are presented in figures1 and 2 respectively (see appendix). The findings for the Waitrose chain specifically, according to the distinguished categories, are the following: <heading>Heavy buyers</heading>Customers who dedicate more than 12 per cent of their monthly spending to organic food and account for 48 per cent of the Waitrose's income from organic sales. They are wealthier than the average organic consumer that falls in this category. Their monthly spending on the key food categories, such as meat, fish and vegetables are also larger. Their mean organic monthly expenditure equals almost £12 in comparison with the £9.4 on average. This consumers spend relatively less on the own-brand products. Heavy buyers tend to be older than the organic spender's population average and have a larger household, however the number of children (less than one) does not distinguish them significantly form the average. They also do not differ from the average for this category in terms of the weekly hours of the TV watched, but tend to listen to the radio 2 hours longer than the average 'heavy buyer' shopping at other supermarkets . They are car owners and likely to be vegetarian, what positively influences their organic food spending. 50 per cent of Waitrose 'Heavy spenders' are web surfers, however such consumers seem to spend less on organic food than those not using the internet. <heading>Medium buyers</heading>This category of consumers spends between 6-12 per cent of their monthly expenditure on organic food, and are second largest contributor to Waitrose's income from organic sales (41 per cent), but the same time the most numerous. More than 60 per cent of them are car owners. They are, just like Waitrose 'Heavy buyers' better off than the average for this category. Their monthly meat expenditure is below the average and so is the vegetable expenditure, however they seem to be spending over twice more on fish. The per cent of expenditure dedicated to organic food does not differ much form the average £9.27, but they tend to purchase less own-brand products. They are on average 7 years older than the standard organic consumer for this category, and although they live in larger households with more children. The hours spend weekly on TV watching and radio listening do not differ from the average. <heading>Light buyers</heading>The Waitrose light buyers's purchases account for 11 per cent of the client's income from organic sales, but at the same time are as numerous as the Heavy buyers. They dedicate less than 6 per cent of their monthly spending to organic foodstuffs, are on average £9,000 better off than the similar buyers in other supermarkets (see table). Their overall spending is higher than average, and this tendency is not sustained only in one expenditure category, namely 'meat'. In spite of their relatively high vegetable spending they are unlikely to be vegetarian. Their spending on organic food exceeds twofold the average expenditure in this category. They less eager to buy own brand products. They are also older than the average, but live in slightly smaller households with no kids. They watch TV, listen to the radio and surf the web more than their average counterparts. <heading>5. Marketing discussion</heading>The marketing strategy calibrated for Waitrose supermarket chain should be of a hybrid type, taking into account certain common features of organic customers shopping at this chain as well as the characteristics specific for the three distinguished types of spenders. <heading>Organic is a luxurious purchase</heading>The typical Waitrose organic customer is wealthier than the customers shopping at the competitor supermarkets. The most important feature of organic products that should be therefore emphasised is the luxurious character of purchase, that is not at all common yet. <heading>Organic is good for your health</heading>The higher average age and wealth of Waitrose customers, could also serve as an indicator for the strategy, that should emphasise the health-beneficial as well as the taste and well-being aspects of organic food consumption. <heading>Organic is good for your family</heading>Both heavy and medium buyers have larger than average families. The campaign should emphasise the diverse, positive aspects of organic food consumption for people in either age group, especially children and elderly people. Those two groups of top organic spenders seem to already comprise of conscious organic consumers and therefore their positive attitude could be reinforced by emphasising such aspects of the organic food production and consumption as food safety, care for the environment and the animal welfare. <heading>Organic for singles</heading>The group of light buyers is relatively small yet and therefore has potential for growth. As they life in small households with no children, their general food purchases will be limited in bulk, but can be of a high quality, given their average income. Therefore it is suggested, that the organic products in the campaign targeted at this group should be presented not only as a health beneficial, but also high quality, tasty and perfectly fitting their modern lifestyle. <heading>Organic-yes but not own brand</heading>As organic shoppers across all categories did show relatively lower interest in own-branded products, therefore it is important to inform customers that specifically at Waitrose they can purchase organic products from the renowned producers. The product should have its own unique identity and be linked with the area of origin. <heading>Organic meat-yes, but only for heavy buyers</heading>It is worth noting, that only heavy buyers spend more on each of the analysed products categories, namely meat, fish and vegetables. The remaining two tend to reduce their overall meat consumption in favour of fish and vegetables, what is especially evident in the 'light buyer's' spending patterns. This is particularly important as far as the visual aspects of the future marketing campaigns are concerned, as it indicates which products should be displayed in TV commercials or in promotional folders. <heading>Organic and the media</heading>Members of all of the distinguished groups use the media such as TV or radio more or at least as frequently as the average organic consumers. The heavy buyers tend to favour radio over TV and this fact could serve as an indicator for organic radio campaign. It is highly likely that the radio programmes informing about various aspects of organic food consumption would be well received by them. Therefore it is worth considering a sponsorship of such programs and building up positive relationships with the TV and radio reporters. <heading>Surfi'n'orgnic</heading>The light buyers could easily be reached by the Internet, as they form the most often web-surfing group. Hence the web site should be informative of attractive and interactive design, if this group is to be encouraged to increase their purchases. <heading>Pearson's correlation </heading>As an additional and final point it should be added, that for the whole investigated sample, the factors most strongly and positively correlated with the spending on organic foods were household size, annual income and customer's age. It should be therefore taken into account, that competitors also could target this particular characteristics. <heading>6. Conclusion</heading>Although this report does not offer a simple, quick-fix marketing formula for sales and revenue increase, the ACC research shows that the attention has to be paid to a wide range of factors if the successful marketing strategy is to be implemented. The conducted analysis revealed the distinguished profile of the Waitrose organic customer, who tends to be older and better off than the average buyer of organic-labelled food across all of the identified spending categories. Such person lives in a larger than average household, is open to the media and, unless is the heavy buyer, consumes reduced amounts of meat in favour of fish and vegetables. The tailored marketing campaign should therefore be stressing the health, environmental, taste and well-being aspects of organic food consumption. It should also strengthen the link between the social image of the three consumer groups and the consumption of organic products, presenting the organic purchases as the 'eco-logical' choice. <heading>7. Identified pitfalls of the dataset</heading>After the non organic consumers were filtered out, there were only 7 consumers left, who purchased organic foodstuffs in Waitrose. This number was too small to conduct reliable statistical inference. In spite of this fact, the analysis was carried out. Most of the data were expressed not in absolute terms, but in percentages, in order to 'masque' the limited number of observations.
