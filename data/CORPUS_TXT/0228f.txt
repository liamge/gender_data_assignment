<abstract><heading>Summary</heading>Smart homes are needed to allow elderly people to live in their own homes, on their own. This smart home system takes an intensive approach, which means that there will be a few high quality sensors read by a sophisticated software system capable of making all the decisions and actions on itself. The two main sensors used are infrared cameras and boundary microphones. The infrared cameras will produce black and white images based on heat. The boundary microphones will pick up sound and listen for a keyword to be spoken. These are not obtrusive because the cameras do not give a real image and humans never view the data. The processing unit will use the data to make judgements on whether action should be taken or not. The software will take up to a maximum of one and a half years to develop and cost £200 000. However if we sell to 10% of the available market then development costs 53p per unit. The total cost per unit is £3200.53 with a possible selling price of £5000. The development in software will help to retain a unique market position whilst limiting competitors' ability to imitate this product. </abstract><heading>1. Introduction</heading>According to the Census 1991 there are 12 million people over the age of 60 living in the UK. Elderly people require more and more assistance in their daily lives, as they get older. This needs the help of professional health workers and nursing homes. The number of people living in nursing homes will increase, as more people need the attention. There will be a lack of professional health workers and also the nursing homes' capacity will become limited. Nursing homes are also fairly expensive. To overcome these problems the idea of the smart homes is needed. A smart home will be able to detect problems with the elderly person in the home without the need of a professional health worker. The home would then be able to contact the correct services to help the elderly person. The elderly person would be able to live in the comfort of his or her own home whilst still receiving the care of a health centre for a one-off fixed price. Devices have been previously developed in the past to help with this situation. One attempt was the panic button. The elderly person would carry around a panic button with them at all times. If a problem occurred then the elderly person would the press the button and help would come soon. These did not work because they were too big and bulky, getting in the way of everyday life. Another attempt was to use web cams however these did not work because the elderly people felt that this was too obtrusive. Both these ideas were good but problems came when implementing them in to the real world. The smart home would have to be designed to work well in a variety of different situations, have a low cost and also take the feelings of the elderly person into account. There were two approaches to the design of the smart home: extensive and intensive. An extensive system would have a lot of sensors placed around the home. These sensors would give information to the processing unit where the situation of the elderly person would be determined. This would require a simple processing unit. An intensive system would have a few high quality sensors, which would give feedback to the processing unit. The processing unit would have to have a sophisticated artificial intelligence system to process the simple data and give accurate results. After much deliberation it was decided to use an intensive system. This was because an extensive system was more susceptible to false alarms, would cost a lot for sensors and would also cost a lot to install. The failure of sensors would mean that sensors would have to be replaced regularly, causing more expense. An intensive system would have fewer sensors, less installation costs, and less sensors to fail. However it did have its disadvantages because a lot of money would have to go into development of the software. But once development was finished this cost would be divided across every single smart home unit sold. <heading>2. Basic Design</heading>This is the overview of the smart home system. <figure/>The two basic types of sensors to be used were infrared cameras and microphones. The infrared camera would not be seen as obtrusive because they only gave black and white images based on heat. <picture/>These images would only be seen by the processing unit and not by any humans. The microphones would pick up the sound in the room. When a keyword was spoken it would be sent to the processing unit and action would be taken. These ideas are similar to previous designs, of web cams and panic buttons, however the negative aspects have been removed. They would be positioned correctly so that only one sensor is needed. One of each sensor would be placed in each room and the hallway. <picture/>The software would be divided into three sections, the analysis module, the decision module and the action module. The sensors would be read frequently and handled in the processing unit. The processing unit would process the input data using the first software module. The analysis module will convert the image and sound data to a more appropriate form. If the image of the elderly person lying down in bed was sent to the first software module, it will tell the decision part of the module, "The elderly person is lying down in bed." This way the decision part of the software will know what the situation is with the elderly person without having to process all the data again. <figure/>The decision module will then decide on whether action should be taken based on the input from the analysis module. This module will produce suitable values, based on the scale of danger, from the input data and send these to the action software module. The decision module would have to have a good artificial intelligence system to decide whether accident has taken place or the elderly person is just carrying out a routine habit. If an accident has taken place then an appropriate value will be sent in the correct category. The action software module will take values from the decision software module and take the correct action. If there was a fire in the house then this module will receive a high value in the heat section and so call for the fire brigade. This software module would have different levels of action. If there were a low danger, for example if the cooker were left on, then the action module would send a message to a call centre. The call centre would then call the house to make sure everything is okay. The two types of output would speakers and a digital phone line. If the elderly person had fallen over then they would need confirmation that help is on the way. The system could give the message, "Help is on its way," through the speakers. The speakers would be flat panel speakers so that they are less obtrusive. To contact the emergency services the system would need some form of communication. This would be through the digital phone line. The whole system would be connected together by firewire. This is because firewire is cheap and reliable. There are many hubs and devices that support firewire and it can also carry power sufficient for the purpose of this system. The central processing unit would be an IBM Thinkpad R31. This is because it has high specification for a low price. It also has the bonuses that it has a built in sound card, for audio input and output, and USB connectivity for easy connection to the modem and phone lines. <heading>3. Detailed Design - Decision Software Module</heading>The decision software module would be responsible for the calling of action and so has to be designed well. It must be reliable and safe whilst still being accurate and fast. For this reason it must employ some guidelines. The software should be capable of making decisions on its own so that it speeds up response times. It would waste a lot of time if it had to go from computer to human and back to computer; the time wasted in extreme cases could cause loss of life. The data received from the analysis module would need to be converted to a form that was easier for the computer to process and understand, i.e. converting form a human language to a communication suitable for the computer. The conversion should comply with the scale of danger. The scale of danger is a method designed to reduce the number of false alarms. If there is low danger in one area then no action is taken, or a warning is sent. If there is a high danger in one area then action is taken. If there is a low danger in many areas then action is also taken. There is an example of this in the appendix. To meet these requirements a high level artificial intelligence system is needed. The artificial intelligence of the system must be adept in pattern recognition. The software should be able to distinguish between habit and accident. The emergency services should not be called out if the elderly person takes a nap on the couch. The result of the pattern recognition is that there will be a decrease in false alarms. For the purpose of pattern recognition the system should also skilful in pattern storage and pattern matching. These habits must be stored away and remembered and compared with the current situation at any time. When a hazard is found, a value, based on the scale of danger, should be given to the action software module. Based on this number the correct action will be taken. The software will also have cases programmed into it. For example, the case when the elderly person is lying on the floor would send a trigger to the action module; or if the elderly person is lying in bed for over twenty hours then action should be taken. This would help to deal with all situations. To best demonstrate the process of the system an example should be given. An elderly person takes a nap everyday from 4pm to 6pm everyday on the couch. The image is sent through to the analysis module, which sends the following data to the decision module: Person is lying down on couch, in living room. The decision module will prepare to send a high danger signal because the person is in a lying down position. This could mean that they have fallen over. But it then checks the location of the person, which is the couch, and the time, which is 4.30pm. It then checks for this in its habits section. It will find a match because the person always takes this nap. So the signal is not sent and action is not taken. In this case it would have been wrong for the emergency services to be called. The following day the elderly person falls over in the kitchen shouting the keyword help. The time is 5pm and the cooker is on. The decision module receives the message: Person is lying down on floor, in kitchen, keyword spoken. The system will check for a habit match, not find one, and send the following values based on the scale of danger. There would be a low value of two in the heat section due to the cooker being on. There would be a high value of seven in the elderly persons health section due to the elderly person lying down on the floor. There would be a high value of nine in the sound section due to the keyword being spoken (these number are just examples of figures that could be given). These three values would be sent to the action section where they are matched up against the correct action. In this particular case a health worker would be sent for and the speakers would output the message, "Help is on its way." <heading>4. Cost</heading>The cost can be broken down into two cost sections. The fixed development costs and the cost per unit. The fixed development costs are a one off payment and the cost can be divided across all the units sold. The cost per unit is the cost applicable to every unit sold. The fixed cost for the development of the analysis software module is £80 000. The fixed cost for the development of the decision software module is £90 000. The fixed cost for the development of the action software module is £20 000. The total cost for the hardware (including installation + audio analysis software) is £3000 per unit. These seem like high figures but since we are investing in software there are hidden advantages. Once software is finished we do not have to spend anymore on it again. The cost is divided across the total units sold and also it is more difficult for competitors to copy. Distribution of software is easy and straightforward. As stated before there are 12 million people, over the age of 60, living in the UK. It is estimated that about 30% of that market will be able to afford a smart home with this design. If we aim to take 10% of this market in three years then our final product cost can be calculated. 10% of the potential market adds to 360 000 people. The development costs divided across these 360 000 people totals to 53p per unit for all three sections of software together. The total cost of the system is £3000.53. A possible selling price for the unit is £5000 pounds. This is price is affordable since this covers only six months in a nursing home. It also allows the development costs to be returned quickly. There would be the standard charge of paying for the digital phone lines, which would be about £30 per month. However this would be paid to the normal phone supplier and not for the smart home system cost. The only other costing is time. Development is estimated to take about 32 weeks for the analysis module, 30 weeks for the decision module and 8 weeks for the action software module. These module developments can continue simultaneously allowing development to take about 35 weeks. This includes time for testing the modules together. However in a worst case scenario the modules would have to be done one after the other taking a maximum of 80 weeks, which is about one and half years. For a more detailed costing refer to appendix. All costs are for a standard apartment with one bedroom. <heading>5. Conclusion</heading>The smart home idea specified in this report has a design suitable for its purposes of allowing elderly people to live on their own, in their own homes. It uses an intensive, non-obtrusive approach to caring for the elderly person by using infrared cameras and boundary microphones for sensors. It is still fast and reliable due to the thoroughly developed software system. The software is divided into three sections, the analysis module, the decision module and the action module. The development for this software may take up to one and half years but the software design helps the system to retain its market position while also stopping competitors from imitating it. The price is also reasonable at £5000 seeing as many people will pay more than this to live in the nursing homes. The only extra cost on this is the charge for the lines made by the elderly person's own telephone company.
