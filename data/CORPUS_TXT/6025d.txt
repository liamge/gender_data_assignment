<heading>Exercise AEstimation of the gross energy content of foods using the bomb calorimeter</heading><heading>Abstract</heading>The bomb calorimeter is use to estimate the gross energy content of digestive biscuit. The estimated value for the gross energy content is than compared with the nutritional value given on the package of biscuit. <heading>Introduction</heading>The enthalpy change (â–³H) during a chemical reaction depends only upon the initial state of reactants and final state of product. (Fig.1) <figure/> FORMULA As the states of initial reactants and final products are the only important factor of a chemical reaction, the site of reaction does not affect the energy change of the reaction. Therefore, the enthalpy change for the enzymatic oxidation of glucose with human body is the same as when glucose oxidized in the air. The oxidation of glucose is exothermic; the enthalpy of product is relatively low than that for the reactants. (Fig.2) Heat is liberated in an exothermic reaction. <figure/>In a laboratory, the amounts of energy contained in food samples are determined with a bomb calorimeter  (fig.3.) The whole apparatus is sunk in a water bath of known volume and temperature. The food is ignited electrically and burns explosively in the excess of oxygen supply. The heat liberated during combustion, which known as gross energy value, is represented by the temperature rise after completed combustion. The data can be used to calculate the energy liberated in joules, which then being converted to calories, the nutritional literature energy value. It is marked that the conditions for the experimental measurement of gross energy is differ to a small extent form those defined by physical chemist for the determination of enthalpy of combustion. <figure/><heading>Method</heading>Details of method using the adiabatic bomb calorimeter are listed in the schedule. <heading>Results</heading>The adiabatic bomb calorimeter is calibrated using benzoic acid, the standard gross energy of benzoic acid= 26.452KJ/g <heading>Benzoic acid standard</heading> FORMULA   FORMULA  which is then converted to Kcal per degree  FORMULA  <heading>Food sample (Digestive biscuit)</heading> FORMULA  Energy content of Biscuit  FORMULA  Energy content of one Biscuit = Energy content of Biscuit* weight of one Biscuit  FORMULA  <heading>Discussion</heading>According to the nutritional value table shown on the packet of digestive biscuit, the calorie given per biscuit is 73 Kcal. This differ form the estimated value in experiment by ( 78.8- 73.0)= 5.8 Kcal. The possibilities for the differences are: Although dessicator was presented in the container for keeping the biscuit, the biscuit have been exposed to open air during the preparation time, absorption of moisture may increase the estimate gross energy value due to the high heat capacity of water. Due to the fact that human body doesn't not absorb nutrients as much as the actual amount present in the food, food company tend to give the estimate absorbable amount of nutrients on the package. <heading>Reference</heading>Mary.E.Barasi, Human nutrition, a health perspective (1997) Chemical Energetics Definitions, Teachmetuition,  URL  (5/03/04)* Calorimetry, University of Florida, PJ Brucat  URL )* <heading>Exercise BAssessment of food intake, nutrient composition and energy balance. </heading><heading>Abstract</heading>Assess of food intake and activity was taken over a five-day period in this studies. Amount of nutrients uptake was estimated using databases, which was then compared with the energy expenditure. <heading>Introduction</heading>Most people maintain their body weight within very narrow limits. However, weight may change in case of an energy imbalance and it is likely to occur gradually and over long period of time. Energy uptake is regulated by a number of different factors, including physiological, psychological, social and environmental factors; all of those interact in a complex way and thus it is difficult to control. Energy output refers to energy needed to maintain physiological and biochemical activities (as basal metabolic rate) and also the physical activities, which can be written as the equation as below. (Fig.1) <figure/>However, it is not necessarily to maintain this equilibrium in a day-to-day basis, human body has the ability to overcome this problem. Surplus energy are stored as fat in the adipose tissue, which can be broken down to provide when it is needed. The actual energy balance equation can be written as below. (Fig.2) <figure/><heading>Results</heading><table/><table/><table/><table/><table/><table/><table/>The initial BMI of the person study was 18.9, which is in the category of underweight. During the five-day study period, the total energy expenditure exceeds the total energy intake. Energy has been drawn form the fat in adipose tissue to target organ in which energy is needed. <heading>Discussion</heading>Due to the fact that the person study is under the underweight category, it is essential for her to maintain a balanced diet to avoid excess weight loss. Although the person study has gained 0.5 kg during the five-day period, it can be refer as negligible. Possibilities for this error are: inaccurate measurement of weight due to the weight of clothing. On the other hand, although human body has the ability to store energy as fat as an energy back up, it is still very important to maintain a balanced diet overall. Dietary excesses are contribute to obesity, heart disease, bowel disease, etc. in contrast, dietary deficiencies are contribute to starvation, marasmus, kwashiorkor, etc. it is very important to maintain a suitable uptake of vitamins and minerals in daily basis, as the human body has a uptake limit of vitamins and minerals. The excess intake of vitamins and mineral will just go though the alimentary canal and eject with faeces. Sudden and large amount of vitamin/ mineral intake will cause vitamin/ mineral toxicities. People suffer form very serious disease in the deficiency of vitamins and mineral, for example: scurvy (deficiency of vitamin C), anemia (deficiency of vitamin A).
