<heading>Section 1</heading>Circa 2000 BC the Babylonians developed a formula for solving the quadratic polynomial equation. Since that time, mathematical history is littered with successful and failed attempts to solve poly-nomials of higher degrees. In the four thousand years since the Babylonians solved the quadratic, the cubic and quartic were solved towards the end of the Dark Ages and the Renaissance respec-tively and there were numerous researches into polynomials. Then Abel and Galois independently proved the unsolvability of the quintic by radicals, early in the nineteenth century. Solving the quadratic equation is something we learn early in secondary school and is instantly recognizable to the mathematician and non-mathematician alike. We learn to solve the equation ax 2 + bx + c by the following formula. Example 1.1  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA • This may seem inane but once the polynomials grow in degree, the question of the existence of solutions by radicals becomes more interesting and important. One of the main themes of this essay is the solution by radical of polynomials, leading to: Theorem 6.17 If n ≥ 5 then the general polynomial of degree n is not soluble by radicals. (The theorem is quoted from page 147, I.N Stewart's Galois Theory, Chapman and Hall/CRC (1973)). To prove this we need to become familiar with some Galois theory.) We will also investigate a method of solving the quintic equation not involving radicals. <heading>Section 2</heading>The Eisenstein irreducibility criterion, below, gives a situation where a polynomial f is irreducible i.e it is not a product of two polynomials of lesser degree. To get there we need the following: Definition 2.1 For a quotient field F,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  are called the content and primitive of  FORMULA  Theorem 2.2 Let U be a unique factorization domain with quotient field F and let nonzero  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  unique. Also, the coefficients of  FORMULA  belong to U and have no non-trivial common factors in U, a primitive element. Proof: The coefficients of a(x) are fractions of elements of U with a common denominator from the definition of a field of quotients. Then  FORMULA  and for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . From Algebra II, let b be a highest common factor so that  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . For uniqueness we have  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  and since  FORMULA  we see  FORMULA  for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA . U is a unique factorization domain so r, s have no non-trivial common factor. If s is not a unit of U then it has an irreducible factor p. We know p divides the coefficient of  FORMULA  and p is prime since U is a unique factorization domain. This gives rise to a contradiction since r and s are relatively prime and p divides s so it does not divide r. Then p must divide the coefficients of  FORMULA  giving the contradiction, so  FORMULA  is a unit. Then  FORMULA  is a unit and  FORMULA .• The next theorem follows easily. Theorem 2.3 Let U be a unique factorization domain with quotient field F with  FORMULA . Suppose  FORMULA  for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  with the degrees  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  equal. Proof: We know a(x) =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA . The product of primitive polynomials is again primitive (Page 396, A First Course In Abstract Algebra, Fraleigh, Addisn-Wesley (2003)) and by the uniqueness proved in Theorem 2.2,  FORMULA  for some unit  FORMULA . Take a c to be a highest common factor of the coefficients of a(x), so  FORMULA . Then we can take  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . • Now to prove Eisenstein's irreducibility criterion. Theorem 2.4 Let U be a unique factorization domain with quotient field F. Let f(x) be a non-constant polynomial with coefficients in U. Suppose there exists an irreducible  FORMULA  such that a) p does not divide the leading coefficient b) p divides all other coefficients c) p2 does not divide the constant term. Then f(x) is irreducible over F[x]. Proof: Take f(x) a polynomial of degree n, with leading coefficient  FORMULA .By Theorem 2.3, we only have to consider factorizations with coefficients in U. Let f(x) =  FORMULA  with the leading coefficients of g(x), bk, and h(x), cl, nonzero. We have k +l = n, a0 = b0c 0 and a n = bkc l.We know that p divides all but the leading coefficient of f(x) so without loss of generality, p divides b0 and not c 0 since p 2 does not divide a0. Let i be the smallest positive integer such that p divides b i. Then we see ai =  FORMULA  and p divides bj for j < i. We know p is prime and does not divide bi, c 0 so does not divide bic meaning it does not divide ai. So i = n and since we know n = k + l and i < k we have k = n and l = 0. This means that we can only factorize in the form f(x) = hg(x) for  FORMULA  and by Theorem 2.2, there is no proper factorization of f(x) in F[x]. • (Page 54, Chatters and Hajarnavis, An Introductory Course In Commutative Algebra, Oxford (1998)) This next basic example shows how the Eisenstein irreducbilty criterion may be used. Example  FORMULA . This is irreducible since p = 11 does not divide 1 and p2 = 121 does not divide 22 although p divides all other coefficients. One of the most important ideas in Galois theory is the field extension. To quote page 29, I.N Stewart's Galois Theory, Chapman and Hall/CRC (1973): <quote>"From this viewpoint the central object of study ceases to be a polynomial, and becomes instead a 'field extension' related to a polynomial. Every polynomial f over a field K defines another field L containing K" </quote>But what is a field extension? Definition 2.6 Let M be a field. A extension of M is a field N, containing M, such that the inclusion  FORMULA  is a field homomorphism. We say that N is an extension of M, N : M. We also need to consider simple extensions, Definition 2.7 M(α) is the field obtained from M by adjoining α, FORMULA . If N is an extension of M then it is a simple extension if N = M(α) for some  FORMULA . We can classify simple extensions M(α) : M into distinct classes according to the type of element adjoined to M. Definition 2.8 If M(α) : M is a simple extension, then α is an algebraic element of M if f(α) = 0 where f(x)  FORMULA  is some non-zero polynomial. Then M(α) : M is a simple algebraic extension. Otherwise, α is a transcendental element and M(α) : M is a simple transcendental extension. Definition 2.9 A polynomial is monic over M if the leading coefficient an = 1. The minimum polynomial is the polynomial of least degree which meets the requirement of Definition 2.9. Definition 2.10 For an element α, algebraic over M, the minimum polynomial over M is the unique monic polynomial of least degree such that m(α) = 0. Theorem 2.11 Let m be an irreducible monic polynomial over M. Then there exists M(α) : M such that m(x) is the minimum polynomial of α over M. The proof is not given here since it is not required for later proofs, but is worth looking at. (INS) The next theorem gives us an idea when the minimum polynomial of a field M is irreducible. The proof is simple but quite long so we only give an outline. Theorem 2.12 Let M be a field. If α is an algebraic element over M then the minimum polynomial m of α is irreducible over M. Further, it divides every polynomial for which p(α) = 0. Outline of Proof: Assuming that m of α over M is reducible we have m = ab with a and b monic of degree  FORMULA . Since m(α) = a(α)b(α) = 0 we see that there is a contradiction so m is irreducible. Take p over M with p(α) = 0. Then there exist q and r over M such that p = mq + r for  FORMULA . With p(α) = m(α)q(α) + r(α) = 0, we see that we must have r = 0 so m divides p. • Theorem 2.13 Any element of M(α), where M(α) : M is a simple extension, has a unique expression as a polynomial in α of degree less than that of the minimum polynomial of α over M. Proof: Let m(x) be the minimum polynomial of α over M. The elements of M(α) can be expressed as  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  and f, g are elements of M[t] the field of rational expressions. We can see that m does not divide g and m and g are coprime since m is irreducible (a minimum polynomial is irreducible for an algebraic element). So ag + bm = 1. Then  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  = 1. So  FORMULA  Let d =  FORMULA  = FORMULA  and d(α) = r(α). The degree of r is less than that of d. For uniqueness we let f(α) = g(α) with degrees less than that of m. With h =  FORMULA  we have h(α) =  FORMULA  = 0. We have the degree of h less than that of m and h is unique by the definition of m. • These results explores the relationship between extensions and isomorphisms. Theorem 2.14 If we have two simple extensions M(α) : M and M(β) : M, with α, β the zeros of the same minimum polynomial, the extensions are isomorphic and the isomorphism of M(α) and M(β) maps α to β. Proof: Every element of M(α) can be expressed uniquely as a polynomial x = xo + x\α + xnαn with degree less than that of the minimum polynomial m. Clearly  FORMULA , defined by  FORMULA , is bijective.  FORMULA = FORMULA  = FORMULA  = FORMULA  = FORMULA  Let x = a(α), y = b(α),xy = c(α) with a, b, c polynomials over M with degree less than that of m. We have 0 = xy - xy = a(α)b(α) - c(α) and there exists p such that ab = mp + c by INS. c is the remainder on dividing ab by m. Then,  FORMULA  So ψ is an isomorphism, the extensions are isomorphic since ψ is the identity on M and φ(α) = β. • Definition 2.15 The degree of a field extension N : M is the dimension of N considered as a vector space over M. It is written as [N : M] This theorem is also known as the tower law and is always useful when dealing with field extensions. Theorem 2.16 If M, N, P are fields with  FORMULA  then [P : M] = [P : N][N : M]. Proof: Let [P : N] = n and [N : M] = m. If  FORMULA  is a basis for P over N there exist  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . With  FORMULA  we have  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and a basis  FORMULA  for N over M. So  FORMULA  span P over M. Let  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and let  FORMULA . We know that the xi are linearly independent over N so δi = 0 for  FORMULA . We know that the yj are linearly independent over M so λj = 0 for i and j so  FORMULA  is a linearly independent set over M. Then the elements of this set form a basis of P over M so [P : M] = [P : N][N : M] if the RHS is finite. Suppose the LHS is finite. A basis for P over M spans P over N. So  FORMULA . N is a linear subspace of P so  FORMULA . • This next theorem states the relationship between the degree of a minimum polynomial over a field and the field extension. This theorem is very useful when we are trying to decide on the properties of constructible points. Theorem 2.17 If M(α) : M is a simple algebraic extension then [M(α) : M] = deg(m) where m is the minimum polynomial over M. Proof: By Theorem 2.13 we know  FORMULA  are linearly independent and span M(α) over M when deg(m) = n. So the form a basis of M(α) over M and [M(α) : M] = n. • The definition of a finite basis and the concluding theorem of this section are important in later section when dealing with extensions that are finite. Definition 2.18 A finite field extension is an extension with finite degree n. This theorem links an algebraic simple extension with a finite one. Theorem 2.19 If N is algebraic over M and there exist a finite number of elements in N such that  FORMULA  iff N : M is finite. Proof: Suppose N : M is finite. If  FORMULA  then  FORMULA  so α is algebraic and N : M is algebraic. If  FORMULA  is a basis for N over M then  FORMULA  so that L is finitely generated over K. Let M0 = M and  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . Note that  FORMULA  is algebraic over  FORMULA  so  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA . • <heading>Section 3</heading>Extensions can be applied to geometrical problems as well as the classification of numbers. For example, the impossibility of doubling a cube and the trisection of an angle. First we need to know what a constructible point is. Let  FORMULA  be a set of points in R 2. Draw a line through any two points of  FORMULA . Draw a circle with centre at a point in  FORMULA  and with radius equal to the distance to another point in  FORMULA . The point of intersection of circles or lines drawn in this way, is said to be constructible in one step. A point p is constructible if a finite sequence of points in R 2,  FORMULA , exists such that pi is constructible in one step from  FORMULA . Theorem 3.1 Let  FORMULA  be the subfield of R generated by the coordinates of points in  FORMULA . Say  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  is obtained by adjoining  FORMULA  to  FORMULA . Then αi and βi are zeroes of quadratic polynomials in  FORMULA .(A Course in Galois Theory, DJH Garling,CUP (1986)). Theorem 3.2 If we have a point p = (αi, βi) that is constructible from  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  is a subfield of R generated by the coordinates of  FORMULA  then  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  are powers of 2. Proof: From 3.1 and 2.16 we have  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . So  FORMULA  So  FORMULA . Obviously, by induction,  FORMULA  and since  FORMULA  we see that  FORMULA  is a power of 2 and similarly for β. • Now for some impossibility proofs. A problem that was a major headache for the Greeks was how to trisect an angle of  FORMULA . We now prove the impossibility of this. Theorem 3.3 The angle  FORMULA  cannot be trisected. Proof: First note that  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  . We realise that trisecting this particular angle depends on constructing the point  FORMULA . Letting  FORMULA  we see that  FORMULA . By 2.4 we see that  FORMULA  is irreducible over Q[x]. Then [Q(α) : Q]. So the point α is not constructible. • You may have heard of the Greek puzzle where Athena's wrath was revealed when her instructions for doubling the cube were not followed correctly. Theorem 3.4 Doubling the cube is impossible. Proof: Let us have the unit cube. We are looking to construct a cube with volume 2, and hence we must construct  FORMULA . This is a zero of  FORMULA  which is irreducible over  FORMULA  by 2.3. So  FORMULA • This is the last of our impossibility proofs, but there are many others including the construction of n-gons. Theorem 3.5 We cannot square the circle. Proof: Let the circle we are attempting to square have radius 1 and hence an area π. We would need to construct a square with side  FORMULA . However, we know that this is transcendental. • We now look at the application of number theory to the construction of polygons. This theorem concerns Fermat primes, but on the same subject you may have heard of Gauss' 17-gon. Definition 3.6 A Fermat prime is a prime  FORMULA . As stated in IN Stewart's Galois Theory, Chapman and Hall (1973) the only known Fermat primes are  FORMULA . We do not prove the next theorem but it is interesting to consider. Theorem 3.7 Suppose that the regular p-gon is constructible where p is prime. Then p is a Fermat prime or p = 2. <heading>Section 4</heading>To those unfamiliar with Galois theory, the ideas in the last section do not seem to be building towards any specific goal. However, we are can now begin to explore the Galois group and some other ideas. Definition 4.1 Let K a subfield of M and φ an automophism of M. If  FORMULA  then φ is a K-automorphism of M. Theorem 4.2 The set of K-automorphisms forms a group for an extension M : K. Proof: Let φ and ψ be K-automorphisms then, φψ(k) = φ(k) = k so φψ is clearly an automorphism which fixes k. Let i be the identity map, which is a K-automorphism by definition. Clearly,  FORMULA  is an automorphism of M,  FORMULA  so that ψ-l is a K-automorphism. If σ is another K-automorphism, we see that since composition of maps is associative we can conclude the set of K-automorphims of M is a group. • Definition 4.3 The group of all K-automophisms of M is known as the Galois group of the extension M : K and is denoted Γ(M : K). We can find Galois groups and K-automorphisms by a simple exploration of the elements adjoined to the extension. Example 4.4 The Q-automorphisms of the extension  FORMULA  are simple to find. Let α be a Q-automorphism of  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA . Then s 2 =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  = 3. Hence s =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA . We have  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Now we see that  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Then α- is a Q-automorphism and so is  FORMULA  since it is the identity map. So the Galois group  FORMULA  is cyclic of order 2. • Let us explore the set  FORMULA  of all elements in N for N : M such that  FORMULA  for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  where L is a subgroup of Γ(N : M). Lemma 4.5 If L is a subgroup of Γ(N : M) then  FORMULA  is a subfield of N containing M. Outline of Proof: Take the M-automorphism  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . This gives  FORMULA . We also have  FORMULA . Similarly for the other field operations. So  FORMULA  is a subfield of N. We have  FORMULA  so  FORMULA . • Definition 4.6  FORMULA  is known as the fixed field of L. Let us also consider a field P such that  FORMULA  for N : M. Let P be known as an intermediate field and  FORMULA .  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . If  FORMULA  then  FORMULA . From the above we see  FORMULA  then  FORMULA . We can easily see that with P an intermediate field and L a subgroup of the Galois group then  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . The following mathematics seem to lead in the right direction since they involve the factorization and zeroes of polynomials over fields and extensions. We will now define splitting fields, normal and separable extensions and state and prove some results that will be of use later. Definition 4.7 Let M be a field and  FORMULA . If f can be expressed as  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  then f splits over M. Definition 4.8 The field Σ is a splitting field for the polynomial f over the field K if  FORMULA  and 1. f splits over Σ 2. If  FORMULA  and f splits over Σ' then Σ' = Σ. (Definition from DJH Garling's A Course in Galois Theory, Cambridge University Press (1986)) Here we give an example of a splitting field, we see a field with Example 4.9 Let  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  over Q. Inside C f splits into the linear factors  FORMULA  so the splitting field in C is  FORMULA . • The next two theorems explore the relationships between splitting fields under maps, specifically uniqueness up to isomorphism. Theorem 4.10 Let  FORMULA  be an isomorphism. Let f be a polynomial over M and Σ the splitting field for f over M. Let φ(f) split over N, an extension of M'. There is a monomorphism  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . (Page 79, I.N Stewart's Galois Theory, Chapman and Hall/CRC (1973)) This leads to, Theorem 4.11 Let  FORMULA  be an isomorphism. Let f be a polynomial over M and Σ the splitting field for f over M. Let Σ' be a splitting field for φ(f) over M'. There is an isomorphism  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . Proof: By 4.10 there exists a monomorphism  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . We see ψ(Σ) is a splitting field for φ(f) over M'. Σ' is also a splitting field for φ(f) over M' so ψ(Σ) = Σ' so ψ is surjective hence an isomorphism. • The normal extension has specific criteria for which polynomials split. Definition 4.12 N is said to be a normal extension of M if each polynomial  FORMULA  splits in N if it has at least one zero in N. We now give an example of a non-normal extension. Example 4.13 Q(α) : Q is a normal extension when α is the real seventh root of 5. This is because while  FORMULA  has a zero in Q(α) but it can't split in Q(α) or this would lead to the conclusion that there are seven real seventh roots of 5. • This theorem explores a relationship between normal extensions and splitting fields. Theorem 4.14 Σ : M is finite and normal iff Σ is a splitting field for some polynomial f over M. Proof: Let  FORMULA . By Theorem 2.10 and Theorem 2.15 we can see that  FORMULA  for certain αi. Let  FORMULA , where mi is the minimum polynomial of αi. We see that pΣ splits over Σ since each mi is irreducible over M with a zero n Σ. Hence Σ is a splitting field. Conversely, let Σ be a splitting field for some polynomial p over M. The extension Σ : M is then seen to be finite. Let m be an irreducible polynomial over M with a zero in Σ, Let Σ' be a splitting field for m p over M. Let µ1, µ2 be zeros of m in Σ'. For i = 1,2 we have  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  Theorem 2.16 gives  FORMULA . Then Σ(µi) is a splitting field for p over M(µi) and Theorem 2.1 gives M(µ1) = M(µ2) so by Theorem 3.11 we have an isomorphism between the extensions Σ(µ1) : M(µ1) and Σ(µ2) : M(µ2). So  FORMULA . If  FORMULA  then  FORMULA  so that  FORMULA  and Σ : M is normal. • Next, we must define separability, monomorphisms, automorphisms and normal closures. Monomorphisms can be used to build up K-automorphisms which enables us to calculate the order of the Galois group of a finite normal extension. A normal closure is an extension of an algebraic extension satisfying the condition that the new extension is normal. It allows the recovery of normality and an avoidance of the difficulties caused by a non-normal extension. Definition 4.15 An irreducible polynomial f of degree n over a field M is separable over M if it has n distinct roots in a splitting field. Definition 4.16 If an irreducible polynomial f over a field M is not separable over M then it is inseparable. Definition 4.17 An extension N:M is seperable if every  FORMULA  is seperable. The following gives an example of a separable polynomial. Example 4.18 The polynomial x3 + 5 is seperable over Z7. In C, f splits into linear factors f(x) = (x + α)(x + β)(x + γ) where α, β and γ are the distinct cube roots of -5. • This quick proof is useful in later sections. Theorem 4.19 If M is a field such that char(M) = 0 then every irreducible polynomial is separable over K. If  FORMULA , a polynomial over M is inseparable iff  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . Proof: Assume that an irreducible polynomial m over M is inseparable iff m and Dm have a common factor of degree greater than one (This theorem is simple to prove but a proof is on page 86. I.N Stewart's Galois Theory, Chapman and Hall/CRC (1973)). Then Dm = 0 since m is irreducible and deg(Dm) < deg(m). Then for  FORMULA  this implies nan = 0 and if char(M) = 0 we have an = 0. If  FORMULA  we have an = 0 if n = cp. Let ki = aip and m is inseparable for  FORMULA . • Definition 4.20 A K-monomorphism is a field monomorphism  FORMULA  such that ψ(k) = k for all  FORMULA  where K is a subfield of M and N. Definition 4.21 If N : M is an extension and P : M is normal then P : N is a normal closure for N : M. If  FORMULA  is a tower and O : N is normal then O = M. <heading>Section 5</heading>Now for the fundamental theorem of Galois theory. This is a rather beautiful correspondence between the set of automorphisms, the Galois groups, and the field extension. The full statement of the theorem is long and complicated so we settle for an informal statement which will be easier to follow. Much depends on our earlier discussion of intermediate fields and fixed fields. Theorem 5.1 Let us say we have a finite extension that is both separable and normal having degree n and Galois group G. Also, let us have a set  FORMULA  of intermediate fields,  FORMULA  of all subgroups of G with maps from one to the other. Then the Galois group G has order n since we can show that in this case we have  FORMULA ,  FORMULA , and the maps between  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  are mutual inverses with a bijection between the sets which follows from the first part. Given an intermediate field P we have  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . The first equality is obvious since N : P is seperable and normal, so the other follows. We have  FORMULA  a normal subgroup of G iff P is a normal extension of M. We also have an isomorphism between Γ(P : M) and  FORMULA  given P a normal extension of M. This is given by the standard application of group theory that we are familiar with to the Galois group of P : M. The full correct statement and proof are shown in I.N Stewart's Galois Theory, Chapman and Hall/CRC (1973), I.N Herstein's Topics in Algebra, Wiley (1975) and D.J.H Garling's. A Course In Galois Therory, Cambridge (1986) although it is stated and proved differently in the three books. This statement is easier to understand although examining all three will lead to a better understanding. <heading>Section 6</heading>We now define soluble groups, which Galois studied when working on the solution of polynomials by radical. Definition 6.1 A finite group is soluble if it has a series of subgroups  FORMULA  such that each  FORMULA  is a proper normal subgroup of Gi and each  FORMULA  is abelian. The next results are the second and third isomorphism theorems which will enhance our knowledge about soluble groups. Theorem 6.2 Suppose G is a group and H is normal to G and K is a subgroup of G. i)  FORMULA  is normal to K and  FORMULA . ii) If  FORMULA  and K is normal to G then H is normal to K, K/H is normal to G/H and (G/H)(K/H) = G/K. Proof: Take  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  then  FORMULA . Define  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . so  FORMULA  with kernel  FORMULA . By the first isomorhism theorem, the result holds. • Only the proof for the first part is stated here since the second part is not required at the moment. For any interested parties, there are proofs of this theorem in almost every algebra book on the second year level. We now look at some conditions for groups to be soluble. This will be a great help in following theorems since we are searching for soluble groups. Theorem 6.3 i) If H is a subgroup of a soluble group G then H is soluble. ii) Suppose H is a normal subgroup of a group G. G/H and H are soluble iff G is soluble. iii) If N and G/N are soluble then G is soluble. Proof: i) Let  FORMULA  be a series for G with Gi+1/Gi abelian. Let  FORMULA . Then H has a series of subgroups such that  FORMULA . So, FORMULA . We get this result from the isomorphism theorem we have just proved. This is a subgroup of Gi+1/Gi so we have H soluble since Hi+1/Hi. ii) Define Gi as above. Then G/N has a series  FORMULA . We write the quotient as  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  which is obviously abelian. So G/N is soluble. (Page 116, IN Stewart, Galois Theory, Chapman and Hall (1973)). iii) Let  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  with their quotients being abelian. Then the series  FORMULA . The quotients are N i+1/Ni which is abelian and  FORMULA  which is also abelian. So G is soluble. • Definition 6.4 A group G is simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial cases e and G. Theorem 6.5 A soluble group is simple if and only if it is cyclic of prime order. Proof: Let G be a simple soluble group. It has a series of normal subgroups and its only normal subgroups are {1} and G. So Gn-1 = {1} and G = G/{1} which is an abelian quotient group. We know every subgroup of an abelian group is normal and each  FORMULA  generates a cyclic subgroup. Then G must be cyclic and hence |G| = p where p is prime. Conversely, if |G| = p and G is cyclic, it has not non-trivial proper subgroups and hence it is simple. • Theorem 6.6 If n ≥ 5 then the alternating group An of degree n is simple. Proof: Let us have a normal subgroup  FORMULA  and suppose that N contains a 3-cycle. Without loss of generality, N contains (123). For m > 3 we have (321) in An and  FORMULA  which is in N. Then N contains  FORMULA  for all m > 3. We know An is generated by all elements of the form (1i)(1j) = (1ij). We see  FORMULA  so that A n is generated by 3-cycles (12m) and N = A n. We need to prove that N contains a 3-cycle for the proof to make sense. Case 1: Suppose N contains a = bcd where  FORMULA  is a cycle of length greater or equal to 4. If p = (b1b2b3) then N contains  FORMULA  and p commutes with c and d so  FORMULA  and N contains  FORMULA . Case 2: Let N contain an element involving at least two 3-cycles. Without loss of generality, take a = (123)(456)b. Let c = (234), then N contains  FORMULA  and by Case 1 N contains a 3-cycle. Case 3: If N contains an element of the form a = (lmn)p with p being a product of 2-cycles, the N contains a 2 = (lnm). Case 4: Let N be the product of two cycles. Assume N contains a + (12)(34)b. Let c = (234) and  FORMULA  is in N. If d = (145) then N contains  FORMULA  and N contains (45)(23)(14)(23) = (145). This proves the theorem. • Corollary 6.7 The symmetric group Sn of degree n is not soluble if n > 5. Proof: Let Sn be soluble for n > 5. Then so is An which is simple. Then An is cyclic of prime order. We know I  FORMULA  which is not prime for n > 5. So we have a contradiction and Sn is not soluble. • We can see how this particular corollary leads us to the issue of the quintic. We now define radical extensions. We are now beginning the exploration of soluble polynomials by radicals, because any radical expression is contained in a radical extension Definition 6.8 N:M is an extension by radicals if N can be obtained by successively adjoining radicals i.e if there exists an integer m(i) such that  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Example 6.9 Let us say that we need to find a radical extension of Q for the following elements of C :  FORMULA . We need to adjoin the elements  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  so we obtain the radical extension  FORMULA . • So we can now ask when is a polynomial soluble by radicals? Definition 6.10 Suppose f is polynomial over M. f is soluble by radicals if there exists a field N containing Σ, the splitting field over M, such that N:M is a radical extension. Definition 6.11 If f is a polynomial over K and has a splitting field Σ over K then the Galois group of f over K is Γ(Σ : K), the group of K-automorphisms of Σ. There seems to be on link between Galois and radicals yet. We now state a crucial theorem. Theorem 6.12 Let f be a polynomial over K of characteristic zero. If f is soluble by radicals then the Galois group of f over K is soluble. Outline of Proof: We let M0 be the fixed field of Γ(N : M). We also let Q : P be a normal closure of P : M. Then  FORMULA . Using two unproved theorems, we can say that P : M0 is a normal radical extension and that its Galois group is soluble.By a further unstated theorem, we can say that Γ(N : M0) is normal. By the Galois correspondence,  FORMULA . So theorem 6.3(ii) implies that Γ(N : M0) is soluble. But Γ(N : M0) = Γ(N : M) so Γ(N : M) is soluble. This proves that if  FORMULA  and P : M is radical then Γ(N : M) is soluble. By the above definitions, this is equivalent to the statement of the theorem. •. The best proof can be found on page 255, I.N Hernstein's Topics in Algebra, Wiley (1964). It is interesting to look at the radical formulas for polynomials of degree > 2 and this will become important later. Example 6.13 Let f(x) = ax 2 + bx + c be a polynomial over K where a=0. We complete the square as in Example 1.1 and we see that if the field is not of characteristic 2, the splitting field of f is  FORMULA . If K is of characteristic 2, then x 2 + c = 0 so the spltting field is  FORMULA . • We know that there are radical formulas for cubic and quartic polynomials. Now let us find a polynomial not soluble by radicals. First we need two theorems. Theorem 6.14 The group S n is generated by the cycles (12.. .n) and (12) for any n, Proof: Let a = (12...n) and b = (12). Let G be generated by a and b, so G contains  FORMULA . Then G contains all (k,k + 1), and hence all (1k). Then G contain all (1k)(1m)(1k) = (km) and hence G = S n. • (INS) This is necessary for the next proof. Theorem 6.15 Let f be an irreducible polynomial of degree p over Q, for some prime p. Suppose f has two non-real zeros in C. Then the Galois group of f over Q is S p. Proof: We know C contains a splitting field Σ for f. Let Γ be the Galois group of f over Q, considered as a permutation group on the zeros of f, and these are distinct since the characteristic is zero so that Γ is a subgroup of S p. Obviously [Σ : Q] is divisible by p, so by Theorem 5.1  FORMULA  is divisible by p. From Algebra II this means that G has an element of order p. The only element of S p having order p are the p-cycles. Complex conjugation is seen to be a Q-automorphism of C giving a Q-automorphism of Σ. This fixes the real zeros and transposes the two non-real zeros to their complex conjugates so G contains a 2-cycle. We assume G contains a p-cycle and a 2-cycle. Then G = S p by the previous theorem. • Now to find a quintic that can't be solved by radicals. Example 6.16 The polynomial x 5 - 4x 2 + 2 over Q is not soluble by radicals. Let f(x) = x 5 - 6x 2 + 3. By Eisenstein's irreducibilty criterion f is irreducible over Q. We need to show that f has two zeros in C, which is simple to show by applying Rolle's theorem to the zeros of f. By Theorem 5.8, the Galois group of Q is S5. S5 is not soluble so by 5.7, f is not soluble by radicals. • We can show that a polynomial is not soluble by radicals if it does not satisfy the condition that its degree n < 5. This is a wonderful but regularly misinterpreted theorem. Theorem 6.17 If n > 5 then the general polynomial of degree n is not soluble by radicals. Proof: Let M be any field and f be the general polynomial of degree n over M. Then the Galois group of  FORMULA  is S n where Σ is the splitting field for f (For a proof see I.N Stewart's Galois Theory, Chapman and Hall/CRC (1973)). We know that S n is not a solvable group. By Theorem 6.7, f is not soluble by radicals. • Now we prove a theorem that leads to 6.19, giving us a guide to when a polynomial is solvable. Theorem 6.18 Let M have characteristic zero and N : M be a finite normal extension with soluble Galois group Γ(L : K). Then there exists an extension of N, say P, such that P : M is radical. (DHJ Garling's First Course in Galois Theory, CUP (1986)). To prove Theorem 6.19 we need only use Theorems 6.12 and 6.18. Theorem 6.19 Over a field of characteristic zero, a polynomial is soluble iff it has a soluble Galois group. Proof: Let K be of characteristic 0 with a polynomial f over K. Let M:K be a finite normal extension with soluble Galois group Γ(Σ : K). We know that the exists an extension N of M such that N : K is radical. By definition 6.5, f is soluble. We know that if f is soluble by radicals then the Galois group of f over K is soluble. • So we can know, by calculating the Galois group of f over K, if f is soluble by radicals. <heading>Section 7</heading>Interestingly, the last section indicates that polynomials of degree n > 5 are insoluble by radicals but not, as taken by many, that the quintic can not be solved at all. We will examine a few methods in the next three sections, drawing on our knowledge of algebra, analysis and geometry. In 1877 the German mathematician Felix Klein (he of the famous Klein bottle) published his Lectures on the Icosahedron and the Solution of Equations of the Fifth Degree. Example 7.1 Klein manipulated the general quintic  FORMULA  into a form that was solvable ( URL ). To show this simply we take a monic quintic (leading coefficient of 1) polynomial  FORMULA  and substitute  FORMULA  so we can write the polynomial as  FORMULA  with  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . This is called a Tschirnhaus transformation. Klein used a similar transformation to reduce the general quintic to  FORMULA . This is explained in a later section. He then solved the equivalent icosahedral equation thus solving the quintic. • How do we reduce the quintic into a form so that it is equivalent to the icosahedral equation? What is the icosahedral equation? To understand this method we must first define the stereographic projection, with which you may be familiar. Stereographic projection is a homeomorphism  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is the unit sphere and n denotes the north pole. The map is defined by  FORMULA  an intersection of the plane and the line through n and p. We can write  FORMULA  since we need  FORMULA  so we must have  FORMULA  Definition 7.2 It can also be defined as a function of the form  FORMULA  with h(z) = 0 and complex differentiable on all finite points of C. ( URL ) The complex field C contain x+iy for (x, y) in the plane R 2. The Riemann sphere is a set  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is a point not in C. Taking the Riemann sphere as a topological space we can extend the stereographic projection  FORMULA  defined by  FORMULA . Let us set up an equivalence class on C 2. If  FORMULA  then each vector is related if (z 1, z2) = k.(c1,c2) for some  FORMULA . Call the set of equivalence classes, (z1|z2), P(C) in C 2/{0}. We see that we can write  FORMULA  so we see that P(C) is topologically equivalent to the Riemann sphere. Let  FORMULA  be a polynomial in the ring of polynomials over the complex plane. P is called a form if  FORMULA . A pair of forms of the same degree  FORMULA  gives an algebraic mapping  FORMULA  defined by  FORMULA . This is well defined since  FORMULA  is a homeomorphism so we can set up a map between the projective complex line and itself with  FORMULA  depending only on  FORMULA . So any meromorphic function can be expressed as an algebraic mapping. If we dehomogenize the forms, let Z2 = 1, we have a correspondence  FORMULA  and similarly in the other direction. Let us introduce the notation  FORMULA  for dehomogenization. So we write  FORMULA . An automorphism of the Riemann sphere is a meromorphic bijection on S. The finite groups of such automorphisms are classified up to conjugacy by rotation groups. Importantly for us, the rotation groups of Platonic solids are some of these groups. The set of automorphisms of the Riemann sphere, let us denote it A(S), contains fractional linear transformations  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Definition 7.3 The general linear group of two times two complex matrices with nonzero determinant is written as  FORMULA . The group maps to A(S), and we can write  FORMULA  for all  FORMULA . We will now show that the image of  FORMULA  is a group so that  FORMULA  is a homomorphism. It is a surjective homomorphism since any of the automorphisms can be written as fa for some  FORMULA . Theorem 7.4 The image of  FORMULA  under a map to  FORMULA  is a group. Proof: The composition of maps is known to be associative, and obviously and inverse and identity are contained in A(S) since it consists of meromorphic bijections. So to show that the image of  FORMULA  is a group, we only need to show that it is closed. If  FORMULA  then  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA . So if  FORMULA  then  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  is a group. • From this result we observe that the projective linear group  FORMULA , with element  FORMULA , is isomorphic to  FORMULA  by the First Isomorphism Theorem since  FORMULA  where  FORMULA . By further examination we see that  FORMULA  is isomorphic to  FORMULA , the projective special linear group where  FORMULA , since  FORMULA . We can then see that constant through linear maps are absorbed by projective classes. These results will become useful shortly. It is easily proved that a matrix A is orthogonal if it preserves inner products so (Ax, Ay) = (x, y). We use this to prove: Theorem 7.5 The orthogonal matrices form a group  FORMULA , and the special orthogonal matrices  FORMULA  form a subgroup of index 2. Let A be an orthogonal matrix. Then (Ax, Ay) = (x, y) and (Bx, By) = (x, y) so (ABx, ABy) = (A[Bx], A[By]) = (Ax, Ay) = (x,y). So if  FORMULA  then  FORMULA . Obviously (Ix,Iy) = (x,y) so  FORMULA . If we have  FORMULA  then (Ax, Ay) = (A[BC]x, A[BC]y) = ([AB]Cx, [AB]Cy) = (ABx, ABy) = (Ax, Ay).  FORMULA  shows that  FORMULA  is invertible. Once we know this we can show that  FORMULA  is a group isomorphic to  FORMULA  and using this result we can show  FORMULA . Introducing  FORMULA  of unitary matrices,  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is the adjoint. A matrix is special unitary if and only if it is of the form  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . We can show  FORMULA . This leads to, Theorem 7.6 As a subgroup of  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Proof: We show that any rotation lies in  FORMULA . Take the antipodal pair  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Suppose they have stereographic images  FORMULA , FORMULA  so let p = (p1,p2,p 3) and  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  taking  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA  be a rotation of the Riemann sphere. This is induced by a rotation r of S 2, which we know takes antipodal pairs to antipodal pairs. Hence f must satisfy f(z)* = f(z*) for nonzero z. By calculating as necessary, we see that the condition is equivalent to saying  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  using the condition that ad - bc = 1 for unitary matrices. Then  FORMULA . For the converse, take  FORMULA . Let f (0) = 0. If  FORMULA  then if f (0) = 0 we must have  FORMULA  and b = 0 hence  FORMULA . Then we see  FORMULA  so that  FORMULA , so f is rotation. If  FORMULA  then some rotation  FORMULA  takes z to 0. Then  FORMULA  fixes zero and is thus a rotation. Hence  FORMULA  is a rotation and the proof is complete. • This theorem and the result  FORMULA  gives a relationship between automorphisms of the Riemann sphere and rotation groups. We must assume the following. Theorem 7.7 If  FORMULA  is a surjective group homomorphism,  FORMULA  is a subgroup and  FORMULA  then H is a subgroup of G. If kerf and H' are finite then  FORMULA . Proposition 7.8 Any finite subgroup G of GL2(C) is conjugate to a subgroup of U 2(C). We can use Proposition 7.8 to prove that finite groups of bijective meromorphisms are classified up to conjugation by rotation groups. Theorem 7.9 All finite groups of automorphisms of the sphere are conjugate to a rotation group. Let  FORMULA  be a finite group of automorphisms. By Theorem 6.6 we see that there is a finite group  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  since  FORMULA . By Proposition 6.7,  FORMULA  is conjugate to a subgroup of  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  is such that  FORMULA  has  FORMULA . As such, it defines an element  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . So a finite subgroup of  FORMULA  is conjugate to a subgroup of  FORMULA . Since  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  this proves the theorem. • So we have proved the relationship between rotations of the sphere and rotation groups. Next we find these rotation groups. First we must prove the theorems we assumed. This theorem uses a relationship between inner product and Hermitian positive matrices, Hermitian meaning self-adjoint A* = A and positive meaning x* Ax > 0 for nonzero  FORMULA . Specifically, given an inner product  FORMULA  on  FORMULA  satisfying the standard properties we have  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is defined by  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is a standard basis vector. By using the inner product properties it is easily proved that every Hermitian matrix has real eigenvalues. A bit more work shows that a unitary matrix diagonalises the Hermitian matrix. This implies that a Hermitian matrix H is positive if and only if its eigenvalues are real and positive. So it must satisfy H = A 2 where A is Hermitian positive. So an Hermitian inner product has form  FORMULA  if it satisfies the standard properties.. Proof of Proposition 7.8 Define an inner product  FORMULA  on C 2 by averaging the usual one over G,  FORMULA  The new inner product is G-invariant meaning  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . It satisfies the usual inner product properties, so [x, y] = (Ax, Ay) for some Hermitian positive A and all  FORMULA . Therefore, for any  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  so  FORMULA  is unitary. • (Page 28, Geometry Of The Quintic, Jerry Shurman, Wiley (1997)) We show that the inner product is G-invariant in order to validate the proof. Theorem 7.10  FORMULA  is G-invariant.  FORMULA  where  FORMULA . This theorem follows simply from our knowledge of homomorphisms. Proof of Theorem 7.7 Let H' be a subgroup of G1. Suppose  FORMULA  Then  FORMULA  since H' is a subgroup. Then  FORMULA  since f(ab) = f(a)f(b). We must have  FORMULA  so since e' = f(e) we have  FORMULA . With  FORMULA  we have  FORMULA  so  FORMULA . Since  FORMULA  we have  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  so H is a subgroup of G. We can set up an isomorphism  FORMULA . So  FORMULA and since kerf and H' are finite we can write  FORMULA . • What are the Platonic solids? Simply they are any one of five solids whose faces are congruent regular polygons and whose polyhedral angles are all congruent. However, we can give a much better definition: Definition 7.11 Any polyhedron whose symmetry groups act on the sequence (v, e, f), where v is a vertex, e is an edge with v in e and f is a polygon with e in f, is a Platonic solid. ( URL  and  URL  In this case we can use the Schlfli symbol (m,n), where m is the number of edges meeting at each vertex and n denotes the edges of the polygons, to describe the polyhedra. We have (3, 3), (3,4), (4,3), (3, 5), (5,3) for the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedon and icosahedron. To dualise a Platonic solid we place vertices at the face-centers of the original polyhedron and connect the pairs from adjacent faces so we take (m,n) to (n,m). The dual can be shown to have the same symmetries as the original polyhedron and the sequence (v,e, f) is mapped bijectively from the original solid. We see that the octahedron is the dual of the cube, the icosahedron is the dual of the dodecahedron and the dual of the tetrahedron is another tetrahedron. The icosahedron is constructed by taking the positive root of  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Take three rectangles in the coordinate plane centred at the origin, with sides of length 2 and 2r. We get the icosahedron by connecting vertices. It can be proved that possible rotations are 15 about antipodal pairs on the mid-points (order 2), twenty rotations about each antipodal pair in face centers (order 3), twenty four abut each antipodal vertex pair (order 5) and the identity rotation. Theorem 7.12 There are only 60 possible rotations of the icosahedron. Proof: Take a nonidentity rotation about a point p, lying in some face of the icosahedron. If p is a vertex the rotation has been counted. If not the rotation permutes the vertices on the face containging p. Then p has at least two nearest vertices which implies that it is a face-center or a mid-edge point. So there are no other rotations of the icosahedron. • We have already proved that rotation groups of the sphere are conjugate to rotation groups. It is possible to show: Theorem 7.13 Each finite rotation group of the sphere is isomorphic to one of the following groups: <list>1. Cyclic groups  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . Dihedral groups  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . 3. Platonic rotation groups A 4,S 4 and A5.</list>Any two finite rotation groups of the same form are conjugate, so these isomorphism classes are also the conjugacy classes. (Page 40, Geometry Of The Quintic, Jerry Shurman, Wiley (1997)) Outline of Proof: Take Γ a finite rotation group acting on S 2. Start from  FORMULA  which follows from the orbit-stabilizer theorem. This can be replaced by  FORMULA , summing over degenerate orbits. Letting  FORMULA  we see,  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  Now, we know  FORMULA  and that  FORMULA . This gives  FORMULA  for each degenerate orbit . We see that  FORMULA  so  FORMULA  where m is the number of degenerate orbits. We see  FORMULA  giving  FORMULA  so  FORMULA  so obviously  FORMULA . If k = 2;  FORMULA  so that  FORMULA . This implies that Γ is cyclic. If k = 3; we can easily see that  FORMULA  are given as <list>1)  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and flag  FORMULA ; dihedral 2)  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and flag  FORMULA ; tetrahedral 3)  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and flag  FORMULA ; octahedral 4)  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and flag  FORMULA ; icosahedral.•</list>If Γ is a finite rotation groups, we can say that a meromorphic function on S is Γ-invariant if  FORMULA . Theorem 7.14 A meromorphic function is Γ-invariant iff it is invariant under a set of generators for Γ. Proof: Let α be a generator of Γ and let f be a meromorphic function  FORMULA . Take f to be Γ-invariant,  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA  for α a generator of Γ. The proof follows from definition. • We know any meromorphic function can be expressed as an algebraic mapping. If we think of  FORMULA  as the group of linear maps  FORMULA , we know  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  such that Γ can be viewed as the linear maps  FORMULA . We can show that for each  FORMULA . Then, Theorem 7.15 For all algebraic mapping and  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . This shows that  FORMULA  if and only if  FORMULA . Proof: We know  FORMULA  so  FORMULA . We also know  FORMULA  so  FORMULA . So  FORMULA  and proving this for  FORMULA  merely requires us to consider that P and Q are homogeneous forms and that (P|Q) = 3. • Then, Theorem 7.16 The algebraic mapping  FORMULA  is Γ-invariant if and only if for each  FORMULA  there exists some nonzero complex number  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . In other words, f is Γ-invariant if and only if P and Q both transform by some common factor C under  FORMULA . (Page 51, Geometry Of The Quintic, Jerry Shurman, Wiley (1997)) The proof of this theorem is much simpler when this definition is introduced. Definition 7.17 A nonzero form  FORMULA  is  FORMULA -invariant with character Cp if there exists some functions  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . Proof of 7.16: P and Q are relatively prime so let  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . Then C(γ) must be constant from a comparison of degrees. We know that constants through linear maps are absorbed by projective classes. So P,Q are Γ'-invariant. By Theorem 7.13, f is Γ-invariant. Conversely; f is Γinvariant. Then  FORMULA  for some constant C(γ;). • Definition 7.18 A full orbit-form for a finite rotation group Γ is a form of degree  FORMULA  with its zeroes on one orbit  FORMULA , and a zero of the same order at each orbit point. This type of form is Γ'-invariant, as explained in INS. A nondegenerate orbit-form is expressed as  FORMULA . A full orbit-form for degenerate orbits  FORMULA , is expressed as a power P i for  FORMULA  with degree  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Pi is known as a degenerate orbit-form. Theorem 7.19 The full orbit forms are the linear combinations  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . Proof: We can see that P is a full orbit-form if  FORMULA  or  FORMULA . If this is not the case then the zeroes of P are a union of multisets of orbits of length  FORMULA , where a multiset is defined as  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . So this is not O 1 or O2. So P must be  FORMULA  or the form of a full orbit. So P is a full orbit-form. In the other direction, if we take any orbit of a point p and set  FORMULA , then P vanishes at p. • Theorem 7.20 The general invariant form is given by  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  for only finitely many λ. (INS) Since Theorem 7.19 proves that  FORMULA  are linearly dependent we have, Definition 7.21 A syzygy is a linear relation such that  FORMULA . Take a real valued function on an open subset  FORMULA . The Hessian matrix of f at  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  is defined as the n x n matrix  FORMULA  (Page 33, Sean Dineen's Multivariate Calculus and Geometry, Springer (1994)). The Hessian matrix crops up in multivariate calculus and is at the heart of a very neat theorem which can be used to find local maxima, local minima and saddle points on real-valued functions defined on  FORMULA . The determinant of the Hessian matrix of the form P is know as the Hessian of P, HP. Similarly, the Jacobian JP of P is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix for the vector-valued function (P, HP). A covariant is a function  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  and for Γ-invariant P we have  FORMULA  if  FORMULA  for all  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . So VP is also Γ-invariant. H and J are both covariants . Example 7.22 The Hessian is a covariant. Take a linear mapping  FORMULA , with matrix having determinant 1. Then  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Now  FORMULA  by the chain rule. Then  FORMULA  by another application of the chain rule. So  FORMULA  so the Hessian is a covariant. • The Jacobian can be shown to be a covariant in a similar manner. By Theorem 7.19 we need only find the degenerate orbit-forms to find all invariant forms. The Jacobian and Hessian of a form P are used to this end. Differentiating twice reduces the degree of F by 2 so it is easy to see that HF is a form of degree 2(deg(F) - 2) and similarly JF has degree 3(deg(F) - 2). We see that for the Platonic rotation groups  FORMULA  and  FORMULA , so  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . As an example take the group of rotations of the icosahedron. There are  FORMULA  rotations about face centers,  FORMULA  rotations about the vertices and  FORMULA . So to find  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  we need only find  FORMULA . For the icosahedral case, we simply substitue the vertices from  FORMULA  into the full orbit form. So we find  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Then the syzygy on degenerate icosahedral forms can be written as  FORMULA . Theorem 7.23 The Γ-invariant algebraic mappings are  FORMULA ; G, H are disjoint products o (Geometry of the Quintic, Jerry Shurman, Wiley (1997)) Proof: If f is a nonconstant Γ-invariant algebraic mapping it takes every value in P(C) on a union of multisets of Γ-orbits. Then its degree is divisible by Γ, so by Theorem 6.18 G and H are both products of full orbit-forms multiplied by an exceptional form,  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  for only finitely many  FORMULA . By Lemma 7.24 below, this cannot be the case since we need P and Q to share the same character. Conversely,any f of this sort is invariant so the result is obvious. • Lemma 7.24 No two exceptional forms share the same character. (Page63,JerryShurman,Wiley (1997)) From this follows, Theorem 7.25 The Γ -invariant algebraic mappings of degree Γ are FORMULA . Since we know that there is a correspondence between algebraic mappings  FORMULA  and rational functions  FORMULA  we can take Theorem 7.24 as a statement about the set Γ-invariant rational functions. Then we see, Theorem 7.26 The field  FORMULA  of Γ-invariant rational functions is equal to  FORMULA  for any Γ-invariant  FORMULA  with degree  FORMULA . From Theorem 7.23 and the correspondence  FORMULA  wehave  FORMULA :  FORMULA ; P,Q are disjoint products of full orbit-foms. This is clearly equal to  FORMULA . So  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA . Conversely,  FORMULA  by Theorem 7.24. • This means that a Γ-invariant rational function f of degree Γ, for each rotation group Γ, generates the field  FORMULA  of Γ-invariant rational functions. So  FORMULA  generates  FORMULA , the rational functions that are invariant under actions of the group of rotations of the icosahedron. But what is  FORMULA ? Let us take two rational functions that are related by a fractional linear transformation, such that both take distinct points  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . Since all these points end up at the same image point under both maps it becomes clear that they are equal. So any Γ-invariant function of degree  FORMULA  is determined by its values on three distinct orbits. Take  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  for some scalars a, b and remembering our definition of the syzygy, we see  FORMULA . <heading>Section 8</heading>Now we find the Brioschi resolvent of  FORMULA . This is found by inverting  FORMULA . We know that  FORMULA  is a map the set of Γ-orbits. By inverting  FORMULA  we can recover the orbit. Now we return to Galois theory. We want to examine the specific extension  FORMULA . Letting  FORMULA  we can write  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  since we can write  FORMULA . So the extension  FORMULA  is obtained by adjoining the root of pw to C(W). From Definition 3.8 we see that C(Z) is the splitting field of pw since the roots of pw are  FORMULA  which are elements of C(Z). Then we can show that for a rotation group Γ we have, Theorem 8.1  FORMULA  Proof: The roots of pw, the elements of ΓZ, are distinct so they occur once and  FORMULA  by some group theory. Now we know  FORMULA  and from some ring theory from Algebra II we see that this is a  FORMULA . So it follows that pw is a product of irreducibles. INS. So pw is irreducible, it is the minimum polynomial over C(W) so  FORMULA . • Theorems 6.12 and Theorem 6.17 tell us that L : K is a radical extension if and only if its Galois group Gal(L : K) is soluble. If we take Γ to be a solvable group then C(Z) : C(W) is a radical extensions, since  FORMULA  by the Galois correspondence.. We see the containments given by  FORMULA  which are normal to each other; and  FORMULA  mean we can construct polynomials  FORMULA  when  FORMULA  and inverting W involves fining the roots of this polynomial, and similarly for other Γ. However, this is not the case for the icosahedral group of rotations is not solvable. Theorem 8.2 The group of rotations of the icosahedron ΓI is simple. Proof: We know that since  FORMULA  we have  FORMULA  which we know to be simple by Theorem 6.6. • Let the extension L : K be normal and separable and let Gal(L : K) = G. Take  FORMULA  which is fixed by  FORMULA . We have  FORMULA  and each  FORMULA  acts on r as g. The resolvent of κ is  FORMULA . The polynomial is G-invariant since  FORMULA . We can show that the resolvent is the minimum polynomial of κ over K so by correct choice of κ we can construct intermediate fields between K and L. So we can construct resolvents for C(Z) : C(W), with  FORMULA  for some rotation group Γ, which reduce to the polynomials discussed in the previous paragraph. It is possible to show that the icosahedral group of rotations has five tetrahedral subgroups that stabilize the configuration discussed in Section 7. 'Single out the stabilizing group  FORMULA  of the configuration originally set in the coordinate planes but then rotated about the x2-axis. Thus  FORMULA  (Jerry Shurman, Geometry of the Quintic, Wiley (1997)). If κ is a  FORMULA -invariant function then it has a resolvent of degree  FORMULA . Taking ΓI to  FORMULA  we can construct a resolvent  FORMULA  which has degree 5. The rotation α of the octahedron about the x2-axis shows that  FORMULA  and by calculating this form we arrive at  FORMULA  where  FORMULA . Then inverting  FORMULA  involves finding finding a root of the Brioschi resolvent and a root of  FORMULA . So we see that the icosahedral inverse solves the Brioschi quintic, and inverting  FORMULA  involves solving the Brioschi quintic. <heading>Section 9</heading>Now that we know that solving the icosahedral equation is equivalent to solving its Brioschi resolvent, the way forward is clear. We know the resolvent is of the form  FORMULA  so the questions are whether the general quintic can be reduced to this form, and how. First of all how do we transform a polynomial to another, simpler, polynomial? A Tschirnhaus transformation is a polynomial g such that given  FORMULA , with  FORMULA  with a i the coefficient of f, we can define a new polynomial  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  for  FORMULA  for some extension N of M. Let  FORMULA  be algebraically independent. Any monic polynomial has the expansion  FORMULA  where the elementary symmetric functions of  FORMULA  (Geometry of the Quintic, Jerry Shurman, Wiley (1997)). We can see that however we permute  FORMULA , the  FORMULA  are invariant. Theorem 9.1 If  FORMULA  are algebraically independent then there is no nonzero rational function  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . Proof: Assume that such a nonzero rational function exists. There exists no polynomial  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  Let the nonzero rational function  FORMULA . Adding 1 to both sides and multiplying by  FORMULA  we have  FORMULA  so  FORMULA . This gives a contradiction so there is no such nonzero rational function. • We see that the extension  FORMULA  is normal and separable by Theorem 3.14 and Theorem 3.19. Let  FORMULA .  FORMULA  since an automorphism of  FORMULA  over  FORMULA  permutes the roots of p so G is a subgroup S n and each permutation of the roots is an automorphism of  FORMULA  which fixes  FORMULA  by our earlier statement so that S n is a subgroup of G. Theorem 9.2 If  FORMULA  are algebraically independent then so are their elementary symmetric functions  FORMULA . Proof: There exists no polynomial  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  Take  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  the associated elementary functions. Each entry is a polynomial  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  So there is no polynomial g in  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA . • So, going back to the Tschirnhaus transformation, h has degree n and its coefficients  FORMULA . we see  FORMULA .  FORMULA  if and only if  FORMULA  such that  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Following from the previous theorem,  FORMULA  can be given any value. By the expansion of p, we can take it as the general polynomial of degree n over C. So it lies in the field  FORMULA . So  FORMULA  and has n distinct roots in  FORMULA . Then p is a separable polynomial. So the Galois group of this polynomial is the Galois group of the splitting field extension  FORMULA .  FORMULA  since an automorphism of  FORMULA  over  FORMULA . This gives, Theorem 9.3 The Galois group of the general polynomial g of degree n over C is  FORMULA . Definition 9.4 The discriminant of the polynomial p is  FORMULA  The following follows, Theorem 9.5 The discriminant  FORMULA  is invariant under permutations of  FORMULA  for any transposition of  FORMULA  Proof: Let us have  FORMULA  and permute it to get  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA . So we see that the discriminant is invariant under permutation. Let us have a transposition  FORMULA .  FORMULA . Under the transposition we have  FORMULA  since the only new term is  FORMULA . • So we can see that An fixes  FORMULA . Back in the Tschirnhaus transformation, we can calculate h from f and g in the following way. Ostensibly, the resultant of two polynomials is a good way to find whether they have roots in common without the tedious calculation of roots. Let  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  in  FORMULA . These are general when the coefficient are algebraically independent. Theorem 9.6 Polynomials p and q share a common non-constant factor if and only if there exist nonzero polynomials  FORMULA  of degree less than n and  FORMULA  of degree less than m, such that  FORMULA . Proof: Let  FORMULA  of degree less than n and  FORMULA  of degree less than m, such that  FORMULA  exist. In their splitting field over  FORMULA  we can factorize p and q as  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Since P and Q are of degree less than n and m we have P and Q changing a polynomial of degree less than m and P and Q have common factors. So then p and q must have common factors. Conversely, p and q have a common factor. So divide by the common factor an we can find polynomials of degree less than n and m such that  FORMULA  and multiplying by the common factor we have  FORMULA . • The resultant of two polynomials  FORMULA  is the determinant of what is known as the Sylvester matrix with staggered rows of  FORMULA , then staggered rows of  FORMULA  and all other entries zero. Theorem 9.7 The polynomials p and q in  FORMULA  share a nonconstant factor if and only if  FORMULA . We know that there exist P and Q of lower degree such that  FORMULA  or  FORMULA . This is the same as saying that  FORMULA  with  FORMULA  which is true if and only if  FORMULA . So  FORMULA . If  FORMULA  there exists a nonzero solution v. So the necessary P and Q exist, so p and share a nonconstant factor. •. We can think of R(p, q) as a formula applying to all polynomials of degree n and m. Calculating detM is obviously a long string of calculation but we can use a much simpler way. The following theorem gives us a simple method. Theorem 9.8 The resultant of  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  is given by  FORMULA . In their splitting field over  FORMULA  we can factorize p and q as  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . We write  FORMULA . This is a homogeneous polynomial of degree mn which is zero if and only if p and q share a root., so dividing the resultant. For p, each  FORMULA  so each coefficient has homogeneous degree i, and similarly for q. Then we see that the (i, j)th entry of the corresponding Sylvester matrix has degree j - i for  FORMULA , FORMULA  in the ri and j - i + n for  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  in the sj. We then see that any nonzero term in the determinant R(p,q) has degree mn in the ri,sj. So  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  agree up to some multiplicative constant. Finding the constant is a simple matter of matching coefficients. • (Jerry Shurman, Geometry of the Quintic, Wiley (1997)) Going back to the Tschirnhaus transformation again we note that since we know that  FORMULA  is equivalent to  FORMULA  and  FORMULA , we can write  FORMULA . This is explained below, Example 9.9 We know  FORMULA . So  FORMULA . We know that  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . We know  FORMULA  so h and  FORMULA  vanish for the same values of S, so  FORMULA . • Two examples interest us, a Tschirnhaus transformation that reduces the general polynomial to a form with the a zero coefficeient to the term  FORMULA , so-called depressed form, and principal form with zero coefficient for terms  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Example 9.10 To find the depressed form we need to choose the transformation  FORMULA  so that the transformed polynomial has  FORMULA . We know  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  FORMULA . So  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . •. The principal form is a more complicated reduction since  FORMULA . We need some new mathematics to ease us through the calculations. The power sums of  FORMULA  are  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA . The derivative  FORMULA . If we derive lnp we get  FORMULA  by the formulas for geometric series. So  FORMULA . Equating coefficients gives Newton's identities  FORMULA . Theorem 9.11 The first j coefficients  FORMULA  of the polynomial  FORMULA  are zero exactly when the first j power sums of its roots vanish. Outline of Proof: This follows from the fact that for any  FORMULA  ,sj are polynomials in  FORMULA  and vice versa. We see that for some j = n we have  FORMULA  When j = n - 1 we have  FORMULA  Then  FORMULA  so  FORMULA  is written as a polynomial in  FORMULA . This works the other way in a similar manner. Take  FORMULA . Replace the last column by  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . Then the Vandermonde matrix is  FORMULA  and its determinant is  FORMULA . Take the transpose of the Vandermonde matrix  FORMULA . If we left multiply the Vandermonde matrix by its transpose we get  FORMULA  with determinant  FORMULA . We can now transform the general polynomial p of degree n into principal form. Example 9.12 To find the principal form we need to choose the transformation  FORMULA  so that the transformed polynomial has  FORMULA . We know  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA . We know from Newton's identities that  FORMULA . This means that  FORMULA  since we know that  FORMULA . So  FORMULA . From Theorem 9.11 we set  FORMULA . So we solve for T the quadratic  FORMULA  where the  FORMULA  are the power sums for  FORMULA . Solving this quadratic for  FORMULA  gives the transformation. We now know that we can write the general quintic in principal form. This is displayed as  FORMULA . This has three paramaters  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  and the goal is to reduce it to a one-parameter form, the Brioschi form. To do this we must first explore some new ideas. Consider the Tschirnhaus transformation geometrically. This is a fascinating subject and it is intuitive that the transformation moves the so-called root vector  FORMULA  to  FORMULA . Without getting distracted, we can make a few observations. We define n-dimensional projective space  FORMULA  as a set of equivalence classes on  FORMULA  where x y in  FORMULA  if  FORMULA  for  FORMULA . We see  FORMULA  maps to  FORMULA  under the map  FORMULA . An algebraic set in  FORMULA  is the set of common zeros of a finite set of forms in  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  We see that these sets are structures in  FORMULA . By the transformation t1 of Example 9.10, we make the entries of the root vectors sum to zero. Affine Tschirnhaus transformations  FORMULA  are invertible:  FORMULA . Considering what this implies for the operations on root vectors we can consider a Tschirnhaus transformation as acting on  FORMULA . This surface is known as a hyperplane. A hypersurface A(F) for a single form, a hyperplane is a hypersurface for a linear form. We see from Theorem 9.11 that reduction to principal form can be thought of as transforming  FORMULA  onto the canonical surface  FORMULA . Of course, these ideas are just a small selection of the necessary mathematics to see us to our goal. Theorem 9.13 There exists a  FORMULA , monic of degree three or four, such that  FORMULA . Proof: Let  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  be elements of  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA . We also see  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA =  FORMULA =  FORMULA =  FORMULA . To complete the proof we need  FORMULA . This can be written as  FORMULA . The usual process of finding eigenvalues shows that finding  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  requires  FORMULA  in  FORMULA . Earlier on we expressed the discriminant of a polynomial as a determinant with pwer sum entries. Since p is a principal quintic,  FORMULA . Using the standard, but lengthy, method of row and column operations we get  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA . Then it is obvious that the required square root lies in  FORMULA . The next proof uses the geometry we discussed. Corollary 9.14 Let  FORMULA  lie on the canonical surface C. For any  FORMULA , the  FORMULA -transformed vector  FORMULA  also lies on C. Equivalently, the  FORMULA -transformed principal quintic is also principal. Proof: We know  FORMULA . The transformed vector also lies on C since  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  by Theorem 9.13. This is obviously equivalent to the condition that the transformed principal quintic remaining principal since  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  by Theorem 9.11. It is easily seen that the Tschirnhaus transformation taking  FORMULA  to  FORMULA  is dependent only on  FORMULA . We can see that the transformed polynomial q is wholly dependent on  FORMULA . Using the division algorithm,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  where l is unspecified extension of  FORMULA . Theorem 9.15 There exist a linear form and a quadratic form in  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA , such that  FORMULA . Outline of Proof: We can write  FORMULA . We need to show that  FORMULA  and that  FORMULA . We evaluate the congruence at  FORMULA  and sum over i. Then  FORMULA . This gives r = 0. To show the second part, we need to consider the values for  FORMULA  in Theorem 9.13. Then, the result follows from field operations in  FORMULA . Theorem 9.16 Let k be any field not of characteristic 2. In  FORMULA  let  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Assume that L does not divide Q in  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Then for some  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . This is a straightforward proof using some basic linear algebra. The best proof is in Geometry of the Quintic, Jerry Shurman, Wiley (1997). Now we can find the Brioschi quintic. Take L = L(T, φ) and Q = Q(T, φ) as in Theorem 9.17. Then  FORMULA . and by Theorem 9.14 we have  FORMULA . Now we construct a Tschirnhaus transformation as  FORMULA . To find t we write  FORMULA . This gives  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Solving for t, we have  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Example 9.18 Take the transformed quintic  FORMULA . We see q(S) = 0 when  FORMULA . Write  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  which is zero for  FORMULA . We have a quintic in P with roots which are a linear combination of ri and φ(ri), so this is still principal by Corollary 9.15. The same method is used for  FORMULA . The coefficients of  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  vanish. By expanding and multiplying, the terms vanishing for  FORMULA  are  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . We can easily find the terms for  FORMULA , so we combine the terms. 'Linear algebra shows  FORMULA ' (Page 128, Geometry of the Quintic, Jerry Shurman, Wiley (1997)) . Let  FORMULA , then  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  if we let  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . • We have now reduced the principal quintic to a one parameter form. So even if a quintic is not soluble by radicals it can be done by solving the Brioschi quintic.
