He was assessed in A&E and admitted the same afternoon to CCU. <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background. The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading><heading>Presenting complaint:</heading>Collapse with loss of consciousness <heading>History of presenting complaint:</heading>A similar episode happened 6 months ago, he was running for a ferry and 'keeled over'. He thought he had fainted. He came round very quickly, there had been no warning symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations or breathlessness. He recovered quickly afterwards, he had no limb weakness, he did not feel nauseous, had not bit his tongue or been incontinent during the episode. Between these episodes he felt that he had been 'overdoing it' a few times, he could not explain this further. He has not been to his GP regarding this incident. He has never had any episodes of breathlessness, palpitations, chest pain, intermittent claudication, ankle oedema, orthopneoa or PND. He has had episodes of tiredness but nothing significant.

The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>Likely diagnoses include: Cardiogenic syncope - due to a tachy or brady arrhythmia. It is more likely to be a brady arrhythmia as Mr  did not have any feelings of palpitations, which is more common in episodes of tachyarrhythmias. The vague awareness throughout the episodes and quick recovery would more likely point towards a cardiac arrhythmia cause. Vasovagal syncope - this is less likely as the patient did not have any prodrome, which is suggestive of a vasovagal attack. Neurological causes - such as epilepsy, TIA, CVA are all unlikely as the patient recovered quickly from each episode and there was no residual focal deficits Vasomotor syncope - due to poor control of the circulation at times of demand (such as running for a lift) is a possibility. However, the patient has not suffered form episode of micturition syncope, which is often a preceding problem, before Other causes such as poor eyesight, footwear, electrolyte imbalance, sepsis, PE are all very unlikely from the history and can be pretty much ruled out at this point. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading>A cheerful gentleman sitting comfortably on the bed. No clubbing, peripheral cyanosis, tremour, splinter haemorrhages or xanthomata on his hands. <list>Pulse = 72 bpm and regular, BP = 150/80, 0 2 sats 94% on air, RR = 16, Temp = 36.9 (apyrexial)</list>No evidence of jaundice, anaemia, corneal arcus or xanthelasma in his eyes. No central cyanosis, oedema or lymphadenopathy JVP was not raised, there were multiple scars on his abdomen indicating the many operations he has had. Cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal and neurological examination were unremarkable <heading>Analysis of history and examination Reasons for your choice of the cause of the patient's problem(s) and any other cause that still needs to be considered at this stage</heading>From the history and examination the most likely cause for this presentation is a cardiac cause; therefore, further investigations need to be carried out to look at possible cardiac pathology, such as brady or tachy arrhythmias. Reasons for the arrhythmia could be due to electrolyte imbalance and needs to be checked on blood tests. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>The patient feels very fit and well in spite of these two episodes of syncope. He is a very positive man, who feels that he has been 'blessed' after his close shave with death after the discovery of his GI cancer and subsequent remarkable recovery from this. He has a very supportive wife and family, all of which are strong Christians, which adds psychological help, as well as a good social community network. As he mentioned during the interview, his current problem of brady arrhythmia is an easy medical problem to rectify in comparison and coupled with his engineering ability to understand the general principles behind it, he has appeared to have reacted well to this most recent hospital admission. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management. Refer to the guidelines to the writing of portfolio cases for the details of the issues to be addressed under each heading.</heading><heading>Investigations</heading>A&E ECG showed 2:1 AV block with LBBB. Troponin levels on admission = <0.01 CXR = NAD Blood results pre-op: HGB = 15.4, WBC = 5.72, PLT = 163, Na+ = 143, K+ = 4, Urea = 7, Creatinine = 104 : DDD pacemaker inserted with vancomycin cover. The patient went into AF during the operation. This meant that the ventricular pacemaker could be properly tested, while the atrial pacemaker could not. Good anatomical positions were achieved with both leads. As the AF was witnessed and the patient has no previous history of AF he was DC cardioverted the same day before any clot formation could occur. The DC cardioversion was 150 joules biphasic machine and was successful. Plan - to carry out a 12 lead ECG 12 hours post cardioversion pre-discharge. <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading>The reasons for his two episodes of syncope were explained to Mr  as well as what was needed to be done to rectify the matter. He was given the relevant literature [1] and opportunities to ask any questions. During the insertion of the pacemaker, Mr  continually spoke with the registrar regarding the procedure. <heading>Prescription/medical intervention:</heading>Mr  was a well man apart from the 2:1 heart block. He needs no long-term medication; during his stay he needed to have specific pre- and post-operative prophylactic antibiotic cover. <heading>Observation</heading>Mr  was kept on the CCU wired to a 24 hour ECG pre- and 24 hours post- pacemaker insertion. <heading>Referral and team working</heading>A&E staff, Consultant Cardiologist and team, nurses, HCAs, radiographers, anaesthetist, catheter lab staff, surgical day-unit staff. <heading>Advice and prevention</heading>Mr  was told that he needed to go and check-in with his own GP when he arrived home. He was advised not to drive for one week post pacemaker insertion. A referral letter was sent to his nearest general hospital in  where he will be followed-up by a cardiology team and his pacemaker will now be routinely checked to ensure it is working to its maximum capabilities. <heading>Outcome A description of the progress of the patient as far as possible. This should include consideration of further issues to be resolved. Where appropriate you should contact by telephone patients who have been discharged home.</heading>Mr  was discharged on the , 24 hours post cardioversion and pacemaker insertion. <heading>Evidence based care and issues for research A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s)</heading>There is little evidence for cardiac pacemakers for bradyarrhythmias, however, there has been quite a lot of work looking at ICDs for tachyarrhythmias, which will be what this evidence-based section will look at. Cardiac resynchronisation with specialised left ventricular leads has been shown to reduce symptoms and improve survival in patients with symptomatic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and widened QRS complexes [2]. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator has become the standard therapy for protecting patients against sudden cardiac death. There have been two recent trials, Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Trial II (MADIT II) [3] and the Sudden Cardiac Death Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HEFT) [4]. To be continued... <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>There are three different types of second-degree heart block: Mobitz Type I or Wenckebach phenomenon. This is when there is progressive PR interval prolongation until a P wave fails to conduct. This process then starts again and is due to block in the AV node Mobitz Type II occurs when a dropped QRS complex is not preceded by progressive PR interval prolongation. This type of block indicates conduction problems at the infranodal level (His bundle) and carries a greater risk of the heart progressing to complete heart block. 2:1 or 3:1 block occurs when every second or third P wave conducts to the ventricles (always in a fixed ratio). [5] Permanent pacemakers are implanted in the body subcutaneously in front of the pectoral muscle. They are powered by a solid-state lithium battery, which usually last 5 - 10 years. Pacemakers can be programmed remotely by transmitting electromagnetic signals through the skin to the pacemaker. There are three letters to the different pacemakers, each letter indicates a different function/location: First letter (A/V/D) indicates which chamber it is pacing Second letter (A/V/D) indicates which chamber it is sensing Third letter (D/I) indicates whether it is inhibitory or not. Therefore, a DDD is a dual chamber (paces atria and ventricle), dual sensing and reacts in two ways (double) - pacing in the same chamber is inhibited by spontaneous atrial and ventricular signals, and ventricular pacing is triggered by spontaneous atrial events [6]. There are a number of complications, these are: Infection. If the pacemaker system is infected, antibiotic treatment is ineffective and the pacemaker often needs to be removed to treat the infection before another pacemaker is inserted. Erosion. The pacemaker can erode through the skin, due to a low-grade infection and/or mechanical factors. Pocket haematoma. Bleeding into the pacemaker pocket may result in significant pain, swelling and can cause wound breakdown. Warfarin is stopped prior to implantation and INR needs to be less than1.5. Lead displacement. Often an early complication, a CXR is taken prior to discharge to check the placement of the lead [7]. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading>Brady arrthymias, what to look for on history and examination.
