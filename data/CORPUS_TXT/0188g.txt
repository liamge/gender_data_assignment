In the gas phase there is nothing to stabilise this polarity, and thus the least polar of the two tautomers is the most stable. This is shown experimentally and in from theoretical calculations. Once entering solution, the molecules can interact with solvent molecules to help to stabilise these "partial charges" or the polarity of the molecules. The least polar of the two tautomers is affected least by this, and thus the stability of the two tautomers swaps. This is true in both cyclohexane and acetonitrile, a non-polar and polar solvent respectively. By increasing the polarity of the solvent, increases the difference in energy due to the extra stabilisation afforded to the more polar molecule (2-pyridone). These calculations cannot be directly compared to experimental values, since the experimental values are for Gibbs Free Energy (which also includes an entropy term). However they provide a qualitative comparison which shows the correlation is correct, and agrees with my reasoning for the observed effect of solvent on tautomers. <table/>The sources of error underlying computational calculations are 1) the level of theory used (high level meaning it has few or very good approximations, and low level meaning it has many or not very good approximations), 2) The basis set used for geometry optimisation and energy calculation, 3) The geometry optimisation (dependant upon the level of theory used and basis set). Here a high level of theory has been used, with relatively large basis sets, also the geometry was optimised at a good level also. However the solvent is modelled as a constant dielectric, which in reality is unrealistic, and more statistical methods such as Monte-Carlo, could be employed to model such systems in a more realistic manner. <heading>Mini Project 3: Rotation Barrier For Glyoxal</heading>All geometries and energies were optimised and calculated at B3LYP/6-31G: <heading>Cis-Glyoxal</heading><table/>Optimised structures are only at a true minima when all vibrational frequencies are real and positive- here this is true and thus it is at a true energy minima.

Interconversion between isomers seems more likely at room-temperature with MP2 SPE calculations than B3YLP ones since both cis->trans and trans->cis barriers are lower by 56% and 9% respectively. The only energy provided to the molecules to interconvert = kT (where k is the bolztmann constant and T is the temperature). At 298K this is = 1.3806505x10 −23 x 298/1000 x 6.022x10 23 mol -1 = 2.49 kJ mol -1. Thus even with the lower barriers at MP2 level, it shows that interconversion does not occur without an external energy source. <heading>Discussion of Results</heading><heading>Relative Energies</heading><table/>The relative energies of the two isomers is calculated to be closer to the experimental value in the MP2 SPE calculation (within 2.8%), than the B3LYP calculation (within 8.9%). <heading>Boltzmann Distribution Estimation of Equilibrium Population of trans/cis</heading> FORMULA  Where Ni/ Nj is the ratio of equilibrium population of the two isomers, and gi and gj their respective degeneracies (here both =1). R is the molar gas constant= 8.314 J K -1, Temperature is 298K and ΔE = 19.39 kJ mol -1 (MP2 calculation)- the difference in potential energies between the two isomers.  FORMULA   FORMULA  Thus the ratio of trans to cis at room temperature is estimated to be: 1:0.000399 i.e. for almost 2500 trans isomers there is one cis at room temperature. <heading>Barriers to isomer conversion</heading><table/>In both barriers the SPE MP2 calculation outperforms the B3LYP calculations when compared to experiment. On average MP2 is within 2-30% of experimental values, and the B3YLP are within 30-190% of experimental values. <heading>Dihedral Angle</heading><table/>Compared to experiment the dihedral calculated at B3LYP level is around 30° out. The sources of error underlying computational calculations are 1) the level of theory used (high level meaning it has few or very good approximations, and low level meaning it has many or not very good approximations), 2) The basis set used for geometry optimisation and energy calculation, 3) The geometry optimisation (dependant upon the level of theory used and basis set). The SPE calculations performed a lot better than the pure B3LYP calculations. This is because it is a higher level of theory and the SPE used a large basis set. So here for the SPE calculation the main error is the geometry optimisation- which uses a small basis set and poorer level of theory than perhaps required for this type of calculation.
