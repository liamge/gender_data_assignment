<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>In this exercise our main purpose was to extract, purify and characterize eugenol. This was done by completing the following steps: <list>Steam distillation of eugenolRemoval of non-phenolic organic components by alkaline washing procedureCharacterisation of eugenol by a chemical test, by refractive index and by gas chromatography.</list><heading>METHOD</heading><figure/>The exercise was completed after closely following the instructions from the Laboratory handout without any alterations, except one. When using the gas chromatography technique, we changed the solvent from iso-hexane to hexane. <heading>RESULTS - CALCULATIONS</heading><heading>Steam Distillation</heading>Weight of the sample: 20.0069 g Liquid-liquid extraction and isolation: Initial weight of the 250 ml round bottomed flask: 86.525 g Final weight of the 250 ml round bottomed flask: 88.176 g Difference in weight: 1.651 g → in 20.0069 g of sample So in 100 g of sample, we have 8.25 g eugenol = 8.25% <heading>Confirmation of Eugenol structure and Assessment of Purity </heading><heading>a) Chemical test:</heading>We added 1 drop of product to 5 ml ethanolic ferric chloride solution (5%, m/v). We observed a change in colour to blue. <heading>b) Refractive Index:</heading><table/><heading>c) Infrared Spectrum:</heading>Below there is a typical infrared spectrum of Eugenol. <figure/>The infrared spectrums for the standard solution and for the sample are attached. You can clearly observe the peaks that are representative of the phenol structure. <table/>The characteristic features for the spectrum have been marked on the attached sheets. <heading>d) Gas Chromatography</heading>The results obtained when using the gas chromatography method are attached for both the standard solution and the sample. We only had one peak after the peak of the solvent so we can assume that the sample contains only Eugenol. We can also observe two peaks where the solvent peak should be and this can be contributed to the presence of another solvent such as water. The retention time (time elapsed between sample introduction and maximum of response) of the Eugenol standard was 6.137 while for the sample was 6.106. They are almost similar so we assume that our sample contains only Eugenol. We have only one peak so we don't have to calculate the percentage of Eugenol in our sample as we assume this is 100%. <heading>DISCUSSION</heading>An error that has altered our results when determining the percentage of Eugenol in the cloves is that from the 20.0069 g of sample that was weighed, a very small amount could not be transferred into the distillation flask. Therefore, the result obtained (8.25%) is lower than the real value for Eugenol in the sample. It is known that freshly dried cloves contain about 14% of Eugenol. Our result value was far smaller than that, and this can be contributed to the fact that the cloves were not freshly dried, and had probably lost some of their aromatic character (by exposure to air). As for the result for the Refractive Index, we have a decline from the result that was from the standard solution and this can be contributed to a possible uncompleted evaporation of solvent using the rotary evaporator. The index of refraction normally decreases as the temperature increases for a liquid. For many organic liquids the index of refraction decreases by approximately 0.0005 for every 1 °C increase in temperature. Common errors with refractometer measurements include failing to calibrate with distilled water and not making the necessary temperature corrections. The chemical Test confirmed that our product is a phenol. This was obvious from the blue color that was formed. The infrared spectrum confirmed the phenol structure, and the results from the gas chromatography have also confirmed that our sample is composed only by Eugenol. Limitations due to the uncertainty of the instruments also exist but we consider them as not significant when doing our calculations.
