Jessica is 14 and lives with her mum and sister, Emma who is 16. Jessica and Emma have always been close, and even more so when their parents separated two years ago. They always looked very similar, so much so that when they were younger people often mistook them for twins. But, these sisters were actually very different. But, Jessica feels that she is living in her sister's shadow and she no where near as good in any way. At school all of her male friends say how much they fancy Emma and other girls are jealous, secretly wanted to be her. Jessica wishes that she was as popular as her sister and secretly wanted to be her too. Jessica is much shorter than Emma was at that age and doesn't share the same sporty figure. Her skin is very pale and her hair has always been frizzy. Emma had always been good at every subject and is one of the best at sports in the school. Jessica is bright but has never excelled greatly in any subject area, and on the sports field is awkward and clumsy. Jessica often feels that her parents prefer Emma and feels jealous when they tell other people how well Emma is doing. Jessica has always tried to be like her sister, but wants to find some way of showing people that she is just as special. Emma is so confident and although Jessica is not shy, the confidence she shows is always part of an act that she puts on to hide her real feelings. One thing that Jessica does well in is drama. She hasn't auditioned before for any of the school productions because she had been too shy. However, in drama classes she finds that she is more confident and, in fact, very good. She been to see lots of shows before and had always dreamed secretly that she up on stage too. Jessica's parents do not consider drama to be a very good route to follow and insisted that she did not pursue the subject at GCSE. Jessica is desperate to find a way to prove how talented she is and show that there is something that she, and not Emma, is good at.
