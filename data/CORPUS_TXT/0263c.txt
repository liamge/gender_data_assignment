<heading>Question 1</heading>Normalised colour signals are given as  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . The system gamma value is given as  FORMULA  and display gamma value as  FORMULA . Luminosity coefficients are taken as  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . This allows corrected luminance values for each colour to be calculated as follows:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA . Transmitted luminance can then be calculated:  FORMULA . Colour difference signals are then:  FORMULA   FORMULA . The displayed luminance can also be calculated:  FORMULA  <heading>Question 2</heading>Consider the carrier signal as a signal of the form  FORMULA , where A0 is the carrier amplitude and (0 is the carrier frequency. The modulating signal can be considered in the form  FORMULA  where m is the modulation depth (the ratio of modulated amplitude to carrier amplitude) and (m is the modulating frequency. In order to modulate the carrier, these two signals are multiplied using an analogue multiplier as shown in the diagram below to produce a DSB/SC signal. <figure/>Values for variables are given as follows:  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  peak (half the 10V peak-to-peak value given) and  FORMULA  peak so  FORMULA . In DSB/SC, the carrier is suppressed therefore the amplitude at the carrier frequency is 0V. The RMS amplitude of the sidebands is given by  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . These will be at their maximum when  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  therefore substituting gives the RMS sideband amplitudes as  FORMULA . DSB/SC signals cannot normally be detected by simple AM detectors as no carrier frequency is present and the modulation data may be negative. In order to solve this problem, the carrier must be transmitted along with the signal, for example by adding a pilot tone to the transmitted signal; this will also introduce a DC component to the modulated signal thus solving the problem of the signal being negative. DSB/SC signals are normally detected by generating a carrier at the receiver, which is of exactly the correct frequency and exactly in phase with the original carrier, then multiplying the received signal by this carrier signal and low-pass filtering the result. <heading>Question 3</heading>The characteristics of the amplifiers are specified as:  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA .  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Overall noise figure of a cascaded amplifier system can be calculated using the following equation:  FORMULA  where Ga is the gain of the first filter in the system, Gb is the gain of the second filter, Gc is the gain of the third filter, and Fa - Fc are the noise figures of the respective filters. Hence in the case of filter 1 in first position (i.e.  FORMULA ), filter 2 in second position (i.e.  FORMULA ) and filter 3 in third position (i.e.  FORMULA ):  FORMULA . For an optimal noise figure, filters should generally be arranged with the smallest noise figure in first position and the largest in last position, as the first makes the largest contribution to the overall noise figure and the last makes the smallest contribution. With this rule, arranging the filters with filter 1 in position 1, filter 3 in position 2 and filter 2 in position 3 should produce the smallest overall noise figure. As there are only 5 possible permutations, it is possible to test them all to determine if this is indeed correct: 1.  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA :  FORMULA  * best 2.  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA :  FORMULA  3.  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA :  FORMULA  4.  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA :  FORMULA  5.  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA :  FORMULA  As predicted, the configuration with filter 1 in position 1, filter 3 in position 2 and filter 2 in position 3 produces the smallest overall noise figure. However the difference in noise figure between this configuration and the original configuration is very small.
