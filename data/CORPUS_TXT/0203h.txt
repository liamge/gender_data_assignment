The tingling and numbness started approximately 2 years ago in the right hand but was now also affecting the left hand.  also stated that she experiences a burning pain in both hands during the night which wakes her. The pain is worse in the right hand and is relieved by shaking the hand or daggling it out of the bed. The pain can radiate to the forearm but  does not like to take painkillers to relieve the pain. Over the past few months,  has experienced weakness in her right hand and has found difficulty grasping objects e.g. holding a book to read. Typing at work also aggravates the symptoms.  has suffered with occasional neck pain since she ruptured her acromioclavicular ligament in , but did not report any limitation in the range of neck movements. <heading>Past Medical History</heading><list><heading>Medical</heading>Rupture Acromioclavicular ligament 1992No asthmaNo anginaNo epilepsyNo DVT/PE</list><list><heading>Surgical</heading>Hysterectomy 1997Excision right volar ganglion</list><heading>Social History</heading> is an office worker who lives with her husband in .

The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading> displays the classic symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). The carpal tunnel is a narrow fibro-osseous canal bound by the carpal bones and superiorly the flexor retinaculum. The 'tunnel' contains the median nerve and the nine extrinsic flexors of the fingers and thumb with their synovial sheaths. The median nerve supplies motor innervation to the three muscles of the thenar eminence - Abductor Pollicis Brevis, Opponens Pollicis and Flexor Pollicis Brevis and the 1 st and 2 nd lumbricals. It also supplies sensory innervation to the thumb, medial three fingers and radial side of the ring finger. A sensory branch of the median nerve originates proximal to the carpal tunnel and provides sensation to the thenar eminence. In the normal carpal tunnel there is barely room for all of the tendons and the median nerve. If there is a decrease in the size of the canal or an increase in the volume of contents, structure will inevitably be compressed. In carpal tunnel syndrome, patients present with symptoms of tingling and numbness in the hand due to compression of the median nerve. Sensation is altered in the distribution of the median nerve (the thenar eminence is spared due to the sensory branch supplying this region originating proximal to the carpal tunnel). The ulnar nerve supplies the little finger and the lateral side of the ring finger and so sensation here should also be normal on examination. Specific tests for examination to support working diagnosis: Phalens Test: Hold the wrist fully flexed for a couple of minutes - sensory symptoms may be reproduced Tinnels Test: Percuss over the flexor retinaculum (median nerve) to elicit sensory symptoms Positive Pressure: Apply pressure to the midpoint of the Flexor Retinaculum to elicit sensory symptoms. Weakness of thumb abduction - due to loss of innervation to the Abductor Pollicis Brevis muscle <list><heading>Causes:</heading>Non specific tenosynovial proliferation (most common)PregnancyRheumatoid ArthritisArthritis (degenerative)Growth hormone abnormalities (acromegaly)Metabolic (hypothyroidism, gout)AlcoholismTumoursIdiopathicConnective Tissue Disorders</list>Differential diagnosis: Cervical Spondylosis - Compression of roots C6 and C7 can present with similar symptoms to those described in CTS. However, pain and paraesthesia at night are more commonly reported in CTS. Proximal Medial Nerve Compression - The median nerve can be compressed beneath one of several structures around the elbow e.g. bicipital aponeurosis. Symptoms are similar to those seen in CTS, however night pain is uncommon and pain in the forearm is common. On examination, Phalens test is negative and the pain can be elicited by resisting flexion of the elbow with the arm in supination (to tighten the biciptal aponeurosis). Nerve conduction studies are used to localize the level of the compression. Anterior Interosseous Nerve Syndrome - can be selectively compressed at the same sites as the proximal median nerve. Symptoms include motor weakness but no changes to sensation. The anterior interosseous nerve supplies flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), flexor pollicis longus (FPL) and pronator quadratus. On examination the patient is unable to make the 'ok' sign i.e. pinching with the thumb and index finger joints flexed, due to weakness of the FPL and FDP muscles. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading><heading>General Examination </heading>On examination  was sitting in the chair and looked comfortable and alert at rest.

The examination would support this as both Phalens and the pressure test were positive in the right hand. Sensation was intact bilaterally on each little finger indicating no ulnar nerve involvement. On examination the anterior interosseous nerve was also intact. No pain was elicited on resisted flexion of the elbow in supination indicating that the median nerve was not being compressed proximally. The positive family history of Rheumatoid Arthritis would support this as a possible cause for 's CTS. However,  had no other signs to support such a diagnosis. Another possible cause for s CTS would be inflammation of the flexor tendons/tenosynovial proliferation of the hand from overuse due to her occupation. There is no evidence of metabolic or connective tissue disorders from the history or examination as a possible cause. X-rays of the wrist may be implicated to discount a fracture, tumour or arthritis as possible causes of median nerve compression. Nerve Conduction studies can be used to localise the area of nerve compression and confirm the working diagnosis, they are based on 4 principal measurements: <list>The mean conduction velocity (motor and sensory)Distal motor latencySensory action potentialsMotor action potentials</list><heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>Physically -  is developing a physical disability due to her symptoms in that she is unable to grasp objects with her right dominant hand. The symptoms she experiences are also aggravated by movements she makes as part of her occupation i.e. typing. The symptoms are also affecting her ability to carry out many activities of daily living i.e. holding a brush, kettle Psychologically - Psychologically  is concerned about the progression of her symptoms and the fact that they are now affecting her work and many of the tasks she used to do around the home.  is keen to receive help for her treatment and was encouraged to hear that the pain she experience during the night is likely to be reduced by painkillers.

There are a number of tendons and nerves which pass from the arm through a small tunnel formed by the structures around your wrist and into the hand. If the tunnel is too small tendons and nerves are compressed producing the symptoms you are experiencing. There are many reasons why this can occur, including pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis. There are also a number of people who have symptoms for which a cause cannot be identified. Painkillers will help to relive the burning pain you experience during the night so do not be afraid to take these when the pain is severe. We can also refer you to the physiotherapists who can provide you with a splint to wear at night which may provide temporary relief. As your symptoms are quite severe and are affecting your activities at work I would like to offer a surgical solution to your problems. We can perform a small operation which can release the pressure in the tunnel and therefore stop the compression of the nerves and tendons. As your symptoms are most severe in your right hand, this would be the side that we would operate on initially. In the mean time I can ask your GP to prescribe some short-term medication which may provide temporary relief and enable you to continue with your work. Are there any questions? <heading>Prescription/medical intervention</heading>The aims of intervention are to improve symptoms and reduce the physical signs of carpal tunnel syndrome, to prevent progression of and loss of hand function secondary to carpal tunnel syndrome and to minimise loss of time from work. Non operative: Nocturnal hand splint to reduce flexion of the wrist. Short term Oral Prednisolone to try and reduce symptoms prior to surgery. Operative: Open Surgical Division of Flexor Retinaculum - incision kept to ulnar side of thenar crease to avoid accidental injury to the palmar cutaneous and thenar motor branches of median nerve.

Indeed in 1999, carpal tunnel syndrome ranked the highest in respect to number of days away from work amongst work place injuries in the United States [1]. Nocturnal wrist splints can be used to retain the hand in neutral alignment and prevent flexion of the wrist and therefore reduce symptoms. Evidence has shown that nocturnal splinting provides a significant improvement in symptoms compared to no treatment [2]. Due to the waiting list for operations such as Carpal Tunnel release, many patients require interim treatment to enable them to continue with their occupational duties. Oral Prednisolone has been shown to significantly improve symptoms over a short time period i.e. 2- 4weeks compared to placebo [3]. However, oral prednisolone should only be prescribed as an interim intervention due to the side effects produced by corticosteroids e.g. osteoporosis, cushings syndrome. Corticosteroid injections are thought to relieve symptoms over a longer time period compared to oral corticosteroids although the duration of benefit requires further research [6]. For patients with severe symptoms, surgery is the most effective treatment option for relieving symptoms [4]. There are now 2 surgical options for release of the flexor retinaculum - open or endoscopic. <list><heading>Complications of open release are: </heading>painful hypertrophic scarreflex sympathetic dystrophyprolonged wound secretionwound infectionscar tethering and hypertrophyloss of strength and swollen/stiff fingers [5] </list><list><heading>Complications of endoscopic release include: </heading>partial transection of superficial palmar archdigital nerve contusionconversion to the open procedureulnar nerve paraesthesia, incomplete releaseincreased numbness in fingertipsloss of strength and mobility in wrist [5] </list>One RCT found that endoscopic carpal tunnel release was marginally more effective than open surgery in terms of functional status [8]. However the same article also concluded that endoscopic release was significantly more expensive than open surgical release [8]. Endoscopic release may therefore be less cost effective when compared to open surgical treatment. Evidence shows that 34% of patient with idiopathic CTS had complete resolution of symptoms within 6 months of diagnosis [7]. Surgical intervention is therefore unnecessary in this group of individuals. Further research is warranted into the relative contributions of non-surgical forms of treatment and their duration of benefit. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome has been accepted as the most common entrapment neuropathy. The condition does not follow a predictable course. Some patients experience deterioration in hand function with both motor and sensory effects whilst others describe silent periods and intermittent exacerbations of symptoms. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome has an important economic impact affecting active working people, most commonly females. It may occur as a work related disorder leading to compensation claims and so effective treatment is vital. Although complication rates from surgery are low, the effects of permanent weakness in the muscles of the thenar eminence may affect patients ability to continue with their occupation (which may be the case for ). Therefore it is important to discuss the risks of the operation with the patient as resolution of symptoms may occur over time without intervention. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading><list>Symptoms of CTSSpecific tests - Phalens, Tinnels, Positive pressureNerve Conduction Studies Management of CTS</list>
