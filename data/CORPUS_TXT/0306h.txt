Introduction </heading>The Michelson Interferometer, shown in Figure 1, is commonly regarded as one of the most significant pieces of scientific apparatus of the last century. Whilst it has lead to great discoveries in many fields, most famously in relativity, here it has been used to study the spectra of a variety of light sources and the refractive indices of various gases [1]. <picture/>The Michelson Interferometer, shown schematically in Figure 1, works by splitting light in two (by amplitude [2]) using a glass block known as the Beam Splitter (B), silvered on the side furthest from the light source, and recombining the light after both arms have reflected normally off mirrors (M1 and M2) to form an interference pattern that can be recorded by the detector. If necessary light entering B can be focussed to infinity and light reaching the detector can be focussed to as sharp a point as possible using lenses as in Figure 1. M1 can be moved towards or away from B using a geared micrometer operated by a motor. The horizontal and vertical tilt of M2 can be controlled using screws. The beam of light travelling towards M2 passes through a Compensation Plate (C), a block of glass of the same optical thickness as B, such that upon recombination at B both beams have travelled the same optical distance for optimum interference. The detector is a photo-detector of variable gain, detecting photo intensity, linked via an ADC to a computer. <heading>2. Background Theory</heading><heading>2.1 Circular Fringes</heading>If we assume that the distances  FORMULA , then we will observe interference maxima (fringes, shown in Figure 2) satisfying ;  FORMULA (1)[2,3], where  FORMULA  is the angle at which the fringe appears,  FORMULA  is the wavelength of the light and  FORMULA  is the order of the fringe. The resulting fringes will be circular (as  FORMULA  is constant for a given m,  FORMULA  and d) and centred on  FORMULA  where  FORMULA . The intensity of the rings is given by:  FORMULA (2)[2], where  FORMULA  is the amplitude of the waves being combined, and their phase difference is given by:  FORMULA  (3)[2]. The rings will appear to move out from, or in towards, the centre point as the micrometer position is varied. Thus one can observe the variation of intensity of the centre point as a function of d (this will be used in the subsequent sections, see Figure 4). <heading>2.2 Localized Fringes </heading>Consider a case similar to that discussed in 2.1 but now with M 2 tilted slightly. The geometry can be simplified by superimposing M2' onto M1 (see Figure 2). Collimated light propagates from point P and the two rays reaching the observer (looking parallel at M1) appear to diverge from point P'. The position of P' varies with the angle of the incident light (i.e. position of P) however, importantly, it has been proven that the path difference between ray 1 and 2 does not [4]. <figure/>By considering light incident on M2 it becomes clear that the extra distance travelled is due to an "air film" in the shape of a wedge (see Figure 3). This extra distance is constant parallel to the edge of the wedge. Where the distance between M1 and M2 is small the thickness of the wedge can be approximated as the half the path difference (points A, B, B and D correspond to constructive interference). It is easy to show that the separation, l, between adjacent maxima  FORMULA  (4) where φ is the wedge angle (φ is small). This gives vertical localised fringes in the field of view. However, because of some variation of path difference with angle, these approximations only hold when the distance between M1 and M2 is small. Thus in general the fringes are usually curved and are always convex towards the thin end of the wedge. These localized fringes are known as "Fizeau's wedge fringes" [2][6][5]. <picture/><heading>2.3 Coherence length</heading>An important parameter of any light source used in this experiment is coherence length because it is a measure of the length of an emitted wave-train before it breaks down. The Coherence length of a single spectral line or band can be found from bandwidth  FORMULA  (5) where Δtc is the coherent time. From equation (5) it is obvious that the coherence length is given by  FORMULA  (6)[2 p.650] <heading>3 Results </heading><heading>3.1Calibration Using He-Ne Laser </heading>A He-Ne laser was used to determine the ratio of movement of M1 to a given movement of the micrometer. The laser was aligned such that fringes were observed and the motor was left running so that the micrometer moved through 2.20mm, as it did so the intensity recorded by the detector varied sinusoidally as one would expect from equation (1). In that time 1454 fringes were observed by the detector corresponding to a movement of  FORMULA  of M1 (given by  FORMULA , where  FORMULA ). From this a ratio of  FORMULA  was found (movement of M1: movement of micrometer). The laser was also used to align the interferometer in subsequent experiments due to its long coherence length. <heading>3.2 Interference of Sodium light </heading>Sodium light is known to consist of two main wavelengths, rather than one as with a laser. Because of this the intensity of the bright fringes was observed to vary as a function of d, as the two wavelengths interfered constructively and destructively with each other. From equations (2) and (3) we can see that maximum intensity will occur at  FORMULA . Since this point is very hard to locate the sodium spectrum (I as a function of micrometer reading) was recorded for a large sweep of the micrometer, shown in Figure 4. It was noted that wave packets formed at regular intervals, increasing in peak intensity as they approached the largest wave packet, where  FORMULA , clearly visible in Figure 4 and marked by the pink dashed line. From this graph it was found that  FORMULA  at a micrometer reading of  FORMULA . The interference pattern of Sodium light is shown in Figure 5. Consider the position of M1 when the two wavelengths (λ1 > λ2) that make up the spectrum of sodium are out of phase.  FORMULA  where n is an integer. The extra half wavelength is required for destructive interference. Next M1 is moved to the next destructive interference of λ1 and λ2 (i.e. the next minima in the wave packet). <figure/> FORMULA <picture/> FORMULA  From these equations it can be shown that the difference between the two wavelengths in the sodium doublet can be calculated from the separation, s, between destructive (or constructive) interferences (equation (7)).  FORMULA  (7) λav is the mean wavelength of sodium light = 589.3nm [7].It was found that  FORMULA . <heading>3.3 White-light interference</heading><heading>3.3.1 Theory of White-light interference</heading>White-light contains a continuous spread of wavelengths from 400 to 750nm and consequently has a very short coherence length (see equation (6)). Using equation (1) for constructive interference and equation (1) where  FORMULA  for destructive interference, consider a white light source with d = 1000nm. Assuming θ is small, light with wavelength 667nm, 500nm and 400nm will interfere constructively and light with wavelength 571nm, 444nm will interfere destructively and consequently no fringe pattern will be observed. White-light interference will only be observable where d is very close to 0, the position of zero path difference. In order to achieve zero path difference M2 must be tilted as with localised fringes. Let us again consider a system where M2 is replaced by its virtual image M2' formed by a reflection along the line of beam splitter B (see Figure 6). The position of zero path difference can be found at the point where M2' intersects M1. The white-light fringes were expected to be vertically aligned because the path difference, d, is very small (see section 2.2) [2]. <figure/><heading>3.3.2 Observation of coloured fringes</heading>The equipment was set up as in Figure 1 with a white-light source positioned a distance of the focal length away from the convex lens, focusing it into a parallel beam, with M1 at the position of zero optical path difference (calculated in the sodium section) and M2 slightly angled as with localised fringes. The focusing lens was removed so the fringes could be observed by eye. The field of view contained vertically aligned fringes; a central black fringe surrounded by coloured fringes fading with distance from the centre (Figure 7). The number of fringes in the field of view increased with increase in the angle of M2, (φ). <picture/><heading>3.3.3 Explanation of spectrum separation</heading>At first it seems a little confusing that the central fringe is black since it appears that, for any wavelength of light, the two beams should be in phase with each other. This is due to the paths taken by ray 1 and 2 respectively. Ray 1 undergoes an internal reflection at B with no associated phase change whereas ray 2 undergoes an external reflection and consequently a phase change of π. Therefore at zero path difference and θ = 0 there is destructive interference. Either side of the central fringe, fringe separation is increased for longer wavelengths due to "Fizeau's wedge" (equation (4)) and hence the colours appear to separate (illustrated in Figure 8 for wavelengths corresponding to green and red). This separation produces the various impure spectral colours observed. Eventually, so many colours are present at a particular point that the resultant colour appears white. This limits the number of fringes visible [2]. As φ increases the separation decreases (from equation (4)) so more fringes become visible in the field of view. <figure/><heading>3.3.4 Dispersion</heading>The compensation plate C in the Michelson Interferometer plays a vital role in white-light interference. It is required because light reflects off the back surface of the beam splitter mirror B. This means that light reflected by M1 travels through B three times whereas light reflected by M2 only travels through B once. B has a higher refractive index than air, consequently the light that travels through it is slowed ( FORMULA ). For a monochromatic light source this is the only consideration and without C the distance to M1 appears longer. However, for a light source comprising of different constituent wavelengths, or indeed a continuum as in the case of white-light, the effect of dispersion must be considered. The different wavelengths of white-light experience different refractive indices in B, meaning that light of shorter wavelength is slowed more than light of longer wavelength (as with light in a prism). Without C, M1 could be moved to give equal path for say green light, but now the paths would no longer be equal for red or blue light. With the introduction of C rays 1 and 2 travel through the same amount of material B, have equal dispersion, and therefore equal path for all wavelengths [5]. <heading>3.3.5 Coherence Length of White-light </heading>The motor for driving M1 was run whilst the intensity of white-light was measured as a function of distance using the photodiode. The coherence length was found to be  FORMULA  from Figure 9. It is unsurprising that this is small because of the continuous range of interfering frequencies in the white-light spectrum (see equation (6)). <figure/><heading>3.4 Mercury fringes</heading>The equipment was set up as for white-light, using a Mercury lamp, and Mercury fringes were observed (see Figure 10). By the repetitiveness of the spectrum, it is evident that the emission spectrum of Mercury contains a number of spectral lines rather than the continuous spectrum seen with white-light. <picture/><heading>3.4.1 Coherence length of Mercury</heading>As in section 3.2, intensity was recorded as a function of micrometer reading using the photodiode. The beat pattern observed was longer than the total adjustable length of M1 and therefore the coherence length could not be measured directly. The coherence length of the individual spectral lines was calculated from the emission spectrum (equation (6)). This was done by a Fourier analysis of the recorded intensity verses extension data. Consider equation (8) for two waves of equal amplitude, the contribution to intensity for a small increment in wavenumber k can be written as:  FORMULA  (8) where the extension x = 2 d and consequently kx = δ and S(k) is the wavenumber spectrum of the source. By integration it can be shown that:[6 p.17]  FORMULA  where  FORMULA . Now by taking the real (cosine) part of the Fourier transform of intensity the observed wavenumber spectrum of the sample can be found.  FORMULA  The computer performed the Fourier transform on this data to produce a graph of k space (Figure 11). For each λ in the emission spectrum the intensity varies sinusoidally with extension, resulting in a Fourier transform that is symmetrical about is centre. <figure/>Using data shown in Figure 12, which is colour coded to correspond to Figure 11, the relative abundances of the measured spectral frequencies can be found. The low signal to noise ratio in Figure 11 means that the information displayed is not of a high enough degree of accuracy for any calculations of coherence length to be made. However, this does at least offer an insight into how this method can be used, and had the data been recorded over a larger range of micrometer readings the signal to noise ratio could have been improved. The anomalous peak, which precedes the yellow peak, is in fact in the infrared range and the data quoted is only for the visible spectrum. <table/><heading>3.5 Calculating the Refractive Indices of gases</heading>The refractive index of a material is defined as  FORMULA  where  FORMULA  is the speed of light in a vacuum, and  FORMULA  is the speed of light within that medium. In order to determine the refractive indices of various gases the Helium-Neon laser was, once again, mounted upon the interferometer apparatus and a gas cell of length  FORMULA  was placed in between the beam splitter (B) and the mirror M1. The cell, as shown in Figure 13, could be filled with the different gases that were stored within a gas bladder and releasing the appropriate valves. The length of the gas cell disregarding the length of glass either end was taken to be 40.57 mm and a pressure gauge was attached to the cell so the pressure could be determined at any given time. <picture/>When the gas cell is evacuated the laser light travels through the cell at  FORMULA  with frequency  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  of  FORMULA . At this time, the cell length  FORMULA  will hold  FORMULA  wavelengths. The frequency of the laser light is directly associated with the energy of the photons produced by the laser FORMULA  and will remain constant at all times. As a gas of refractive index n is introduced into the cell at a steady rate, the speed with which the laser light propagates will vary as the pressure within the chamber changes. Using  FORMULA , and by equating  FORMULA  here to that above we can show that :  FORMULA  (9) This shows that as the pressure in the chamber is increased to atmospheric pressure  FORMULA  the wavelength of light in the gas cell  FORMULA ) has been reduced by a factor of  FORMULA . As the wavelength during this time is effectively shorter, the length of the cell will hold  FORMULA  more wavelengths of light, i.e.  FORMULA [8]. By equating  FORMULA  when empty and during the pressure change and also taking into account that the laser passes through the gas cell twice (once towards M1 and again towards the beam splitter (B)) we get :  FORMULA  (10)[7] The difference in wavelengths between the beam that reflects from M2 and the beam that passes through the gas cell causes a path difference, and hence we will see  FORMULA  fringes as the gas is allowed into the chamber. Therefore, by counting the fringes that occur whilst the cell is being filled, we will be able to determine n for various gases ( FORMULA  results are displayed to show the values more clearly in standard form). <table/> FORMULA  FORMULA As the wavelength of the laser light in a vacuum and the length of the gas cell were quoted on the apparatus to a high degree of accuracy, we assumed negligible error in these measurements, and that the error originated from the counting of the fringes  FORMULA . We assumed each measurement followed Poisson statistics and the error was averaged over three repeats. Most of the indices calculated were just within the boundary of experimental error with respect to the quoted values. The values were systematically higher than those expected, suggesting that we recorded a slower laser light speed within the cell. This could be because the value of L was quoted as too small, or from simply counting too many fringes.
