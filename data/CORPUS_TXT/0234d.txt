<abstract><heading>Abstract</heading>This report is aimed to design a torque sensor measurement system. This would include from selection of strain gauges i.e. 5mm steel to derivation of formulas. This measurement system is divided into four blocks as each of them has its own specific task and is believed that such separation would enable the system to work more efficiently. Torque is measured on the shaft by a torque sensor and signal is then produced by a Wheatstone Bridge Circuit which is then followed by signal processing with the use of a amplifier and low pass filter so that signal is in a suitable form to be displayed and can be easily identified on a signal presentation unit. An accurate torque measurement system must be calibrated to produce accurate results and can either be done by self-calibration in digital signal or zeroisation in signal of analogue form. Sensor capability and suggested method to check if the torque sensor is insensitive to other physical changes is also discussed. </abstract><heading>Background Theory/ Glossary</heading>Torsion: is a twisting strain produced when a torque is applied to an object. For example, torsion is the strain experienced by a length of wire when a twisting force is applied to one end while the other end is fixed. It can be measured by observing how much an object twists due to a given torque. When a cylindrical object one unit long is twisted at one end, and the other end is held fixed, the amount the ends of the cylinder rotate relative to each other is a measure of the torsion. Shear stress: A stress often represented by τ in which the top and bottom of a material are pushed in opposite horizontal directions and it can be defined as  FORMULA  Shear Strain: The amount of deformation by shearing, in which parallel lines slide past each other in a certain degree. The measurement is expressed as the tangent of the change in angle between lines that were initially perpendicular. It is often known as angle distortion and represented by γ. It can be found by  FORMULA  . Shear modulus: An elastic constant for the ratio of shear stress to shear strain. The shear modulus is often represented by letter G. It can be defined as follows:  FORMULA  <picture/>General torsion equation is given by:  FORMULA  Transducers: are designed to measure force, torque, moment or pressure mostly, using inexpensive, easy to install, strain gauges to provide an output signal (voltage) which then can be processed to give relative measurement readings easily. To measure torque, the kind of transducer needed is a torque sensor. <heading>Design</heading>In general, a given measurement system can be divided into four elements and each of the element is responsible for a certain task. From design point of view, it would be more efficient to concentrate design one element at one time without worrying about the others. The element flow chart is shown below <figure/>Sensing element: This is an element that measure physical process and gives an either mechanical or electrical output. Signal conditioning element: This element converts output of sensing element into a more suitable form for further processing. It usually involves converting mechanical output from sensing element to an electrical signal. Signal processing element: This element is responsible for signal processing and often involves amplification of signal, error compensation, convert analogue signal to digital form if necessary, etc. Signal presentation element: This presents the final measured output value in a form that can be easily recognised. Display units from a pointer-scale indicator (analogue) to computer (analogue/digital) all belong to this family. <heading>Sensing element</heading><heading>System</heading>The fundamental concept of this design is that a torque applied to a shaft produces twisting which results in shear stresses in the shaft. And a torque can be applied via a thin steel bar clamped to the free end of the shaft while weight is applied at the other end of the steel bar. A simple set up of this could look like below: <picture/>As seen above, weight on shaft B causes a deflection which would then be transferred to shaft A by the clamp. Since the clamp makes an angle with the shaft A, twisting force is produced. <heading>Sensing unit</heading>In order to obtain the values of torque produced on the shaft, torque sensors, often known as torque cells, could be used. They are transducers that convert an applied torque to an electrical output signal. Torque is measured on a rotating shaft with the use of torque sensors, which would produce an output signal. <heading>Torque cells</heading><picture/>They are made up of a mechanical element (usually a shaft with a circular cross section) and a sensor (usually electrical resistance strain gauges). The four strain gauges mounted on the shaft at two perpendicular 45 degree helices that are diametrically opposite one another. Positive strain can be sensed by gauges 1 and 3, mounted on the right hand (or upper) helix while gauges 2 and 4, mounted on the left hand (or lower) helix sense negative strain. This arrangement of the strain gauges on the surface of the shaft defines the principal stress and strain direction for a circular shaft subjected to pure torsion. Selection: 5mm steel gauges are selected to use in the torque sensor because They are cheaper than 2mm ones as it does not require very precise equipment to manufacture them. The length of the shaft allows more than enough space for allocation of the strain gauges as they would take no more than 10mm to fit while the shaft is 100mm long Steel gauges would be used as they have the same linear expansion as the shaft. This is important as aluminium would have different linear expansion and thus gives out different strain, resistance <heading>Signal conditioning element</heading><heading>Bridge Circuit </heading><picture/>The Wheatstone Bridge Circuit is commonly used to convert a change in resistance to an output voltage. The idea behind the circuit is to adjust the resistance of one of the resistors (i.e. i.e. one of them is a variable resistor) until the measured voltage across the centre is zero. At that point, the bridge is balanced. Selection: 9V is supplied to the circuit as this would give out a low accurate output signal <heading>Derivation of the relationships between</heading><heading>(a) the shear stress and the torque</heading>Given that the 200mm long shaft is hollow with an outside diameter of 20mm and internal diameter of 18mm Let J be the polar second moment of area D be the diameter of the shaft τ be the shear stress T be the torsion E be the Young Modulus σ(1) be the stress (experienced by strain gauge 1) τ(xz) be the shear stress (in x and z direction) ε be the strain v be the Poisson's ratio R be the resistance of the strain gauge and ∆R be the change of resistance of the strain gauge due to torsion V,e be the potential difference S g be the gauge factor The polar second moment of area =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  The diameter of the shaft in m = (20-18) / 1000 = 2e-3 m Since τxz = T D / 2 J τxz = T (2e-3) / 2 (5.4e-9) τxz = T (1.852e5) (QED) <heading>(b) the strain and the shear stress</heading>Since the normal stresses in x, y, z direction is 0 for a circular shaft subjected to pure torsion,  FORMULA  Therefore, strain on gauge 1 and 2 could be found out by combining the equation above with the linear elasticity rule. Thus,  FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>(c) The resistance and strain for each strain gauge</heading>A strain gauge exhibits a resistance change ∆R / R that is related to the strain in the direction of the grid by the expression below:  FORMULA  The response of the strain gauges to strain can be obtained by combining the equation above with the result of (b), which would give  FORMULA  <heading>(d) the bridge output and the torque</heading>As the strain gauges are connected into a Wheatstone bridge, which has been shown earlier, the relationships between output voltage and T could be obtained by the result of (c) into  FORMULA  then we will have  FORMULA  <heading>Signal processing element</heading>Signal conditioning element gives out signal in a form of electrical voltage and processing is needed before being displayed. The followings are the most usual process: <heading>Amplification</heading>The output signal of the bridge circuit is often too low in terms of voltage and this requires a suitable amplifier to give an appropriate voltage level that can be recognised by other specimen. Below is the amplifier of this newly designed measurement system. <picture/>This is a non-inverting amplifier and is selected because both the input and output signals of this circuit are of the same polarity and magnitude of magnification can easily be adjusted by changing the resistors. The gain of this amplifier is given by:  FORMULA  Selection: Use a combination of resistors which would give a gain of 1000, which should be sufficient to amplify a weak signal into a recognisable form. <heading>Error compensation</heading>Errors vary in an unpredictable way and thus very hard to correct. Even so, it is possible to minimise their effect. In an electronic circuit, the most likely error is caused by electrical and electronic noises. This considerable amount of noise in the output is due to considerable gain used. This should be filtered by a low pass filter, which is made of a capacitor across a feedback resistor of the amplifier. Depending on how much noise and how efficient the amplified is wanted to be, to have; a compromise has to be made. This is directly affected by the value of capacitor used. Equation below shows how a capacitor could influence and thus a suitable value of capacitor used can be found out. Let frequency be F period be T resistance be R Since  FORMULA  Substituting above to  FORMULA  which would give  FORMULA  Rearranging  FORMULA  Selection: Since R (resistance of the feedback resistor) is known after how much of gain has been decided, the value of capacitor used can be decided by considering the range of frequency to be filtered out with the used of the equation above. Any noise below 10Hz should be filtered <heading>Signal presentation element </heading>Signals can be classified as either analogue or digital and data presentation for each of them is different from the other. Below will discuss both analogue and digital presentation. <heading>Analogue</heading>The torque measurement system is tested and calibration is made manually. 1. This can be done by zeroing the system when the clamp is taken off and both shafts are not in contact with each other i.e. no torsion. 2. Then connect the system as shown in diagram 2 and start putting standard weights on shaft B progressively 3. Results are taken from the output of the amplifier. 4. A graph of the system output against torsion can then be plotted by using the general torsion equation to find out torsion applied on shaft A by B. 5. Make a linear fitting of the data with suitable program (e.g. Matlab, Excel) 6. Finally determine the linear range and sensitivity of the torque sensor system. <heading>Digital</heading>Most instruments nowadays are in digital format so it makes sense to digitise analogue signals into the digital form for further processing like linearization, self-calibration and most of all converting the electronic signal to its corresponding physical variable, which can be displayed with a large variety of digital devices. The simplest way to do would be connect the designed measurement system with a computer with the use of a special card, which is solely responsible for converting analogue signal into digital. The counter method of conversion is one of the simplest methods converting analogue signal to digital. It would be a good example explaining what actually goes on when data is being digitalised in the connection card. At the heart of the counter ADC (analogue-digital converter) is a DAC (digital-analogue converter) connected to the parallel outputs of an up counter. The DAC output is compared with the analogue input signal using a comparator. The output of the comparator generates a stop control for the counter. The counter is zeroed to start with and then the counter starts to count up when the output from the DAC is decreasing. When the DAC voltage reaches a point that is equal to the analogue input signal, the output from the comparator will change state, stopping the counter. This signal is also used to generate a 'conversion complete' control signal. At this stage the digital equivalent of the analogue input signal can be found by reading the parallel output from the counter. When external equipment (e.g. a computer) has finished reading this value, the counter is reset to zero and the whole process restarts. This method, of course, is not very efficient as this can only process one signal at one time and it takes a long time to find the right digital equivalent signal but it gives a general picture of how one of the simplest ADC works. The output digital signal could be transferred in to a computer, which could then display and interpret the data (e.g. self-calibration, etc) with the use of suitable softwares. Labview is one of the programs used in the university and it is very easy to use. 1. Connect the output of the designed torque sensor system to a data acquisition system which has an AD and DA card plugged into a PC 2. Run Labview 3. Calibrate the system with the program 4. Test the measurement system by putting loads on shaft B progressively 5. Save the result <heading>Discussion</heading><heading>Range</heading>The range of the measurement system can measure depends on the diameter of the shaft and the proportional limit Sτ of the material in torsion. Maximum torsion can be measured is given by  FORMULA  <heading>Resolution</heading>Resolution in an analogue instrument is limited by its noise level but in a digital instrument the resolution is represented by its least significant bit. For instance a the most common 12 bit Analogue-to-Digital converter has an input range of V in and its resolution is given by  FORMULA  <heading>Test</heading>All transducers exhibit a dual sensitivity to some degree, which means that the output voltage is the result of both a primary quantity, in this case torque, and a secondary quantity, such as temperature or secondary load (e.g. axial force, bending moment) To check if the design measurement system is insensitive to secondary quantity, It can be tested under: 1. a standard primary quantity i.e. constant torque 2. conditions of different secondary quantity (e.g. tested in different temperature, different axial force and bending moment) to see if there is any change under different secondary conditions. The arrangement of the bridge circuit compensates any variation caused by secondary quantity elements and therefore the torque sensor should be proved insensitive to uniform changes, axial force and bending force. <heading>Comments</heading>This design covers all the basic requirements needed in a torque measurement system. It is believed that this circuit can improve by using a Wheatstone Bridge constant current circuit as using constant current in a Wheatstone Bridge circuit
