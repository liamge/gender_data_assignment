<heading>Referral information</heading> was referred to the mental health services in  with a history of severe stomach cramps and a long history of problems with her eating habits and weight. This was the first time that  had felt ready to accept help for her eating behaviour. <heading>History</heading><heading>Presenting Complaint</heading> has continuous thoughts about food and what she is allowed and not allowed to eat.  believes she is fat and exercises excessively in order to maintain her weight, she has also been making herself sick after episodes of binge eating. <heading>History of Presenting Complaint </heading> has a long history of problems regarding her eating behaviours and weight.  is afraid of putting on weight and says that "she feels fat".  has not weighed herself since Christmas day when she weighed 58 kg (she is 1.7m in height), she says that she "daren't get on the scales as "I know I have put weight on".  says that "she feels and knows she looks good when her hip bones stick out" and she is aware of this when she weighs approx 9 stone 2-4 lb (58Kg).  plans her meals and portion size out the night before and states that she often feels hungry in the afternoons, a typical days intake at present would be: Breakfast - 2 scoops of porridge with water and a drop of skimmed milk Lunch - tin of tuna and a spoonful of rice Tea - small chicken portion and a portion of vegetables  is currently feeling anxious as she is in the process of selling her house and says that she has been feeling stressed over the past few weeks and waking during the night.  blamed this stress for her recent "naughty" behaviour in that she has been bingeing on "rubbish" food (black wine gums, chocolate biscuits and toast) and then making herself sick. This behaviour occurs approximately once a day (occasionally twice) on most days for the past 1-2 weeks either in the evening at home or at work.  feels that she is "struggling" with her eating habits at the moment, occasionally she feels "out of control" but that "on the whole it is ok".  is also exercising for approx. 1 Â½ hours a day, 6 days a week to "burn calories and fat, become leaner and more defined", and is taking training supplements (amino acids), multivitamins and stackers (which "lift" metabolism).  has a limited social life in the evening due to the time spent at the gym and does not like to eat in front of people. <heading>Past Psychiatric History</heading> vividly recalls "feeling fat" at the age of five. 12-15 From the age of 12  became vegetarian and started to avoid certain foods in order to decrease her weight and did this successfully until the age of 15. During this time,  recalls making herself sick on 2 occasions but said that this may have been because she didn't like the food she had eaten. From the age of 15 she ate mainly fruit during the day for a period of approx 6 months to 1 year and stated that eating made her feel sick. 16-17 At the age of 16-17  discovered laxatives and has been using these since (on and off) to help with weight loss. At one point,  was using approximately 18 laxatives a day and drinking lots of water to help "wash everything out of my system".  recalls having to run from the classroom to the bathroom to defecate whilst at College.  would wake at 6.00 in the morning and run for 3 miles before and after college, she would have an apple for breakfast, no food during the day and a slice of toast in the evening.  would weigh herself in the morning, afternoon and before bed but only after she had been to the toilet, had not had anything to eat or drink and was wearing no clothes. During this time she lost approximately 3 stone (19Kg) over a period of 9 months and her weight fell to 6 stone (38 Kg).  would also induce vomiting (approx. 3-4 times in 24 hours) a number of times during the week.  was aware that she had a problem at this stage but did not confide in anybody, she recalls felling very low and crying on the phone to her friend saying that she could not talk about it. In ,  was referred to the child psychologist by her teachers. This outraged  and she was determined that she didn't want help and told the psychologist a "bunch of lies" during the consultation: she felt that her mother resented her for being female as she wanted another boy after her brothers twin was stillborn she felt uncomfortable with her body image and hated wearing dresses sometimes she wished she was a boy her eating behaviours were a way of coping with all of these stresses. 17-20  was employed during this period and feels that her job weaned her off the laxatives as she had difficulty making it to the toilet in time. 's food intake also increased as she found she could not concentrate at work and consequently her weight increased. 20-25 During this period, 's weight fluctuated but her behaviour towards food was consistent.  would restrict her intake, binge and exercise but her use of laxatives reduced.  took up karate, became more involved in her exercising and joined the local gym, she also bought a house and her weight started to increase. At 23, 's eating behaviours relapsed and she stopped eating for a period of time.  would binge and purge a number of times during the week and lost approx 3 stone over a 1year period. At 25,  began working at the gym in the evenings twice a week, this introduced her to a new circle of friends and her social life improved. 's dietary intake was still restricted, she would exercise excessively but there was no bingeing or induced vomiting. 26 - 30 At the age of 27,  made a "conscious decision" to tell a doctor about her eating behaviour and accept help.  had been aware that she had a problem for some time but was not ready to accept help before this point. Over the last 4 years,  describes her eating behaviour as variable. 's mother suffered from depression and attempted to commit suicide by overdose several times following the separation from her husband. This annoyed  and she felt bitter towards her mother. <heading>Past Medical History</heading>1993/1994 - Jaundice, hair loss, skin changes; exacerbation of eczema, prolonged skin healing - at time when 's weight was at its lowest 2002 - Severe abdominal pain/cramps and bloating associated with induced vomiting, hole through nasal septum <heading>Family History</heading>'s mother is 54 years old and unemployed, her father is 57 years old and delivers goods for a living, they divorced when  was 21 and she feels that she coped well through this, her father is currently living with a partner.  described the marriage as initially being ok but said that her parents never really had much in common. The divorce came as a relief to  as it "stopped all the arguing".  has one older brother age 34 who works as a plumber, he had a twin brother who was stillborn. The relationship with her parents was described as being ok although  was closer to her father and her brother was closer to his mother.  described her mother as being short tempered and said that they would "rub each other up the wrong way". There is no history of abuse or neglect.  and her brother were brought up to be independent children and said that as they were growing up they never really had time for each other.  doesn't see her brother as much as she would like to but said that they keep in touch on the phone.  was unable to talk to her parents about her problems, her mother found out about her behaviour by accident when she caught her being sick. Prior to this there had been no comments about her weight or dietary habits. 's mother takes thyroxine for hypothyroidism. <heading>Personal History </heading><heading>Birth/Childhood</heading>There are no known pregnancy or birth problems,  weighed 7lb 8oz at birth.  achieved her reading, writing and talking milestones at an early age.  described her childhood as being 'good'. During her pre school years, she spent a lot of time in a male dominated environment, as most of the children her age were boys. 's mother was a volunteer at the nursery that she attended. <heading>Education</heading>At primary school she was keen on reading and had a good relationship with all of her teachers except one.  described herself as being fairly quiet but said that she had many friends. During High school,  had one best friend who she remained close to until they went to different colleges and "drifted" apart.  hated PE lessons but was keen on hockey and running.  described herself as being an average student who was "quite academic" and did a lot of studying.  left high school with good GCSE grades and attended King Edwards college and studied A levels in Maths, Biology and Chemistry. Unfortunately during this time, 's eating behaviours were "at their worse" and she failed to take her A level exams. <heading>Employment</heading> left college and worked as a clerical administrator at a local company in .  walked "13 miles" per day to work and eventually left in  to work as an accountant for Unichem. In , she was given a promotion which upset some of her colleagues. The relationship between them became "unbearable" and  left after 5 years. In  she was employed by the NHS as a Quality Improvement Facilitator within  PCT.  enjoys her work and has a good relationship with her colleagues, in  she completed a certificate in Management Practice at  College. <heading>Relationships/Sexual History</heading>'s first sexual relationship was with a good friend when she was 18 years old. The experience was "not great" and "just happened". At the age of 19 she had her first serious sexual relationship, which lasted for approximately 9 months.  described her former partner as being "rude" and stated that neither her brother nor father liked him. In ,  had a relationship with a male who she lived with for approx 18 months in a house that she bought. The relationship ended in  as  felt they had grown apart and were better as friends, her partner was never in and she became lonely.  admitted to having a brief affair with a neighbour approx 1 month before her partner moved out but justified this by saying that the relationship was over. 's father was angry at this decision and "told her off", her brother was also angry and told  to "sort yourself out you skinny bitch". After this,  had an on off relationship with a partner who "stressed her out". Her next relationship in  was not great, the partner was involved in drugs and  experimented with amphetamines during this time. The relationship ended in  to 's relief as she found him to be a source of constant criticism and irritation.  is happy in her current relationship and described it as being "great".  has no desire to have children and stated that the thought of it makes her "feel physically sick" and that she "can't even hold babies", although she did not discount the idea as a possibility for the future.  feels that her eating behaviours affect her relationships.  has never had any significant problems with her menstrual cycle, however, she finds that the week before her period she feels sick and her bingeing/purging behaviour tends to increase. <heading>Social History</heading> has recently moved into a house with her partner in .  has never smoked and rarely drinks alcohol, there is no current illicit drug use.  occasionally socialises with her friends from the gym. <heading>Systems Review</heading>CVS Palpitations RESP Nil GIT Constipation associated with induced vomiting GUT Nil CNS Headaches after she has been sick, dizziness, light headed and sudden weakness of legs when she has not eaten <heading>Forensic History</heading>Nil <heading>Pre-morbid personality</heading> described herself as being an anxious individual although she gets on well with people and is often referred to as being "bubbly".

Points to look for on physical examination would be: evidence of malnutrition - pale conjunctiva, dehydration effects of repeated vomiting e.g. loss of enamel, callus on hand from induced vomiting postural and resting blood pressure to indicate autonomic dysfunction and dehydration presence of laguno hair, loss of head hair and dry skin myopathy (however this is unlikely in s case due to her exercise and weight training) <heading>Analysis of history and examination</heading>From the history and mental state examination  is a 30-year-old lady who is currently presenting with a diagnosis of an Eating Disorder F50. The most likely diagnosis for 's current behaviour is  Atypical Bulimia Nervosa F50.3. This is supported by 's current binge eating behaviour of "rubbish food" and subsequent "purging" activities to control her body weight i.e. excessive exercise and induced vomiting. There is an excessive preoccupation with her body weight and eating habits to the extent that she feels it interferes with her lifestyle.  also suffers from palpitations, which could be a result of the repeated vomiting and consequent electrolyte disturbance.  displays some of the features of Bulimia Nervosa F50.2 but not the full clinical picture. For example, there have been no significant changes in her weight over the past 5 years, which is often characteristic of individuals with Bulimia Nervosa. Also,  does not possess a "strong desire to overeat" consistently as in Bulimia Nervosa, this only occurs when she is feeling particularly anxious, stressed or low.  strives to maintain an "ideal weight of 58Kg" rather than deliberately trying to lose weight which is more characteristic of Anorexia Nervosa F50.0. The last time  weighed herself she was 58 Kg (although  feels she has put on weight) giving her a BMI of approx 20.1 Kg/M 2. This would discount a diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa in which the BMI is usually <17.5 Kg/M 2.  has not experienced any problems with her menstrual cycle which is another common feature associated with Anorexia Nervosa. 's eating behaviours appear to be exacerbated when  is felling stressed or anxious. There is also a correlation with relationships, when  feels settled her behaviour improves, when she feels insecure her behaviour deteriorates. The history of 's eating behaviour would support a past diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa F50.0. When her eating behaviour was at its worse, 's weight fell to 6 stone, which would have reduced her BMI dramatically. This diagnosis is also supported by the physical problems that  experienced at the time as a result of her eating behaviours - loss head hair, dry skin. A previous history of Anorexia Nervosa is a common finding in patients diagnosed with Bulimia Nervosa [1]. The trigger to 's history of anorexia may have been the parental disharmony that she witnessed as a child and her mother's consequent depression and suicide attempts. 's parents separated when she was 20 years old, prior to this there had been consistent arguing between the parents during 's late teens. This correlates with the point in her life when her behavioural symptoms were at their worse and her weight decreased to 6 stone. Since this episode, 's eating behaviours appear to be related to her relationships and  has recognised that her behaviour is worse when she is feeling stressed or anxious. At the time of the her parents separation, 's eating behaviour had improved although she was beginning to exercise more. This may have provided an alternative outlet for her tension and anxiety and  has maintained this exercise regime since. Recent stresses with the sale of the house have precipitated "naughty" behaviour and the recurrence of her binge/purge behaviours. The association between 's eating behaviours and anxiety/stress states may suggest an underlying Generalised Anxiety Disorder F41.1. However, there are no physical symptoms relating to 's anxiety state and so this is discounted as the primary diagnosis.  shows symptoms indicative of an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder F42 in that she: has obsessional thoughts about her weight and dietary intake displays rituals regarding binge/purge behaviour describes herself as feeling anxious is a perfectionist who likes order However,  currently displays no symptoms of depression, depersonalisation or abnormal slowness associated with this diagnosis.  may therefore have underlying personality traits e.g. obsessionality, low self esteem, perfectionism, which have predisposed her to develop these eating behaviours. An organic cause for 's eating behaviours is unlikely, however clinical investigations may help to eliminate e.g. an endocrine cause. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s)</heading><heading>Impression </heading> is an intelligent, articulate 30-year-old lady who has a long-term history of obsessions with her weight and problem eating behaviours.  has good insight into her illness but could not identify anything in her life that "triggered" her behaviour. <table/>Genetic factors are considered to be less important in Bulimia Nervosa compared to Anorexia Nervosa although potential genetic links have been identified [2] In terms of prognosis,  has identified and accepted that she has a problem and is motivated in her approach for help. However, her eating behaviour has been engraved for a long time and her treatment is likely to be prolonged because of this. <heading>Management</heading><heading>Reassurance and Explanation </heading> has acknowledged that she has a problem and has made a conscious decision to accept help. In order for her treatment to be effective, it is important that she understands that a long term approach will probably be needed. <heading>Investigations </heading><table/>If an electrolyte disturbance is detected, oral supplementation should be considered to restore the balance.  should also be encouraged to have a dental check due to the damage to enamel from repeated vomiting. <heading>Short Term Management</heading>As  does not currently appear to be displaying any serious medical problems requiring treatment i.e. serious metabolic disturbance, suicide risk, she can be treated on an outpatient basis.  states that she feels anxious and stressed at the moment due to the sale of her house. In the short term, she may benefit from an anxiolytic which will help to relieve the tension she is currently experiencing and the need to pursue her binge/purge behaviour in order to relieve this. Although  has no symptoms of depression, an SSRI such as Fluoxetine (60mg effective dose) would help to reduce the frequency of her binge/purge behaviour, however,  is reluctant to take medication as she "doesn't feel depressed". The physical consequences of induced vomiting should be explained to  so that she is aware of the potential damage and long-term complications i.e. hypokalaemia - renal damage, cardiac arrythmia and sudden death.  appears to be in the "Determination" phase of the Trans Theoretical Model of Change [3] as she has made a conscious decision to accept help. Psychological treatment should therefore focus on support, monitoring and encouragement in order to achieve this change. <heading>Long Term Management</heading>A stepwise approach should be adopted in the management of 's eating behaviours due to the long waiting list for referral to a psychologist. As 's motivation to change is high, guided cognitive behavioural self-help in the form of self-help books/manuals may  regain control over her eating [4].  should be encouraged to keep a diary of her food intake, episodes of vomiting and excessive exercise and attempt to identify any environmental stimuli, emotions or thoughts that precede this activity [5]. This would be monitored on an outpatient basis and if there are no significant changes then  should be referred to a psychologist for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. This would aim to change 's abnormal thoughts and behaviour and the distorted and rigid thinking patterns associated with her eating disorder. The recommended period of treatment for CBT in patients with Bulimia Nervosa is 16-20 sessions over 4-5 months [6].  would also benefit from a referral to a nutritionist who could advise  on more appropriate eating regimes and diets to control her weight. If there is no improvement with CBT then Interpersonal therapy should be considered although it would have to be explained to  that it can take 8-12 months to achieve results as there are 3 phases to treatment: Phase 1 - analyses interpersonal context of eating disorder Phase 2 - encourage interpersonal changes based on formulation of interpersonal problem area. Phase 3 - analysis of progress and development of ways to handle future interpersonal difficulties. As 's eating behaviours are associated with intense emotions, dialectical therapy which views the eating disorder as an attempt to control or change painful emotional states, may also be of benefit. Continuing support from the therapist is essential as most relapses occur within the first two years [7]. <heading>Outcome</heading> is currently being seen in the outpatient clinic on a 3 monthly basis.  has not yet been seen by a psychologist but has been actively reading self-help books to gain a greater understanding of her problems. <heading>Relevant Core Issues , Evidence Based Care and Issues for Research</heading>Prevalance - In community based studies, the prevalence of BN is between 0.5% and 1.0% in young women with an even social class distribution [5]. Approximately 90% of people diagnosed with BN are women [5]. Prognosis - A 10 year follow up study found that 52% had fully recovered and only 9% continued to experience full symptoms of BN [5]. If the illness is identified early enough, the prognosis is good. The serotonin theory for BN suggests that there is a low serotonin level in the brains of people who are irritable, depressed and anxious. If an individual binges on carbohydrate rich foods, the level of trytophan in their blood is raised. A high level of tryptohan in the blood enables some to cross the blood brain barrier and stimulate the synthesis and release of serotonin which relieves the dysphoric mood and the individual feels relaxed [5]. This theory may explain why SSRI's have been found to reduce the frequency of binge/purge behaviours in individuals with BN [8]. Research suggests that the level of vasopressin in the brain is also found to be abnormal in people with eating disorders and OCD. The hormone is normally released in response to physical and possibly emotional stress, and may therefore contribute to the obsessive behaviour seen in some patients with eating disorders [9]. The effect of the menstrual cycle and hormonal changes on eating behaviours is a possible area for future research as  recognised that her eating behaviours were exaggerated on week before her period. According to Lacey (1986), manipulation of eating behaviour is an individuals defence mechanism and a coping mechanism for dealing with emotional stress. Cognitive behavioural therapy focuses on the thoughts, behaviour, feeling cycle and helps to: Eliminate behavioural patterns and develop new ones Modify negative/irrational thoughts and beliefs Develop adaptive responses to situations CBT achieves full remission in 40% of patients with bulimia nervosa [10] and is recommended by NICE guidelines in the management of BN [9]. CBT has been shown to reduce the specific symptoms of BN and also improve non-specific symptoms such as depression [5]. <heading>Impact on your learning</heading>Organising a complex psychiatric history Difference between Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa Signs to look for on physical examination Identifying a suitable diagnosis using the ICD 10 classification system as patients may have symptoms applicable to a range of diagnoses.
