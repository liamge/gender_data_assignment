<heading>Objective </heading>To design a vehicle drive shaft using six typical composite materials and the comparison of the composite solution with the steel variant. <heading>Specification</heading>The following specification is typical of a drive shaft for a mid-size-vehicle: <table/><heading>Calculation method for ASH3501</heading>The composite is initially constructed using the 45 degree plies, which is the most efficient fiber orientation for carrying in-plane shear stresses. Since the applied torque for this application is positive (acceleration) as well as negative (reverse) there must be two plies for the torque transmission i.e. θ = +45◦ and theta θ = -45◦. As the first step, the strength and elastic properties of the six materials (see appendix) are in-putted into WinLap and the maximum (design) torque is translated into a shear force for the loading setup, since in laminate theory the equivalent of applying a torque T is applying an in-plane shear load Nxy.  FORMULA  A symmetrical laminate of [+45/-45 2/+45]S plies is then constructed in 'Lay Ups' and optimized by varying the ply thicknesses to achieve the maximum possible Tsai Hill value (where failure = 1). Once optimized (Tsai Hill = 0.9988) for torque transmission the composite is then checked for whirling speed:  FORMULA  Where the effective modulus Ex is obtained from WinLap. The result of the above calculation is below the design value and indicates insufficient bending stiffness. In order to increase bending stiffness, the most efficient fiber orientation is parallel to the shaft axis. Plies of θ = 0◦ are therefore added, symmetrically, giving the laminate construction [0/+45/-45 2/+45/0]. The thickness of the 0◦ ply required to satisfy the design whirling speed is obtained by modifying Eq.1 to incorporate the properties of the 0◦ plies and rearranging the resulting equation to find t0, thus:  FORMULA  Rearranging for t0 gives:  FORMULA  Adding the 0◦ plies of 0.087 mm thickness reduces the Tsai Hill value for the 45 plies to 0.94453 and therefore reduces the torque transmission efficiency of the laminate. The thickness of the 45◦ ply is therefore optimized to Tsai Hill = 0.99435 and the new value of t45 = 4 x 0.143 = 0.572 mm is substituted into Eq.3 to give the new corresponding thickness of t0 = 0.164 mm (i.e. 0.082 mm per ply). This value is then updated in WindLap and the resulting Tsai Hill = 0.99763. The laminate is at this stage optimized for maximum possible Tsai Hill (assuming thickness values to 3 s.f) therefore indicating that the laminate so far satisfies the whirling speed and strength criteria. The laminate is then checked for stability against buckling. The circumferential stiffness is the governing property for torsional buckling and therefore fiber orientations of θ = 90◦ are required. For an anisotropic material the critical buckling torque is given by:  FORMULA [Eq.4] D22 is the circumferential bending stiffness of the laminate obtained from the bending stiffness matrix Dij, and A11, A12 and A22 are the in-plane extensional stiffness values obtained from the stiffness matrix Aij. All values are obtained from the matrix produced in WinLap corresponding to the last optimization and the torque is therefore calculated to be:  FORMULA  The result shows that the torque which can be sustained using the existing laminate is significantly below the required design value. This indicates that the laminate is insufficient and that reinforcement is therefore required in the circumferential direction using 90◦ plies. This gives a new laminate of construction [90/0/+45/-45]S. In order to determine how far the design is from the target the circumferential bending stiffness D 22 is calculated for the required (design) buckling torque:  FORMULA  The 90◦ plies are then incorporated into the laminate using WinLap and the thickness t90 corresponding to the new D 22 is obtained by varying the thickness and converging onto the calculated stiffness value. This process produces a new set of values for the in-plane extensional stiffness A ij. The iterative process is repeated until a value of T ≥ 2000 Nm is obtained and the corresponding or 'satisfying' thickness t90 is noted. The iteration steps are as follows: <heading>1st iteration </heading> FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>2nd iteration </heading> FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>3nd iteration </heading> FORMULA  The buckling torque requirement is therefore satisfied at Tx = 2002.6 Nm. The new laminate which includes the 90◦ plies is then checked for whirling speed:  FORMULA   FORMULA  It can be seen that the addition of the 90◦ plies, which adds mass to the laminate, contributes very little to the overall effective stiffness of the laminate in the x-direction and therefore leads to a significant reduction in the whirling speed. An increase in the thickness of the 0◦ plies is therefore required in order to increase the stiffness and therefore meet the whirling speed specification. The thickness of the 0◦ plies required to satisfy the design whirling speed is obtained by modifying Eq.6 to incorporate the 90◦ plies and transposing the resulting equation to find the new t0, thus:  FORMULA  The new thickness is updated in WinLap and the thicknesses for the 45◦ plies are re-optimized giving t45 = 4 x 0.092 = 0.368 mm for maximum Tsai Hill = 99994. The new t45 is (as before) substituted, this time into Eq.7, to yield a new value t0 = 2 x 0.22 = 0.44 mm. Substituting this value into WinLap causes Tsai Hill to exceed 1.0 (i.e. failure) and the 45 plies are thus optimized giving t45 = 0.096 x 4 = 0.384 mm. The corresponding value is now t0 = 2 x 0.223 = 0.446 mm. This causes a drop in Tsai Hill and t45 is optimized to give 0.38 (0.095 each). Recalculating t0 gives 0.445 (0.222 each) and re-substituting this into the program shows that Tsai Hill is not significantly affected finally indicating that the iteration has converged at Tsai Hill = 0.99922. The laminate has now been optimized to meet the strength, whirling speed and buckling torque design requirements. Therefore total thickness of ASH3501 laminate = 1.502 mm <table/><heading>Results and Discussion </heading><table/>The results indicate that of the six materials analysed only four meet the requirements of the drive shaft specification. The two materials inappropriate for the design of the drive shaft are Kevlar 49 Epoxy and E-Glass Epoxy. In the case of the Kevlar 49 Epoxy the maximum possible whirling speed was calculated to be 1076.5 rad/s for a corresponding combined thickness of the laminate exceeding the permissible radius of the shaft. For the E-glass Epoxy the calculated t0 is a negative value (i.e. t0 = -6.581 mm), which is evidently not a logical result. The reason for this result is that the E-Glass Epoxy in particular has a lower specific modulus compared to the other materials (i.e. E/ρ = 21.44 GPa). Therefore in calculating t0 using Eq.3 the effect of the low El property of the material is a negative value in the denominator. This negative result generally signifies that the resonant frequency of the shaft is reached (?). Of the four suitable materials the IM6 Epoxy meets the design specification at the smallest mass (i.e. 0.369 kg). This is the expected result as the IM6 Epoxy has a comparatively higher specific modulus than the other materials. On the other hand the AS4-Peek meets the design requirements at the highest mass (i.e. 0.51 kg). This is because it has relatively the smallest specific modulus of the four materials. Of the four materials the IM6 Epoxy provides the most suitable choice for the shaft design. <table/>Comparing the steel and composite drive shafts, it is clear that that the IM6 Epoxy is more suitable overall. Although the steel solution provides a slightly thinner wall thickness, more importantly the drive shaft offers a significant reduction in the overall weight of the drive shaft; up to 4x lighter or 25% of the steel variant, while meeting the important design criteria. The composite shaft is also potentially more economical as it eliminates the need for bearings, joints and other parts that are otherwise often required in the design of steel shafts. <heading>Conclusion</heading>The results of this investigation have demonstrated the suitability of composite materials for drive shaft design. It was shown that four of the six materials were suitable for the drive shaft while the other two failed to meet the design specification. The material properties accounting for the differences between the two groups were confirmed to be the specific modulus of the materials. That is, the materials which encountered problems were those of lower specific modulus. Consequentially, the most effective material was identified as the IM6 Epoxy, as expected, owing to its relatively high specific modulus, while the lowest of the suitable materials, the AS4-Peek, was the least effective due to the lowest specific modulus of the suitable materials. Finally, composite design was said to meet the design, in all criteria, including those of cost and mass, more effectively in comparison with the steel solution.
