<heading>Introduction and Objectives</heading>I used Jaeger's method to determine the surface tension of distilled water. During Jaeger's method, water is slowly passed into a large container, displacing the air in the container. A bubble of air is formed in the liquid at the end of the capillary tube, and as air pressure increases it grows in size. The pressure in the manometer reaches a maximum, and immediately after this point the bubble breaks away. The maximum pressure head is read, and so is the depth of the capillary tube in the distilled water. The radius at the end of the capillary tube was measured using a travelling microscope, and in this particular experiment the radius was found to be 0.25mm, or 0.00025m. The density of the liquid and the density of the manometer were both found to be 1000 kgm -3. I took readings of the maximum manometer pressure head when the capillary tubing was at 5 different depths. I found the surface tension of the liquid at each depth, and used the 5 values to calculate the average surface tension. <heading>Results</heading><table/> FORMULA  <heading>Calculations</heading>To calculate the surface tension I used the following equation:  FORMULA  Where: is the surface tension of the liquid (Nm -1) h 1 is the depth of immersion of the capillary tubing (m) h 2 is the maximum manometer pressure head (m) p 1 is the density of liquid (kgm -3) p 2 is the density of the manometer fluid (kgm -3) r is the radius of the capillary tubing (m) For example: <table/> FORMULA  <heading>Discussion</heading><heading>Comparison to Literature Values</heading>The surface tension of water is 72.75 mNm-1, according to R.C. Weast's 'Handbook of Physics and Chemistry', 63 rd edition (1982).  FORMULA  My value = 0.1299 Nm -1 My value was 0.05715 Nm -1, or 57.15 mNm -1, larger than the literature value. I do not believe that such a large difference was entirely due to my errors. Jaegar's method is never entirely accurate because the bubble does not break away under ideal static conditions. <heading>Introduction and Objectives</heading>I used the Cambridge tension balance to find the surface tension of the following substances: <list>GlycerolCMCMilkAlcohol (ethanol)Corn oil</list>I then used the Cambridge tension balance to decide whether the following components are surface active: <list>Sodium ChlorideSugarDetergent</list>The Cambridge tension balance consists of a linked torson wire and suspended platinum loop. A tensioning device is situated at each end of the torson wire, one of which is attached to a calibrated scale. The force required to tear the ring from the liquid surface is determined. This is calibrated directly in terms of surface tension (dynes cm -1) and is read from the scale. This process uses Du Nouy's method. <heading>Results</heading><table/><table/><heading>Calculations</heading>I used the conversion factor 1 dyne cm -1 = 10 -3 Nm -1 to determine the surface tension in S.I. units. For example:  FORMULA  <heading>Discussion</heading>We took two readings for each substance, and used the second as it was more accurate. <heading>Comparison to literature values</heading><table/>I could not find a literature value for C.M.C. I could not find a literature value for corn oil, but I did find cotton seed oil (35.4 mNm -1) c and olive oil (33.0 mNm -1). c I can see that my values were lower than the literature values. From this general pattern, and taking the literature values for cotton seed oil and olive oil into consideration, I will predict that my value for corn oil was also lower. <heading>Source of Literature Values</heading>All of the literature values are from Lewis' 'Physical Properties of Foods and Food Processing Systems', which uses the following sources: <list>a = Weast, R.C.

There was a general trend that the literature values were lower than mine, which is probably because of the apparatus used. In surface-active components, a tension is produced at the interface because of an imbalance in the intermolecular forces. Sodium chloride is inactive in water because the surface tension of water is not changed with the addition of sodium chloride. Sugar is inactive in water because there is only a small change in the surface tension of water with the addition of sugar. Detergent is active in water because the surface tension changed significantly with the addition of the detergent.
