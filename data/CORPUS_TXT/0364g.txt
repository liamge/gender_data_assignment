<heading>Part 1 : Questions based on set Textbook</heading><heading>Why should the finite element method not be considered in isolation from the overall design process when we are considering the development of a new or revised engineering problem?</heading>The finite element method should not be considered in isolation as it is necessary that this analysis is included a part of the overall design process to ensure that the most appropriate design is developed or revised. As the design process is an iterative process it maybe necessary to go back to an earlier stage if a problem is detected in the later stages of the design. The finite element method should be used to help the designer solve the problem, by enabling another method of analysis to be used. <heading>What range of problems can now be routinely solved by the finite element method and what in your opinion limits the complexity of any model for a real engineering problem?</heading>A problem with solutions for which no solution functions exists, for example; <list>A structure with different materials that is spatially dependent on material properties,Irregular geometry,Complex boundary conditions. </list>These can now be solved by finite element analysis. The complexity of any model for a real engineering problem can be limited by the computing power available. The problem is also limited by the intelligence of the person that is running the analysis; the person needs to be able to manipulate the parameters of the analysis (e.g. mesh size) to enable the analysis to be appropriate to the real situation. <heading>Who was the first 'researcher' to consider modelling a continuum as an assembly of a number of discrete regions of constant shape and why was his contribution overlooked for many years?</heading>Courant in (1943) was the first 'researcher' to consider modelling a continuum as an assembly of a number of discrete regions of constant shape. His contribution was overlooked for many years as modern computers were not available to be used in the calculations needed for modelling the continuum as a number of discrete regions. <heading>What is the difference between the displacement and force approach to the finite element method, and why is the former the most popular and widely available?</heading>In the force matrix method the forces at the nodes are the unknowns and an assumed simple stress distribution is used to determine these forces. The displacement approach is used when the displacements at each node are not known and this method is called the stiffness method. The stiffness method has become more popular and widely used as it is simpler than the force matrix method. Once the structural stiffness matrix and nodal displacements are found it is a relatively simple calculation to that for the force matrix method. <heading>Why must we restrict the class of problems in this introductory course to those that are linear elastic and small displacement?</heading>If the problems are limited to those that are linear elastic with small displacements then a general mathematical description of the problem can be formed which can then be adapted and simplified to the various problems encountered. <heading>What is live and dead loading?</heading>Dead load is the structure's self-weight whereas the live load is the load that is applied to the structure. <heading>List the key ideas underlying the analysis of structures (the structure neither moves as a rigid body or fails and deflections are small).</heading>If the structure neither moves as a rigid body or fails and deflections are small then; Equilibrium of forces. Total force or moment on structure is zero. Internal stresses and strains that are produced locally when the structure is deflected slightly. Compatibility of the structure remains; topology is maintained even after deflection. The material elastic constant properties of the structure determine the magnitude of the deflections within the structure. <heading>Why do we often use a rectilinear co-ordinate system to define our geometry and boundary conditions for a problem, and to define the solution for the stresses (and strains)?</heading>A rectilinear co-ordinate system, such as the Cartesian, polar or spherical system is used to define the geometry and boundary conditions for a problem as they are the most commonly used within mathematics. The Cartesian co-ordinate system is the most commonly used in classical elasticity so it is easier to use rectilinear co-ordinate systems in finite element analysis. <heading>Why is it necessary for the general stress state at a point to be transformed into an equivalent set of principle stresses, and what graphical technique is used to show this transformation?</heading>It is necessary for the general stress state at a point to be transformed into an equivalent set of principle stresses as it is then possible to calculate the maximum shearing stress. It is also possible to get a mathematical relationship between the principle stresses and the principle axis and planes on which they act. Mohr's Circle for three-dimensional stresses can be used as a graphical technique the principle stresses. <heading>What are the elastic constants of a material and how many (state them) are needed to define all the elastic stiffnesses in the material property matrix [D ] for an isotropic homogeneous material?</heading>The elastic constants of a material are Young's modulus, shear modulus and poisson's ratio. You only need two of these elastic constants within the material property matrix [D] for an isotropic homogeneous material, these are; Possion's ratio (v) and Young's Modulus (E). <heading>Why do linear stress-strain relationships simplify the analysis of a structural problem?</heading>Linear stress strain relationships simplify structural problems as the relationship  FORMULA  can be used. E is defined by the slope of the stress-strain curve in the linear elastic region. This means that at low stress values in the linear elastic region the principle of superposition will still be valid. <heading>What is plane stress and how does it differ from the plane strain modelling situation? If E = 10000 stress units and Î½ is 0.3 use equations (2.29) and (2.30) to determine [D ] for both two-dimensional situations?</heading>Plane stress is used for problems where the dimension for thickness, z, is relatively small compared to the other dimensions, for example, in a plate or flat sheet. In this case equation (2.29) is used to calculate the [D] matrix.  FORMULA  (2.29) In the plain strain modelling situation the equation shown in equation (2.30) is used to calculate the [D] matrix. In plain strain the z dimension is large compared to those in the x- and y-directions, for example, in tubes.  FORMULA  (2.30) Using equation (2.29) to calculate [D]:  FORMULA   FORMULA  Using equation (2.30) to calculate [D]:  FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>Why are the majority of finite elements characteristics derived using an expression for the total potential energy?</heading>Mottram and Shaw, 1996, states that 'more than 88 per cent of the continuum elements are derived by applying the principle of maximum potential energy over an element'. Total potential energy is used because when an elastic structure is loaded by external forces the potential energy within the structure increases. Strain energy is generated due to the deformation of the structure, the deformation and potential energy can then be used to derive finite element characteristics of a structure. <heading>What principle is used, and what branch of mathematics is harnessed when developing the finite element equation?</heading>When developing the finite element method the Rayleigh-Ritz method is used to find approximations of the displacement components of u, v, w. The branch of mathematics that is used is known as the calculus of variations and was developed by Rayleigh in 1870. <heading>Pages 50 to 52 show that we form the finite element characteristics using an integral equation known as a functional. This leads to a mathematical solution which is termed as 'weak'. Why is this the case and how do we obtain a 'strong' mathematical solution?</heading>Integral equations known as a functionals contain differential equations that state the problem. These lead to mathematical solutions that are termed weak as the conditions that are stated must only be met on average throughout the structure. A strong mathematical solution is obtained when conditions are met at every point within the structure. <heading>Write out Equ (3.2) and define each of the six energy terms.</heading> FORMULA  (3.2) The potential energy of an elastic structure is increased when it is loaded by external forces or moments. The general equation for this potential energy,  FORMULA , can be written in the form of equation (3.2). Where there are six energy terms.  FORMULA  - This term is accounts for the potential energy due to the current levels of stress and strain within the linear elastic structure.  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  - The second and third terms are representing the energy changes due to the initial stress,  FORMULA , and strain,  FORMULA , within the structure.  FORMULA  - The forth energy term accounts for any energy due to the presence of any body forces as the structure deforms.  FORMULA  - The fifth term represents the work done by surface tractions as the structure deforms.  FORMULA - The final term in the general potential energy equation represents the potential energy lost due to any external concentrated forces or moments acting on the structure as it deforms. <heading>In the process of discretising a continuum, such that its behaviour is described by displacement values at a specific number of points (i.e. the nodes), can we expect the solution to give accurate displacements and stresses on a point-to-point basis? Justify your understanding of chapters 1 and 2.</heading>At the node there is an accurate displacement and stress as this is where the analysis takes place and produces an accurate value. In between the nodes the results are not as accurate as no analysis takes place at these points. <heading>Why must shape function Ni have unit value at node i and zero value at all other nodes in the element?</heading>To ensure that the displacements at all of the nodes are correctly calculated the shape function must have unit value at node i and zero value at all other nodes. <heading>Why is the solution by the displacement FEM referred to as a lower bound solution?</heading>The solution by the displacement FEM is refereed to as lower bound as the strain energy calculated is less than the actual strain energy within the structure. As the number of degrees of freedom is increased within the calculations the calculated strain converges towards the actual strain energy within the structure. <heading>Does such a solution lead to an over-flexible or over-stiff structural analysis and what effect does this have on the stresses predicted?</heading>Using shape functions in a displacement distribution leads to an over-stiff solution that is not valid for every point within the structure but is valid globally. This over stiff solution leads to stresses being overestimated, which is not beneficial when designing. <heading>Why must an element be able to possess constant strain throughout, and when should this condition be reached?</heading>An element must be able to possess constant strain throughout in order for the finite element method to work on any assumed displacement distribution and a reliable model for a small element to be achieved. This condition is reached when the second term in the displacement distribution polynomial is linear. <heading>Part 2: Static Analysis</heading>The plate shown in the diagram below has the following properties: <list>Thickness of 2 length units  FORMULA Young's Modulus of 30000 stress units  FORMULA Poisson's Ratio of 0.25  FORMULA </list><picture/>The plate above deforms such that the analysis is small displacement and linear elastic. <heading>Element 1</heading>Considering element 1 as shown below: <picture/>As element 1 is a 3 noded triangular element, it has six generalised coefficients and, therefore, six nodal degrees of freedom. The Element force vector {Fe} and the element nodal displacements {Î´e} for element 1 are stated next:  FORMULA  FORMULA  To calculate the element stiffness matrix [k] it is necessary to calculate the matrices [B] and [D]: For this element, [B] can be obtained from the co-ordinates of the nodes 1, 2 and 3  FORMULA  FORMULA   FORMULA  FORMULA   FORMULA  FORMULA  Where, in this case:  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA   FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  These values can be substituted into the equation below to form matrix [B].  FORMULA   FORMULA  To calculate the element stiffness matrix, [k], it is necessary to calculate the transpose matrix [B]T.  FORMULA  The material property matrix [D] is obtained from the general matrix form of  FORMULA . In plane stress problems, for example in this case of a plate, the z-dimension is relatively small compared to those in the x- and y-directions. Equation (2.29) can therefore be used to obtain the material property matrix.  FORMULA  (2.29) The material property matrix for element 1 is calculated below:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  To calculate the element stiffness matrix, the equation  FORMULA  is used.  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  This is the element stiffness matrix for element 1. <heading>Element 2</heading>Considering element 2 as shown below: <picture/>The Element force vector {Fe} and the element nodal displacements {Î´e} for element 1 are stated next:  FORMULA  FORMULA  To calculate the element stiffness matrix [k] it is necessary to calculate the matrices [B] and [D]: For this element, [B] can be obtained from the co-ordinates of the nodes 1, 2 and 3  FORMULA  FORMULA   FORMULA  FORMULA   FORMULA  FORMULA  Where, in this case:  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA   FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  These values can be substituted into the equation below to form matrix [B].  FORMULA   FORMULA  To calculate the element stiffness matrix, [k], it is necessary to calculate the transpose matrix [B]T.  FORMULA  The material property matrix for element 2 is the same as that for element 1, as the terms within the matrix are governed by the material properties of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio which are the same for both element 1 and 2.  FORMULA  To calculate the element stiffness matrix, the equation  FORMULA  is used.  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  This is the element stiffness matrix for element 1. <heading>Structural Stiffness Matrix</heading>The structural stiffness equation for each element can be used to calculate the governing structural stiffness for the entire structure. The two element stiffness matrices are given below and these can be combined to form the structural stiffness matrix.  FORMULA  Element 1:  FORMULA  Element 2:  FORMULA  The governing structural stiffness equation:  FORMULA   FORMULA  As there will be no deflection at node 2 and the deflection at node 4 will be only in the x-direction the governing structural stiffness equation can be reduced to:  FORMULA  From the diagram the forces applied to the structure can be inserted into the structural force vector:  FORMULA  Solving the governing set of simultaneous equations (in MATLAB) for the unknown nodal displacements in the following matrix the deflections acting on the structure can be calculated:  FORMULA  The deflections of the nodes in the element (to 3 s.f.) are stated below when the structure has the forces stated applied to it:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  The next page shows a sketch of the deformations of the plate. The solution given by the finite element analysis as performed above is given superimposed in blue on the diagram along with the expected real plate deformation in green. The expected real plate deformation is slightly different to the solution given by the finite element method as the plate will behave slightly differently in real life when a force is applied as outlined in the problem. The plate will bend slightly in between the points of deflection, so that the sides of the plate will not remain straight as shown in the finite element analysis undertaken above. To show this bending of the sides of the plate it would be necessary to split the plate into more elements and then the finite element analysis perform once again. This would increases the number of nodes under consideration and therefore the deflection along the side of the plate could be considered. To perform this analysis with more nodes an appropriate mesh size would need to be used. The plate could be drawn in SolidWorks and COSMOSWorks used to perform the finite element analysis. This would produce a more accurate shape of the deformation of the plate than the one shown through the calculations above with two elements.
