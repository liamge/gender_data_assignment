<heading>Referral information Source of referral and a summary of key information</heading>Admitted to  Ward at  Hospital () on  via GP for a 3-day history of cough and wheeze. <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background. The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading> is a three-month baby boy born in  2004. He was diagnosed with Down's syndrome at birth, a concomitant severe atrio-ventricular septal defect (AVSD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). As a result of this, he has open access to the paediatric ward at  hospital (). Referring to the presenting complaint, 's mother described a three-day history of dry, non-productive cough with wheeze, which was exacerbated by feeding and relived by sitting him up. There are no apparent environmental precipitants. The wheeze was worse in the mornings, and accompanied by a congested nose at all times. This is the first time  has had a significant wheeze. 's mother thinks she may have been suffering from "Snuffles and a cough" in the days leading up 's presentation. These symptoms have caused  to take longer over his feeds than before. There was no sweating, fever, rapid breathing, vomiting, or regurgitation. During the bouts of coughing there was no significant colour change or choking episodes. There is a family history of asthma with 's mother, and brother both diagnosed. There is also a family history of atopy, with 's father suffering from eczema and psoriasis.  was diagnosed with Down's Syndrome at birth. He has the typical features of the syndrome, including widely spaced eyes, low set ears, a slanted forehead and stubby fingers. His first clinical examination revealed a marked ejection systolic murmur, which lead to the echocardiogram described later and the diagnosis of Atrio-ventricular septal defect (AVSD). The AVSD was corrected surgically three weeks ago at  Children's Hospital (CCH). The PDA corrected itself spontaneously before surgery. On admission,  was prescribed Amiloride (3µg bd) and Frusemide (3mg bd). He has no apparent allergies. He has not currently had any immunisations, as he was hospitalised the day before his appointment. He is exclusively breastfed, excepting his NG feeding whilst in hospital. Excepting the asthma and atopy described above, the family history is unremarkable. The family have a pet dog, and neither parent smoke. 's mother is an estate manager at a farm, and the local water company employs his father. Neither feels they are unduly exposed to industrial chemicals.  has a fit and well 20-month-old brother. They live in a large detached house in the rural Midlands. 's mother said her pregnancy was unremarkable except for her 'triple test' at 16 weeks showed her to have a 1% chance of having a Down's baby. She was offered amniocentesis at nineteen weeks, but as there was a 1% risk of miscarriage with the procedure anyway, she declined.  was delivered by emergency LSCS to his 36-year old mother. Labour was induced for possible IUGR. He was delivered at 38 weeks. Apgars were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. He was then transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) for 4 hours.  currently has a normal developmental history, he began to 'fix and follow' at 4 weeks, and began smiling at 8 weeks. He opens his bowels and bladder normally. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading><heading>General</heading><list>HR- 160/min.

Biologically,  has just recently undergone major heart surgery at a tertiary referral hospital, and currently has wheezy breathlessness that is affecting his feeding. Psychologically, there is considerable worry as  has just undergone major cardio thoracic surgery in CCH, and now presents 3/52 later with a respiratory problem. There is also the added recent worry of having to cope with a chronically ill family member. Socially, the family also have a 2-year old son and live in rural ; so repeated trips to  are proving to be inconvenient. <list><heading>Summary:</heading>Breathlessness.Problems feeding.</list><heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management.

His wheeze was considerably more marked, and  had cyanotic episodes when feeding. He was admitted and placed on 2L 28% O 2 via nasal cannulae, and his Amiloride and Frusemide were both increased. A repeat CXR was taken on 6/9/04 and showed no sign of cardiomegaly, but marked R U lobe consolidation. On 's readmission, a cardiology opinion was sought. They stated that following surgery such as 's, it is not uncommon for the patient to suffer residual pulmonary venous hypertension for several months, and a viral respiratory tract infection would only exacerbate the situation. The infection itself would also take longer to clear. A Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) screen via nasopharyngeal swab was negative. However, RSV does not exclusively cause bronchiolitis. <heading>Evidence based medicine (EBM) and issues for research A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s)</heading>Rather surprisingly, there is little EBM on management and medical intervention in those suffering with Down's syndrome. However, there was some EBM on risk stratification and DS screening. <heading>Risk stratification and DS screening</heading>Screening for Down's syndrome with four measurements in maternal serum is increasingly common. The four markers are alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated oestriol, human chorionic gonadotrophin and inhibin-A. Results are used by a computer programme, together with gestational age, to compute a risk of an affected child. A positive test is one in which the risk of an affected child is higher than 1 in 300 [1]. The population in the paper were 46,193 pregnancies in 14 London hospitals over five years, in which the quadruple test was applied to serum samples between 14-22 weeks of pregnancy. A test was deemed positive if the computed risk of an affected foetus was 1 in 300 or greater. The quadruple test was found to have a Sensitivity of 0.81 and a Specificity of 0.93. Just under 98% of positives recorded with this method were false positives [1]. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>In 1887 Landon-Down described a syndrome of mental handicap associated with various physical abnormalities and a supposed resemblance to members of the Mongol race. This unfortunately led to this condition becoming known as mongolism but the condition is now known as Down's syndrome or trisomy 21[2]. Overall Incidence of DS is 1:650, however this is strongly dependent on maternal age; a female aged between 20-29 has a 1:1000 risk, increasing to 1:100 in a 35 year old, and 1:30 in a 45 year old. Both males and female may be affected, although it is more common in males. Common clinical features include a flat face, three fontanelles, slanting eyes, epicanthic folds, Brushfield spots (white spots on the periphery of the iris) small ears (which are also low set), a simian crease, short stubby fingers, hypotonia, universal yet variable learning difficulties, with up to 50% having a congenital heart defect. There is no obvious geographical predilection to Down's Syndrome, but it is thought to be more common in Caucasians. As discussed earlier, Down's syndrome is due to trisomy 21 (hence its alternative name). In 95%, DS occurs because of failure of meiosis resulting in one gamete having an extra copy of chromosome 21. It is this form that is associated with increasing maternal age. 2-3% of DS is due to chromosomal translocation. The remaining DS cases are due to mosaicism. In these cases, the degree of learning difficulty is dependent on the proportion of abnormal cells. There are several associations between DS and other diseases. Up to 40% are born with congenital heart defects, the commonest being AVSD, Atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus and tetralogy of fallot are all well reported. Duodenal atresia occurs in 10%, Hirschsprung's disease in 3%. Less commonly, patients may be born with an annular pancreas, and there is an association between DS and sensinoural deafness. Management of DS should acknowledge that the condition has a relatively high mortality in the first year of life, many individuals go on to have fulfilling adult lives. Initial management involves confirmation of diagnosis using chromosomal analysis, as if the DS was due to chromosomal translocation this has implications for future family planning. An ECG is mandatory to screen for the congenital heart defects mentioned. Tests for congenital hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria should be carried out as with other local screening programs for neonates. Later management of an individual with Down's syndrome and their family is a complex topic requiring a multidisciplinary approach. In the UK the basis of this approach is formed by a local Child Development Centre, and early referral to this is very important. Referral to relevant specialists and health care professionals can be initiated by this team [3]. Bronchiolitis is inflammation of the bronchioles, the smallest ducts that lead to an alveolus. It is the commonest cause of chest infections in children; in winter months it can be responsible for half of all paediatric hospital admissions. It is most common in those aged below 18 months (peak incidence 3-6 months), and for reasons that are currently unclear it is more common in males. It most commonly presents with coryzal symptoms, rhinorrhoea, tachypnoea, and difficulty feeding over the succeeding 2 or 3 days. In mild cases, the child improves; however, in some cases the condition progresses with increasing breathlessness, wheeze, cyanosis and pyrexia. on examination the child has rapid, laboured breathing, tachycardia, gross lung hyperinflation producing a barrel-shaped chest, prominent neck veins and downward displacement of the liver. Auscultation reveals widespread wheeze and crepitations over both lung fields. There is increased expiratory time [4]. The aetiology and pathogenesis of bronchiolitis is well understood. The respiratory syncytial virus causes Ninety percent of cases; the remainder are due to other respiratory viruses such as parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, rhinovirus and the adenoviruses [5]. Infection and subsequent inflammation leads to bronchial obstruction by oedema, mucosal debris and viral invasion. There is also air trapping, atelectasis (partial or complete lung collapse), and resultant reduced ventilation. A differential diagnosis of bronchiolitis may include infantile asthma, congestive cardiac failure, foreign body inhalation, pertussis, or bronchopneumonia. Management may or may not involve hospital admission. Criteria include: <list>Being in a high risk group (prematurity, long standing lung disease, cardiac disease, immunocompromised infants.)Apnoea.Difficulty feeding.<3 months.</list>Treatment is supportive. It includes isolation from non-infected infants, humidified oxygen if O 2 saturations drop below 94%, paracetamol for fever, antibiotic cover if there is evidence of 2º bacterial infection, NG feeding and IV support if indicated. Ribivarin is licensed for treatment of severe bronchiolitis, although there is little evidence to support its clinical efficacy. If O 2 saturations persistently drop below 92%, ventilation should be considered. Prognosis is good, with a mortality of less than 1%, although there are now tentative links to bronchiolitis and subsequent development of asthma in atopic individuals. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading><list>Presentation, complications and management of Down's Syndrome, differential diagnosis of wheezy breathlessness in infants, presentation and management of bronchiolitis.</list>NJ Waldal.
