<heading>1) Determination of surface tension of distilled by using Jaeger's method. (summary part)</heading><heading>Aim</heading>The aim of the experiment was to use Jaeger's method to determine the surface tension of distilled water. <heading>Method</heading>The method involved using a large container of water, that enable water to enter into it slowly. The water entering it, caused air from the container to be displaced and this meant a bubble of air formed at the top of the capillary tube. When the air pressure increased the bubble broke off and the point just before this was the maximum pressure in the manometer and this pressure head (h 2) was read off. Also the depth of immersion of the capillary tube (h 1) was read off. The radius of the end of the capillary tube was also found using a travelling microscope. The results observed were put into an equation to give the surface tension. <heading>Results</heading><table/>The capillary tube used had a diameter of 0.5 mm and therefore the radius was 0.25 mm. <heading>Calculation</heading> FORMULA   FORMULA  - surface tension of the water (Nm -1) At (h 1) of 0.017m  FORMULA  At (h 1) of 0.020m  FORMULA  At (h 1) of 0.043m  FORMULA  At (h 1) of 0.057m  FORMULA  At (h 1) of 0.070m  FORMULA  <heading>Discussion</heading>All the results were quite consistent except for at (h 1) 0.020m. The result was higher than expected at 0.18204 Nm -1 where as three of the other values were lower at 0.10086 Nm -1. The anomalous result may have been down to an inaccuracy in measurement readings. The main source of error was the measurement of internal bubble pressure and this could be improved by using an inclined-tube manometer. Repeating the readings may have also given a more accurate result. <heading>Conclusion</heading>The surface tension of distilled water was found to be 0.10086 Nm -1. This value was higher than the actual value for the surface tension of water at 0.07275 Nm -1 . The method used did not give absolute values of surface tension as bubble formation is a dynamic situation. However the method was still useful in the comparison of other liquids or comparing the surface tension of a liquid at different temperatures. <heading>08/02/05 Experiment F - Surface Tension2) Determination of surface tension using a surface tension balance</heading><heading>Aim</heading>The aim of the experiment is to use the Cambridge balance to determine the surface tension of glycerol, CMC, milk, alcohol and cooking oil. Surface tension is the manifestation of the forces of attraction that hold molecules together in the liquid state. Certain components are surface active when added to water. Determine whether sodium chloride, sugar and detergent are surface active. <heading>Method</heading>The method involved using the Cambridge surface tension balance. First the platinum ring on the balance was washed, then flamed in a Bunsen burner. The ring was then placed on the arm. The liquid was poured into a glass petri dish and placed on the table. The scale was set to zero and the arm with the ring attached, was set so the ring just touched the surface of the liquid. The force on the ring was gradually increased by adjusting the scale. The surface tension reading was taken when the ring was torn form the surface of the liquid. This was repeated for each sample and the ring was cleaned when a different liquid sample was used. The surface activity was also tested. This was done in exactly the same way as above. Water was used as a standard to compare the surface activity when other chemicals were added to the water. The surface tension from the Cambridge balance was measured in terms of dynes cm -1and this was converted to the SI units of Nm -1. <heading>Results</heading><table/> FORMULA  <heading>Surface Activity</heading><table/><heading>Discussion</heading>All the values obtained for the surface tension were consistently lower than the actual values for surface tension. According to the data book the surface tension of water is 72.75 mN m -1 or dynes. The value obtained for water was lower at 47.0 or 54.9 mN m -1 when the water was retested. However because all the values were consistently low, the surface tension order of the liquids was still determined. The reason for the low surface tension readings may have been because the sample was contaminated. Contamination occurred when the dish was not sufficiently cleaned when a different liquid was used or through the loop if it was dirty. The sample must be pure to obtain an accurate reading as even the minute bit of grease, lowers the surface tension. Only one of the three liquids tested had surface activity. The detergent was surface active. This is because when detergent was added to the water, the surface tension decreased dramatically from 54.9 mN m -1 to 22.0 mN m -1. The surface activity of sugar was inactive even though the surface tension value decreased slightly. This decrease may have been due to a contaminant because sugar is not surface active. <heading>Conclusion</heading>In conclusion water had the highest surface tension. As the surface tension of water was high, there must have been strong forces between the water molecules. As the surface tension of a liquids decrease, the forces between the molecules in the liquid also become weaker. Alcohol had the lowest surface tension and this may have been due to its covalent bonding. The detergent showed surface activity as it was insoluble in water. This was because the detergent worked by decreasing the surface tension of the water and also increasing its spreading properties. The detergent collected at the liquid interface and lowered the interfacial tension. The sugar and sodium chloride did not show surface activity. This can be explained by the fact they are soluble in water. Surface active components are usually used in the stabilisation of emulsions.
