<heading>Experimental Procedure</heading>100mL standard solutions were prepared by serial dilution of 0.1M NaF solution to give solutions of concentration: 10mM, 1mM, 100M, 10M and 1M. 25 mL of each standard was placed in a separate polyethene beakers labelled A to E. 25 mL of saturated solutions of each MgF 2, CaF 2, SrF 2, BaF 2 and PbF 2 were placed in 5 more polyethene beakers, labelled F to J. To each of these beakers 25mL of total ionic strength buffer (TSISAB) was added. The 10 beakers were mixed well and left to equilibrate in a water bath at 25C. Unfortunately, the water baths were not functioning very well, so the temperature of each of the solutions was recorded with the EMF to be taken into account in calculations as the temperature wasn't very constant. A Fluoride ion selective electrode was cleaned with distilled water and then placed in the first solution (A). Once the potentiometer had settled to a stable reading, the potential difference and temperature were recorded. <heading>Results</heading><table/><table/><heading>Questions</heading><heading>1. </heading>The fluoride ion selective electrode, was used in conjunction with a standard calomel electrode as an external reference electrode in this experiment. The ion selective electrode comprises a chamber which is impermeable, except via a solid state crystalline pressed pellet of europium doped lanthanum fluoride (LaF3) which acts as a membrane. The chamber contains an electrolyte solution of sodium fluoride (NaF) and sodium chloride (NaCl). <heading>2.</heading> FORMULA  where E is the electrode potential, E is the standard electrode potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 JK-1mol-1), T is the temperature in Kelvin, 0.1 is the concentration of fluoride ions in the fluoride ISE, and [F-] is the concentration of fluoride ions in the solution. <heading>3. </heading>The nernst equation given in question 2 may also be written as:  FORMULA  Since E/ E is the potential difference and log0.1 = -1, this is the equation for the calibration curve (Figure 1):  FORMULA  Therefore I would expect the gradient of the graph to be - RT/F.  FORMULA  The gradient for the calibration curve (Figure 1) was found to be 0.0532. the difference between this value and the theoretical value calculated above, is probably due to the variation in temperature. A mean value for T of 297.5 was used in the calculation above, however, the actual values of the temperatures of the solutions varied by approximately 0.5K about this value. This discrepancy was unavoidable as the water baths were broken, but if the experiment were repeated, it would be essential to ensure that all the solutions were at the same temperatures. <heading>4. </heading>The Total Ionic Strength Adjustment Buffer (TISAB) is added to ensure the ionic strength of the solutions remains constant. This is important because the electrode measures the activity of the fluoride ions, which is affected by both the concentration of the ion, and the ionic strength. By ensuring that the ionic strength will be same for each of the solutions, the effect of different concentrations of ions alone on the potential difference can be measured. <heading>5. </heading>The plot of the concentration of fluoride ions in the saturated solutions against the ionic radius of the metal ions has a minimum, close to the point for Ca, and rises fairly sharply from this point. The curve rises most sharply for ionic radii larger than that of Ca. This is because the size of these ions is much greater than the relative size of the molecules of the solvent and the other ions in solution (F-). This means that many small molecules of solvent or fluoride ions may be 'packed' around large metal molecules and solvate them. The electrostatic repulsions between 2 metal ions of charge +2 are reduced in this way. The solubility of ions with ionic radii smaller than that of Ca increases because the metal ions have atomic orbitals that are approximately the same size as those of the solvent molecules and F- ions so these orbitals can overlap more easily and therefore they are more easily solvated. The solubility of the ions increases as the ionic radius decreases from this point, as more metal ions can be packed into the solution. <heading>6. </heading>The calcium flouride has the lowest solubility because it is of comparable size to the fluoride ions. This means that it is more difficult to pack the ions together, as for each calcium ion there are two fluoride ions, to pack in with the solvent molecules.
