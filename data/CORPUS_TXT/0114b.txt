The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading>Describing the events that lead to 's diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, Mrs  said that  had been wheezy from birth and a CXR at 16/52 showed that  had a R U lobe pneumonia, and was treated with antibiotics. Over the next 40/52,  suffered from persistent chest infections was put on further courses of antibiotics and was also diagnosed as having 'infantile asthma'.  experienced extreme difficulty in gaining weight, despite having a "tremendous appetite". Mrs  was concerned as  had a "very big belly, but it was all at the front, and he was really as thin as a rake." For the first year of his life,  was a miserable baby who slept poorly and had bouts of inconsolable crying. Mrs  said he permanently had offensive smelling, yellow stools that were uniformly bulky. Neither antibiotics nor bronchodilators relieved 's wheeze, and after moving to a new GP in ,  was referred to the paediatricians at the  Hospital. A sweat test confirmed the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. He was transferred to the  Hospital (), and admitted for 2/52 for IV antibiotics and feeding. At this time 's mother was introduced to the CF nurse, physiotherapist, dietician and social workers that were to be involved in 's subsequent care. Mrs  learnt how to perform physiotherapy on ; the dietician advised Mrs  on the high calorie, high fat diet most suitable for . Since diagnosis, both Mrs  and  have been attending the CF outpatient's clinic at the A + B, and biannual visits to the regional CF centre at  Children's Hospital ().  has had "four or five" chest infections in the last year, but only one admission. Mrs  takes  to  to have the line inserted, and then cares for  at home. He does not attend school whilst the cannula is in place. 's admission to  in June this year was for a severe pseudomonas chest infection.  also has chest physiotherapy twice daily (am and pm), with both postural drainage and deep breathing exercises. Postural drainage involves  laying on his front for 20 minutes every morning, at the end of which his mother places a towel on his back, cups her hands and rather firmly beats both back and front of his chest in order to dislodge sputum from his airways. The deep breathing exercises involve  blowing up a balloon as far as he can, twice or three times daily.  is a very sporty young boy, and regularly plays football, cycles and plays tennis. Currently,  has no respiratory symptoms.  Has no abdominal pain, distension, and opens his bladder regularly. He opens his bowels every day, and Mrs  asks  to inspect his faeces and tell her if it is difficult to flush. There is no family history of cystic fibrosis. 's diet is very high in calories and fat. Breakfast is Cocoa pops, milk, toast and butter. He then has biscuits and chocolate at break. Lunch is usually cheese sandwiches, crisps, and chocolate for dessert.  has crisps when he arrives home. Dinner is commonly chips, turkey, and broccoli followed by cake.  also has some biscuits before bed. Mrs  also puts lots of table salt on 's food. He regularly sees his dentist to maintain his dental health.  has no other significant illnesses. Currently he is prescribed Polycal liquid 200ml (1 bottle/day), Colomycin + NaCl 20 million units/ 5 mls, bd nebulised), Vitamins A and D (4000 IU/400 IU bd po), Pancreatin (lipase, amylase, protease, 10000/8000/600 IU od po), Co-trimoxazole 80 mg + 400 mg/5ml, 5mls bd po), Salbutamol (100g/inhalation 2 puffs bds), Vitamin E (500mg/5ml, 2mls daily), and Flucticasone (50g/inhalation, 2 puffs bds).  is up to date with his vaccinations, and is going for his Influenza vaccine next week. Mrs  delivered  vaginally following a difficult pregnancy, as she was suffering from Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction and sciatica. He weighed 8lbs 8oz. He was not admitted to the Special Care Baby Unit. He was breast fed for 3/12, before transferring to bottle milk. Mrs  described a normal developmental history for , although she was concerned he was nearly 2 years old before he could walk. Mrs  feels  is very small for his age; he is nearly 6, but wears clothes for 3-4 year olds.  is doing well at school, and is comfortably "in the top half of his class"; despite  missing 1-2 days/month due to illness. Mrs  said the most significant problem was  coughing throughout the night, and being tired the next day. Otherwise, the only issue regarding CF at school is  taking his Creon tablets at lunchtimes. Before  was born, Mrs  was a hairdresser who ran her own business. 's father works for a large car manufacturer in the Midlands. Mrs  is now in receipt of a full-time carer's allowance for looking after . Mrs  also receives Disability Living Allowance for , and also has a reduction in her Council Tax bill. Mr  had to change his shift patterns at work so he could return home in time to look after  in the evenings. Mr 's work and colleagues have been very helpful toward the family, and have raised over £4000 though various sponsored events to allow the family to go to Florida in 2006. Mrs  has been in contact with the children's charity Banardo's, who helped Mrs  discover which benefits she was entitled to. She is aware of various CF support groups, but chooses not to use them as she feels  has a normal existence at the moment, and doesn't want to change it. Mrs  is in contact with the CF specialist nurse, who she describes as "invaluable." Describing her daily routine looking after , Mrs  said she has to get up at 6.30am every weekday morning in order to get  ready for school. She felt she could not return to work, as  frequently has to come home in the middle of the day due to illness. Mrs 's grandmother is also able to perform physiotherapy on  if she is not available. Mrs and Mrs  were considering having more than one child; however after the issues surrounding 's care, Mr  decided to have a vasectomy. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading><list><heading>General- BP= 96/60 Hr= 90, regular.

However, the following article was relevant: EBM Online: Support by another mother and a child-life specialist decreased anxiety in mothers of children with chronic illnesses 161 mothers of children who were 7 to 11 years of age; did not have mental retardation; and were diagnosed with diabetes, sickle cell anaemia, cystic fibrosis, or moderate-to-severe asthma (daily medication, wheezing 2 to 3 times weekly, and 1 hospital or emergency department visit in the previous 6 months). An experienced mother visited 86% of families with a child suffering form the same condition over 6 months. It found In mothers of children with chronic illnesses, support given by another experienced mother and a child-life specialist reduced anxiety [1]. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>Cystic fibrosis is the most common potentially lethal autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasian populations, characterised by chronic suppurative lung disease and chronic exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [2]. It affects 1 in 2500 infants from birth and the frequency of carrier heterozygotes is estimated to be 5%. It affects males and females equally. CF may present from birth in a multitude of ways, including: Meconium ileus- up to 10% of CF patients presents this way on the first day of life. Recurrent chest infections within 1 st year of life. Failure to thrive- up to 50% of CF patients in childhood or infancy. Meconium ileus equivalent may occur in later life. Clinical diagnosis of CF is strongly suggested by a meconium ileus. It presents within the first few hours of life with absolute constipation, bile-stained vomiting and abdominal distension. The secretory disorder in cystic fibrosis results in loss intestinal mucus and blockage of pancreatic ducts with loss of tryptic digestion. As a result sticky, inspissated meconium blocks the lower ileum of the foetus. Formal diagnosis involves either a sweat test or immunoreactive trypsin. The sweat test is diagnostic of cystic fibrosis. It is induced by intra-dermal injection of pilocarpine. The chloride concentration if greater than 60 mmol/l and the sodium concentration is greater than 70 mmol/l. Sodium concentration is greater than chloride concentration in the sweat. The mass of sweat should be greater than 100mg for an interpretable result, and the test is difficult to perform in those under 3/52 due to an inability to produce enough sweat. Infants with cystic fibrosis 1 to 2 weeks of age show increased levels of immunoreactive trypsin in the plasma in the neonatal heal-prick test. The test is positive if immunoreactive trypsin is greater than 80 mcg/litre. It currently the best screening test for cystic fibrosis but cannot be done after the first few weeks of life since it falls as pancreatic insufficiency develops [3]. The aetiology and pathogenesis of CF is increasingly understood. The defective protein is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) whose gene is on the long arm (q) of chromosome 7. This defective channel leads to a high concentration of sodium and a low concentration of chloride in exocrine secretions. There are many types of defect in the gene, of which the most common, a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508, accounts for about 70% of the total [4]. The clinical severity of cystic fibrosis varies between patients with the same mutation in CFTR. This suggests that there may be modulator genes that interact with CFTR. It is thought that the digenic inheritance of CF is responsible for variable severity of presentation. The phenylalanine lesion at position 508 is thought to account for the pancreatic insufficiency in CF. This causes malabsorbtion and subsequent failure to thrive. Genetic mutations resulting in abnormal epithelia enable bacteria to adhere more efficiently to respiratory epithelium. Mucus cannot be cleared efficiently by abnormal cilia, resulting in mucus build up in the lower airways. Chronic bacterial infection results in mucus gland hypertrophy, hypersecretion of mucus, and further infection. The bronchial wall is damaged, resulting in bronchiectasis. When established bronchiectasis is present and mucociliary transport is compromised, then clearance of the lungs is increasingly dependent on gravity and coughing. Small areas of parenchymal consolidation and fibrosis may develop as a result of impaired clearance. Principle colonising pathogens in CF include H. influenzae, S. aureus, and later Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonads. In advanced disease, there is increasing destruction of lung tissue and emphysema. The underlying principles of management of cystic fibrosis are: <list>Optimisation of physical and psychological growth Delaying the progress of the lung disorder Making the lifestyle of the patient and their family as normal as possible.</list>Management of the lung disorder is started early and aimed at maintenance of normal lung function for as long as possible. Bronchial clearance is attempted by vigorous daily physiotherapy and manual percussion, forced expiratory manoeuvres, and vibration in a variety of positions. There is also a role for postural drainage - laying in a variety of positions in order to drain mucus form the lower airways. There is also anecdotal evidence that vigorous aerobic exercise slows lung deterioration as it is thought to improve bronchial clearance. Antibiotic treatment can be both prophylactic and responsive. Prophylaxis is often lifelong to protect against S. aureus, the commonest childhood pathogen, H. inflenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas becomes and increasing problem with increasing age, and is often a benchmark for severe respiratory decline. Other pharmacological intervention includes bronchodilators and steroids (oral or inhaled), which may be beneficial in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Mucolytics (DNA-ase) improve mucus expectoration- the DNA is from bacterial infection and shed epithelium. Heart-Lung transplantation is the final treatment pathway for terminal respiratory compromise. Nutritional therapy in CF patients is also essential. Frequent liaison with a dietician is suggested, as CF patients are advised to be overweight; this is helpful during bouts of acute illness, when patients become anorexic. It is also thought that expectoration of sputum alone increases a CF patient's calorific requirement by 5%. The weight gain is achieved by excessive eating, Polycal fluid, or NG feeding at night. Pancreatic replacement therapy is in the form of granules or tablets. Pancreatic extract is degraded in the stomach by acid; the effectiveness of this form of treatment can be increased by administration of H2 antagonists such as cimetidine [5]. Vitamin supplements (A, D, E, K) are also prescribed. Finally, there are immense psychosocial issues surrounding families and suffers of CF that need to be addressed. Parents with an affected child need to be informed that there is a 25% risk of having another child with cystic fibrosis. An unaffected child has a 66% chance of being a carrier of cystic fibrosis, and a child of an unaffected sibling has about a 1 in 80 chance of being affected by cystic fibrosis, assuming that the other parent has a population 1 in 20 chance of being a carrier for CF. An offspring of an affected mother has a 1 in 40 chance of being affected by cystic fibrosis, assuming that the father has 1 in 20 chance of being a carrier. Adult males with cystic fibrosis are normally sterile, and adult females with cystic fibrosis are sub fertile. The diagnosis of CF is a life limiting one, and all members of the multi-disciplinary team should try to work together to help the sufferer cope with the feelings of anger, fear and depression that will inevitably occur. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading>Diagnosis, investigations and management of CF.
