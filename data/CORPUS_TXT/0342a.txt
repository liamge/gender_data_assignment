We shall supply low price bulbs of a range of qualities, as positioned in the map above. For a successful marketing campaign, we must look at the "Four P's". These are Product, Promotion, Price and Place. I will now investigate how these different sections can further our business. <heading>1.5 Product, Place, Price & Promotion</heading><heading>Product</heading><list><heading>Features:</heading>energy savingCFLsSoon to become the only legal bulbs for businesses.</list><list><heading>Quality:</heading>Varying qualities with correspondingly low prices, to cater for as wide a market as possible.</list><list><heading>Brand/image:</heading>Exclusive production from Ms Zi's company in ChinaSupply other bigger brands as the bulbs are too rare to make worthwhile producing ourselves</list><list><heading>Packaging:</heading>Packaging kept to a minimum to help reduce carbon emissions and unnecessary wastePacking substantial enough not to break bulbsDelivered by post for individual orders, or in bulk by van for larger (office) orders</list><list><heading>Guarantees:</heading>Standard one year guarantee with all products as a minimumBulbs can last up to 8000 hours, so we would expect the average bulb to last for a minimum of two years</list><list><heading>Service positioning:</heading>As an additional service for businesses we can fit out an entire new office and install light fittingsThis is done through an associated chain of electricians whom we can call up at short notice if necessary anywhere across the UK.</list><heading>Place</heading><list><heading>Customers:</heading>Primarily, advertising is based at small businesses and officesTargeting new businesses who will make for long term customersAvailable to anyone browsing the internetDomestic customers still benefit from the convenience and speed of delivery, though are unlikely to benefit from bulk buying discounts</list>Distribution: see "Selling" in promotion. <list><heading>Location:</heading>As a footloose web-based company, our location doesn't affect our customers.Can locate anywhere, allowing cheap premises.</list><list><heading>Stock levels:</heading>Lightbulbs don't go out of date or perish at a fast rate, so we would rather have more stock than necessary and always be relied upon to be able to supply any bulb at any timeSpecialising in energy saving and CFL bulbs.</list><heading>Price</heading><list><heading>Level:</heading>Varying prices depending on quality of the productUltimate aim is to undercut other distribution companies</list><list><heading>Sensitivity:</heading>By establishing ourselves early on, we will become noted as the pioneers in this market for when government legislation commands that only our types of bulbs may be used in businessesThe market inevitably drops over the summer months as there is less need for artificial lighting</list>Discounts and Payment: see "Sales Promotion" and "Selling" in promotion. <heading>Promotion</heading><list><heading>Communication plan:</heading>Essential in reaching the publicSeveral strategies which together should give us good promotion</list><list><heading>Advertising:</heading>Links from web-based DIY companies URL  URL  URL  URL Ideal for a web-based company such as ourselvesMakes it easy for shoppers to buy all their DIY products in one go online</list><list><heading>Viral Advertising</heading>Pop up adverts onlineParticularly related to DIY/home living websitesIdeal for a web based company</list><list><heading>Leaflets</heading>Leaflets advertising current promotions and new products to be sent out with each deliveryPartnerships with associated companies so every time they send out an order they enclose our leaflets, and vice versaDisplayed in non-chain DIY stores</list><list><heading>Magazines</heading>Large number of DIY and home improvement magazines available for advertisementsAdvertising in entrepreneurial magazines and newspapers too, to target new companies and businessesAdvertising in the Economist</list><list><heading>Sales promotion:</heading>Monthly promotions, according to customer sales and current interestDiscounts for bulk ordersFree P&P on orders over £25, encouraging bulk buyingDiscounts for new businesses using us for the first time, on condition they use us for a minimum of two more orders</list><list><heading>Public relations:</heading>User friendly websiteEasy search tools within website, enabling you to find the exact bulb you want even for the non-engineering mindedExtensive "Help" and "FAQ" pages12hour guaranteed reply to email queriesPhone line for any further queries</list><list><heading>Selling</heading>First class post as standard deliveryNext day delivery available on all orders for minimal extra"Within six hours" delivery service available for a premium priceAll transactions by Direct Debit over secure internet sites ensures fast turnaround and paymentConvenience and flexibility in not having to go to a shop, and always open</list><heading>Market Segment</heading>The energy-saving light bulb segment is fast growing, and there is a rapidly growing demand for these products by consumers. As referenced in the introductory letter, there is an opportunity to take advantage of possible future legislation changes in the type of light bulbs that will be available, energy-savers being the focus. As seen by the table on the following page, CFL (Compact Fluorescent Lamp) sales increased by 110% over the 4-year period, indicating a clear direction for the market as a whole. Enlighten will concentrate on maximising their sales by focusing on selling CFLs. <table/><heading> 1.7 Market Size</heading>From figure 1 we can see that the size in terms of total units sold does not change significantly over the four year period. However if we look at the market size in terms of retail sales, we can see an overall upward trend in the amount of money in this market. <figure/>Figure 2 shows a clear increase in market value, despite no rise in units sold. According to Mintel, however this is due to rising sales of specialist lighting, but this is linked directly to trends in luminaries/fittings sales. For CFLs, retail prices are falling, and therefore Enlighten must concentrate on sourcing cheap manufacturers in order to secure a decent profit margin.
