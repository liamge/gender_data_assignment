<heading>Referral information Source of referral and a summary of key information</heading>Mr  came to hospital with his wife on a Saturday morning due to a discomfort in his chest, which he had been experiencing for a week prior to presentation. This sensation had kept him awake the preceding Friday night and spread to a feeling of pain/heaviness in his left arm. He rang the out-of-hours GP service who advised him to go to hospital for further tests, where he was admitted on . <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background. The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading><heading>Presenting complaint: Chest pain.</heading><heading>History of presenting complaint:</heading>Mr  had been complaining of a vague tingling in his left infra-mammary region of his chest for a week prior to admission to hospital. This sensation came and went when he was doing activity, such as working in his allotment. It never came on at rest. The pain did not stop him form doing any activities and he rated it as 2-3/10 in intensity. The night before admission the pain was constant and radiated to his left arm, which prevented him from sleeping, as lying down made the pain worse. GTN spray did not relieve the pain. Early Saturday morning he tried some co-codamol which 'knocked him out' for a couple of hours. Before this current event Mr  experienced three years ago three episodes over one weekend of sudden shortness of breath during exertion. He visited his GP who prescribed GTN spray, which he had not used until the Friday night pre-admission. Mr  had not suffered from dyspnoea since the previous three episodes. He does complain of swollen ankles, which he puts down to his diabetes, which was diagnosed in 1991. He does not suffer from orthopnoea, PND, intermittent claudication or palpitations. He does complain of a dry intermittent cough, however, he is on an ACE inhibitor, which could explain this cough. He has never previously had an MI or CVA, he does suffer from hypertension and hypercholestrolaemia. During his admission at  hospital he had an ECG, which confirmed he had had an MI, he also had an echocardiogram to assess the function and integrity of the heart. The results from these investigations indicated that Mr  needed to be transferred to the  hospital for an angiogram. <heading>Past medical history:</heading><list>2000 - Bilateral cataracts operation1991 - Diabetes1988 - Hernia repair (umbilical and right inguinal hernia)Nil else of note</list><heading>Family history:</heading>Father died of a stroke at the age of 74, nil else of note. <heading>Drug history and allergies:</heading><list><heading>NKDA</heading>Insulin Humulin M3 (AM and PM)Simvastatin 40 mg OD - HMG CoA inhibitorAspirin 75mg - anti-plateletBisoprolol 1.25 mg OD - Î² blockerPerindopril 4mg OD - ACE Inhibitor</list><list><heading>Post-angiogram:</heading>Clopidogrel 75mg OD - anti-platelet (prescribed for 12 months post-angiogram to reduce the risk of stent-induced clots)</list><heading>Social history:</heading>Mr  was a foundry worker who was forced to take early retirement (full pension) at 55 due to peripheral neuropathy secondary to his diabetes. He lives in a house in  with his wife who is fit and well. He has one son who lives in . Mr  has never smoked He drinks about 6 units of alcohol a week <heading>Systems review:</heading>Neurological - Mr  described some odd sensation/numbness on his anterior leg and medial side of foot. He stated he often felt quite unsteady on his feet because of this sensation. He has never suffered from any faints, fits or funny turns, headaches, weakness or dizziness. There was nil of note from specific questions regarding the respiratory, gastrointestinal or locomotor systems. <heading>Analysis of history The most likely single cause of the presentation, other possible causes and reasons for these choices. The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>NSTEMI - the intensity of the pain described by the patient would more likely point towards this diagnosis. However, the patient is a diabetic with evidence of microvascular diabetic neuropathy, which could indicate that the chest pain was not so extreme because of his reduced pain receptor sensitivity. STEMI - the length of the pain on the preceding Friday could point towards this diagnosis as the pain was persistent and was not relieved with GTN. Musculoskeletal - this is a possible diagnosis as the pain was described as 2 - 3/10 in intensity and co-codamol helped to relieve the pain while GTN spray did not. However, the pain was not elicited with movement, which would make this diagnosis slightly less likely. Dypepsia - this is also a possible diagnosis as the pain was fairly low in intensity and was made worse on lying down. The positive negatives of the pain radiating to the left arm and no sensations of acid regurgitation would make this diagnosis less likely. It is unlikely to be respiratory in nature as the pain was not made worse on respiration, he was not breathless, the patient did have a cough but it was not productive and the patient did not feel like he had a fever, making this diagnosis unlikely. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading>A slightly overweight gentleman who was sitting comfortably in the chair No clubbing, peripheral cyanosis, tremour, splinter haemorrhages or xanthomata on his hands. There were bilateral dupuytren's contracture and his right wrist was bandaged due to post-angiogram access to radial artery. Pulse = 96 bpm, regular and weak in character, BP 112/73, RR = 18, O 2 sats = 99% on air, apyrexial No evidence of jaundice, anaemia, corneal arcus or xanthelasma in his eyes. No central cyanosis, oedema or lymphadenopathy JVP was not raised His chest, on examination, was symmetrical with no evidence of scars or asymmetry. <heading>Palpation :</heading>There were no sternal heaves on palpation. The apex beat was not palpable. No pain was elicited on palpation of the area the patient had felt the pain the previous Friday. <heading>Auscultation:</heading>Heart sounds were present in all areas, no added sounds were evident Respiratory - the lung fields had vesicular breathing with no added sounds in all areas. Abdominal examination - the bowel was soft and non-tender on palpation. No evidence of masses, organomegaly or ascites. On auscultation there were bowel sounds present in all four quadrants. Neurological - evidence of reduced light touch and vibration sense to mid-calf bilaterally. Nil else of note. <heading>Analysis of history and examination Reasons for your choice of the cause of the patient's problem(s) and any other cause that still needs to be considered at this stage</heading>The history and examination cannot rule out an NSTEMI or STEMI. However, the patient was non-tender on palpation and there was no evidence of consolidation on auscultation of the lungs, which makes a musculoskeletal or respiratory cause very unlikely. Dyspepsia cannot be ruled out at this stage, even though the patient was non-tender in the epigastric area. This diagnosis will need to be looked at further if the ECG shows no abnormalities at rest or on exertion. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>Mr 's symptoms although minor showed that he had in fact had a severe ischaemic event, which to his pain perception was not severe in nature. Mr  will need to be educated as to how his diabetes might have effected his pain receptors and if he should feel a similar persistent chest pain to present at the hospital quickly for assessment. His diabetes is showing levels of systemic complications with peripheral neuropathy, this will effect him socially as his walking and mobility will be compromised by reduced sensation. Mr  appeared psychologically well balanced, he had a good understanding of his diabetes and subsequent chest pain. However, any person who experiences a life threatening event such as an NSTEMI/STEMI will have psychological repercussions, as it is a reminder of ones own mortality. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management. Refer to the guidelines to the writing of portfolio cases for the details of the issues to be addressed under each heading.</heading><heading>Investigations</heading>: ECG - showed biphasic T waves anterolaterally an indication of acute coronary syndrome. Troponin I levels = 7.68, Creatine kinase = 769. Blood results from : FBC - HGB = 11.6, PLT = 247 and WCC = 10.26 Monday  Mr  had an angiogram. Arterial access was first performed at the right radial artery, however, this artery went into spasm preventing access. Therefore, the right femoral artery was used. Mr had a coronary angiogram and left ventriculogram. Angiogram results: Severe LAD disease, 2 stents were inserted RCA was small and non-dominant with moderate disease Circumflex had mild disease The ventriculogram showed good left ventricular systolic function with mild anterior and apical hypokinesia. <heading>Reassurance and explanation</heading>The events leading up to his admission and subsequent tests while in hospital were explained to him. He was given many opportunities to ask any questions, he was given all relevant literature to read and refer to when at home. <heading>Prescription/medical intervention</heading>Mr  was already on all medication recommended post NSTEMI to help reduce the risk of further cardiovascular events. His angiogram and subsequent stenting will help to reduce similar events occurring in the future. <heading>Observation</heading>Mr  will be reviewed by his GP and a cardiologist post-angiogram. An ETT will need to be carried out to ensure there is no severe T wave inversion. His GP will manage Mr 's diabetes and any other issues that may arise which could increase the risk of future events, such as an increase in blood pressure/cholesterol. <heading>Referral and team working</heading>The referral involved out-of-hours on-call GP service, A&E, Consultant cardiologist and team (at  and ), ECG technicians, radiograghers, specialist nurses, HCAs <heading>Advice and prevention</heading>Mr  was told to continue as he would do normally. Advice on diet, exercise and his diabetes was given. He was advised to see his GP if he has any new developments of chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath. He was given a routine follow-up appointment with the cardiology team to review progress. <heading>Outcome A description of the progress of the patient as far as possible. This should include consideration of further issues to be resolved. Where appropriate you should contact by telephone patients who have been discharged home.</heading>Mr was transferred back to  hospital later the same day as his angiogram. The post-procedural complication was a right femoral artery haematoma. There were no other complications. <heading>Evidence based care and issues for research A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s)</heading><heading>Routine early cardiac catheterisation and revascularisation :</heading>There have been a number of RCTs comparing early routine angiography versus medical treatment alone [1,2]. 1) An RCT compared invasive treatment within the first 7 days versus non-invasive treatment plus planned coronary angiography. Results showed that invasive treatment significantly reduced the combined outcome of death and myocardial infarction rate compared with non-invasive treatment after 6 months. They did however; find that early invasive treatment increased major bleeding, but not stroke, compared with non-invasive treatment [1]. 2) An RCT compared cardiac catheterisation at 4 - 48 hours and revascularisation versus standard treatment. Results showed that cardiac catheterisation reduced MIs and readmission for unstable angina after 6 months. This RCT also found that cardiac catheterisation increased bleeding compared with standard treatment [2]. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading><heading>Incidence and prevalence :</heading>Cororanry artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality in developed countries and in the developing countries it is becoming a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Death rates vary from nation and region. In the USA, for instance, the prevalence of CAD is nearly 4% [3]. Risk factors for ischaemic heart disease can either be fixed or modifiable: <list><heading>Fixed - age (risk increases with age), male sex, positive family history</heading></list><list><heading>Modifiable - smoking, hypertension, diabetes, LDL and total cholesterol levels [4].</heading></list><heading>Acute Coronary Syndrome :</heading>Is an umbrella term for ischaemic cardiac chest pain of recent origin and includes: unstable angina, NSTEMI, or an acute, evolving or recent MI. The latter has to show features of varying levels of cardiac markers, as well as the patient exhibiting either; ischaemic symptoms, development of pathological Q waves on the ECG, ischaemic ECG changes e.g. ST elevation or depression or following coronary artery intervention such as an angiogram/plasty [4,5,6,7]. These various events occur due to the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and subsequent thrombosis. A plaque may rupture and re-seal several times causing recurrent episodes of pain. The severity and type of the acute coronary syndrome will be determined by the severity and duration of the occlusion, the vessel affected and the presence of collateral blood supply [2,3]. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading>Different ways chest pain can present to A&E, different differentials for chest pain. To remember that an NSYTEMI/STEMI does not always present typically i.e. intense central crushing chest pain, impending doom, sweating, nausea. In atypical presentations to remember to include Troponin T in the routine blood tests. Acute coronary syndromes - what are they, how are they classified.
