Introduction</heading><heading>1.1 Finding the lattice parameter, a</heading>When an x-ray beam passes through a crystalline structure, diffraction occurs because the spacing between the layers of molecules is less than the wavelength of the x-ray radiation. The angle by which the wave is diffracted, FORMULA , can be modelled using Bragg's Law:  FORMULA  (Equation 1) where  FORMULA  is the wavelength of the x-ray radiation and  FORMULA  is the interplanar spacing of the crystal with Miller indices h, k and l. N is an integer value referring to the reading being taken at the nth maxima. <picture/> FORMULA  can be expressed as  FORMULA  (Equation 2) where  FORMULA  is the lattice parameter. By combining equations 1 and 2, the following relationship can be obtained:  FORMULA  (Equation 3) A value for a can therefore be determined from the gradient of the linear relationship between the maxima number, N, and a function of the diffraction angle,  FORMULA . Indexing can then be carried out, whereby the N values are attributed to different maxima depending upon the lattice type of the crystal: simple cubic (P), face-centred cubic (F) and body-centred cubic (I) {refer to table in lab script[2]}. When equation 3 is plotted with the appropriate set of N values for the three different lattice types, only one will yield a linear relationship passing through the origin and so the lattice type will be evident. Differentiating Bragg's Law shows that  FORMULA  (Equation 4) This shows that a small change in the lattice parameter leads to a large change in Bragg angle near back reflection. Consequently the higher order reflections are extremely sensitive to the lattice parameter and so in order to obtain a values to a greater degree of accuracy (~0.1%), measurements are taken at large values of  FORMULA  where such back reflection occurs. <heading>1.2 Identifying samples</heading>Once accurate values for the lattice parameter are obtained, these can be used to identify the sample that the x-ray beam was being diffracted by. The American Society for Testing Materials (A.S.T.M.) index identifies a sample based on the  FORMULA  values of its three most intense Bragg reflections. By inputting ranges for the three  FORMULA  values and the lattice parameter, a list of possible matches is formulated, which can then be further narrowed down using other characteristics such as the lattice type and colour of the sample in order to determine the nature of the sample. <heading>1.3 Vegard's Law</heading>Vegard's law states that if two crystalline materials with different lattice parameters are combined (melted together and cooled), then the lattice parameter of the new compound is expected to vary linearly with the atomic composition of the compound in question. Therefore if the proportions of two substances that make up a compound are known, then the lattice parameter will be that proportion of the way between the lattice parameters of the two substances. The experiment comprises two parts - in the first section the lattice parameters and lattice types for two unknown samples were calculated. These substances were then identified using the ASTM index. In the second section a compound mixture of potassium chloride (KCl) and potassium bromide (KBr) was created and its lattice parameter and interplanar spacings were determined so as to test Vegard's Law. <heading>2. Part (a)</heading><heading>2.1 Experimental Detail</heading>The camera used in this experiment (see Figure 2) consisted of a centrally mounted sample aligned between two collimators. The circular nature of the camera allowed a film to be placed around the inside of the case which absorbed radiation emitted at all possible values of  FORMULA . For convenience the circumference of the case  FORMULA  and so  FORMULA . The sample was ground up and added to a capillary tube to a depth of 25mm. This was then mounted in the centre of a camera such that it was in line with the collimators so that the x-ray beam would pass directly through the sample. The tube was vertically aligned (perpendicular to the path taken by the x-ray beam through the collimators) so that when it was rotated no precession occurred. This maximised the amount of time that the sample spent in the x-ray beam. The film was inserted and the camera was sealed in complete darkness and then positioned in the X-ray machine where the sample was rotated by an external motor. This utilises the isotropic nature of the crystalline structure to ensure that the effects of impurities in the sample are minimised. The sample was then exposed to the x-ray source for 7 hours. The x-ray source used in this experiment was a copper source that had a wavelength of 1.5425Å. This represents a combination of the two components  FORMULA  and  FORMULA [3] The diffraction patterns that occurred as a result of the scattering took the form of concentric rings centred about the focus of the x-ray beam where the beam exited the camera. <picture/>The geometry of the system is such that the diameter of these rings, D, is equivalent to  FORMULA  (see figure 2 above). This process was undertaken for both sample 1 and sample 2, with each sample exposed to the x-ray source for 7 hours. The film was then removed and developed in complete darkness. <heading>2.2 Results</heading><heading>2.2.1 Sample 1</heading><heading>i) Finding a</heading>The diffraction pattern as a result of x-ray diffraction through sample 1 was analysed. The diameter of each diffraction ring, D, was measured and hence the scattering angle determined. Measurements were made for the 9 visible diffraction rings ( FORMULA  to  FORMULA ) and then the results were indexed. This was achieved by attributing appropriate N values for  FORMULA  for each of the 3 hypothetical lattice types and identifying that which satisfied the linear relationship. For example for a face-centred cubic  FORMULA  maps onto N=3,4,8,... 24 (refer to table 1). These N and  FORMULA  values were then substituted in equation 3 and the relationship was plotted (see Figure 3). The linear relationship was apparent. The line passes through the origin and therefore it can be assumed that this is the correct lattice type. <figure/>Using equation 3  FORMULA   FORMULA  The gradient of figure 3 was found to be  FORMULA  and  FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>ii) Error Analysis</heading>Error in gradient, G, taken from Origin to be  FORMULA Å (0.247%) Error in  FORMULA  taken to be negligible a is of the form  FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>iii) Identifying the Sample</heading>The 3 most prominent lines were noted and these 3  FORMULA  values were used to determine the interplanar spacing, d, for each ring. This was achieved using equation 1: For an arbitrary maxima  FORMULA   FORMULA  The 3 lines with the greatest intensities were at  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  Using the ASTM database and inputting maximum and minimum values for d 1,d 2 and d 3, a list of 128 possible substances was found. These were further filtered by the use of other parameters. A visualisation is provided for each possible match showing the intensities across all N values. From this it was possible to compare the relative intensities of the potential matches with the film for sample 1 and thus reduce the list of possible substances. Features such as colour (which in sample 1's case was white), lattice type (sample 1 was face-centred cubic) and a value ( FORMULA ) also helped to further reduce the uncertainty in the list however the list was still too large to identify the sample. <heading>2.2.2 Sample 2</heading><heading>i) Finding a</heading>The diffraction pattern was analysed for sample 2. Once again the diameter of each diffraction ring, D, was measured and the scattering angle determined. For this sample 17 diffraction rings ( FORMULA  to  FORMULA ) were visible and these lines were indexed. These N and  FORMULA  values were substituted in equation 3 and the relationship was plotted (see Figure 4). The relationship was not linear and so required adjustment to compensate for any maxima that might not have been visible on the film that may have lead to incorrectly indexed N values. By assuming that maxima are missing from the film before  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  and therefore translating the  FORMULA  values up one at these two points before mapping N values, a linear relationship became apparent. The line passes through the origin and therefore it can be assumed that this is the correct lattice type. <figure/>Using equation 3 again  FORMULA   FORMULA  The gradient of figure 4 was  FORMULA  FORMULA  and  FORMULA .  FORMULA  (For error analysis refer to §2.1.2) <heading>ii) Identifying the Sample</heading>The 3 lines with the greatest intensities were at  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  By putting the upper and lower bounds for d 1, d 2 and d 3 into the ASTM index a list of 5 possible substances was found. The 4 incorrect matches were filtered out by comparing the a values as well as using the fact that the sample was a white powder with a simple cubic structure. Finally the intensities across all N values married up and so it was possible to identify sample 2 to be Sodium Chlorate, which has d values of  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . <heading>2.2.3 Higher Angle Scattering</heading>As mentioned in §1.1 measurement of the diffraction patterns for higher values of θ leads to greater accuracy (~0.1%) in the resultant lattice constant. At the high angle reflections the rings of the diffraction pattern separates into doublets with two different components, K α1 and K α2[3] Figure 5 shows the geometry of the situation. The diameter of the doublets, D, is equivalent to the angle  FORMULA  which is given by the following expression:  FORMULA  or  FORMULA  <figure/>These theta values for all visible doublet D measurements were plotted on a graph of  FORMULA  against N to find the integer N values associated with these Bragg angles. These were then substituted into equation 3 to find  FORMULA . These values were then plotted on a graph of  FORMULA  against an error function which is proportional to:  FORMULA  This error function tends to zero as  FORMULA  or when  FORMULA  where the beam is reflected back. This means that the a value is most accurate at  FORMULA  and so the y-intercept of the graph of a(N) against the error function provides the most accurate value for a. The  FORMULA  value used in equation 3 for each ring of the doublet refers to the wavelength of the wave originating from the copper source but, as mentioned above, the wave has separated into 2 components and so there are 2 corresponding  FORMULA  values that must be used depending on whether the result in question is the outer ring or the inner ring. For the copper source used in all sections of this experiment  FORMULA  - very strong  FORMULA  - strong [2] For doublets at higher angles the inner ring is as a result of  FORMULA  and the outer ring is due to  FORMULA . This is due to Bragg's Law where  FORMULA  is a function of  FORMULA  and so a larger wavelength will lead to a larger diffraction angle and so the ring will be further from the exit hole; hence making it the inner of the two rings (figure 6). <figure/>From figure 7 the y-intercept value was 6.579 with an error (given by Origin) of 0.037%.  FORMULA  which is in agreement with the value found in §2.2.1 to be  FORMULA . The error has also been improved from 0.219% down to 0.037%. <figure/><heading>2.3 Discussion</heading>Sample 2 was correctly identified to the extent that when the a value was put into the database there were very few possible matches. This may be an indication of the great deal of accuracy in determining a, although it may just be coincidence and merely that there are very few substances in the database with a values near to that of sodium chlorate. The high angle indexing proved highly successful, yielding a value with a particularly small error (0.037%). This was far below the required level of 0.1% and can be accredited to the wealth of doublet lines that were visible on the film that could be analysed. This value is also in agreement with that found in §3.2.1. Sample 1 was not successfully identified. The value for the lattice parameter was higher than the accepted value and so this may have lead to the inability to find the correct match in the list produced by the ASTM index. Further parameters did narrow down the list of possibilities, but not to the extent where it was possible to confidently identify the sample. This could be as a result of an unforeseen error in the calculations; leading to an underestimate of the error in a and so the error bounds were not large enough to include the accepted value. The main problem that was encountered was the lack of definition in the diffraction rings on the films. Some films were underexposed and so many of the maxima were not visible, leading to incorrect assumptions regarding the structure of the sample and problems when indexing. With the range of visible lines varying from 7 to 27 there were some instances where the structure was indeterminable and so the films had to be repeated. Other films were overexposed which then made the doublets more difficult to identify and measure. Another factor that may have contributed to the intensity problems was the vertical alignment of the sample in the camera. This was done by standing the tube in a lump of 'blu-tack' and prodding it until it appeared to be vertical and central on the stand. The camera was then sealed and moved into the x-ray machine with no opportunity to check the alignment of the sample again and so some external perturbation during that time may have caused the sample to precess or even move in and out of the x-ray beam, reducing the exposure time and therefore the intensity of the resulting diffraction patterns. The powdered sample may not have been sufficiently ground up and so the point at which the x-ray beam passed through the tube may have contained air gaps, which would have affected the pattern on the film and possibly lead to the larger a value. The method could be improved by using a camera with a better means of fixing the sample vertically in the centre of the beam so that the intensity was as good as possible. This would lead to a greater deal of clarity in the diffraction patters and hence provide more data to draw conclusions from. This improvement in intensity would also increase the definition of the rings, making them thinner and hence remove any possible ambiguity in where the measurement should be taken from and to. <heading>3. Part (b)</heading><heading>3.1 Experimental Detail</heading>A mixture of KBr and KCl was created with equal proportions with respect to their molecular masses using the following data: Total Mass, FORMULA  <table/>From these two values a ratio was formed:  FORMULA  (Equation 5)  FORMULA  (Equation 6) Combining equations 5 and 6 gives  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  By creating a 50:50 mix then according to Vegard's law the theoretical value for the lattice parameter was set at a point half way between the value of a KBr and a KCl. The mixture was heated until melting to form a liquid and then cooled to form a single compound. This was then ground up, inserted into the camera and exposed to the x-ray source in the same manner as samples 1 and 2 (see §2.1). <heading>3.2 Results</heading><heading>3.2.1 Finding a</heading>The diffraction pattern was analysed for the mixture (see §2.2.1i for method). 9 diffraction rings ( FORMULA  to  FORMULA ) were visible and these lines were indexed. Given that the two compounds that make up this mixed sample are both face-centred cubic, it is safe to assume that this sample will therefore also be a face-centred cubic structure. These N and  FORMULA  values were substituted in equation 3 and the relationship was plotted (see Figure 8). The relationship was not linear and so required adjustment to compensate for any maxima that might not have been visible on the film that may have lead to incorrectly indexed N values. By assuming that maxima are missing from the film before  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  and therefore translating the  FORMULA  values up one at these two points before mapping N values, a linear relationship became apparent. The line passes through the origin and therefore it can be assumed that this is the correct lattice type. <figure/>Using equation 3 again  FORMULA   FORMULA  The gradient of figure 8 was  FORMULA  FORMULA  and  FORMULA   FORMULA . (For error analysis refer to §2.1.2) <heading>3.2.2 Testing Vegard's Law</heading>The known values for the lattice constants of the 2 components of the mixed sample are  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . These two values along with the a value of the mixed sample, a mix, were plotted on a graph of lattice parameter against concentration of KBr in the sample (figure 9). <figure/>As shown in figure 9 the Vegard line passes through the area bound by the error bars of amix and so Vegard's Law holds true. <heading>3.3 Discussion</heading>Vegard's Law has been proven. For a compound with equal proportions of its two constituent substances, the lattice parameter is half way between the lattice parameters of the two substances that make up the mixture. A systematic error may have occurred in the mass measurement such as if the scales were not tared and instead under read the masses. Although this would affect all masses that were measured by adding Xgrams to the each mass measured, if taken as a proportion of the mass this would mean that the composition of KBr could be greater than 50% and so would translate the a mix point horizontally, moving it closer to the line. When the substances were combined by melting them in a test tube a small element of the glass may have also melted and combined with the substances. This would create a mixed sample with more than just KBr and KCl and so the theoretical a value would not lie on the line shown in figure 9. The experimental method could be improved by melting and forming the compound in a material with a much higher melting point than both KBr and KCl and so avoid any other unwanted contributions to the sample. <heading>4. Conclusion</heading>For sample 1 the lattice type was face-centred cubic and the lattice parameter was found to be  FORMULA  However it was not possible to identify the sample due to the fact that the lattice parameter was higher than the agreed value and so the true match did not appear in the list of possible substances in the ASTM index. When the ranges of as1 were increased to include the accepted value, the list of possible matches became too great to narrow down, even using other parameters such as colour and intensity patterns. For sample 2 the lattice type was simple cubic and the lattice parameter was found to be  FORMULA  which is in agreement with the accepted value. The sample was identified as sodium chlorate with the three lines of greatest intensity at  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  By analysis of high scattering angles, a more accurate value for a was obtained:  FORMULA  This result contained a considerably smaller error of 0.037% For the mixed sample the lattice parameter was  FORMULA  The line connecting the two known lattice parameters crossed the error bounds for this point and hence confirmed Vegard's Law.
