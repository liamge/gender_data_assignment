Chicken eggs are cheap, readily available and easily incubated. Mouse embryos need to be implanted into a mother to develop into full adults but, the large and robust chick embryos are accessible during all developmental stages when most of the important developmental decisions are being taken. This allows for a large variety of methodologies to be used to analyze the genetic regulation of many different developmental processes, such as surgical manipulation and tissue grafting. <figure/>The mouse makes a good genetic model because it is possible to create genetic knock-outs, removing the function of a gene by both forward and reverse genetics. Like with the chick the entire genomic sequence is known and the organism is easy to maintain and reproduced quickly. The disadvantage of using mice is that it is impossible to observe a developing embryo since it is buried deep within the mother's uterus, making it difficult to manipulate the mouse physically by tissue manipulation or the implantation of coated beads. The vertebrate limb consists of an asymmetrical distribution of parts, falling along three main axes all controlled by there own signalling centre. Three elements of the limb exist along the PD axis, the most proximal element is the stylopod followed by the zeugopod and finally the most distal element the autopod (figure 1). <picture/>Within the chick the first sign of limb formation is the thickening of the lateral plate mesoderm which eventually develops into limb buds that extend outwards producing differentiated cells that form the limb. This region of thickening is called the apical ectodermal ridge (AER); behind the ridge is the progression zone containing undifferentiated cells that will form the skeletal elements (figure 2). Posterior and proximal to the progression zone is the zone of polarising activity (ZPA) which is the primary source of signalling molecules that form the patterns along the AP axis (Niswander et al 1993). <figure/><heading>Formation of the Limb Buds</heading>Components of an FGF signalling cascade initiate the limb bud formation in vertebrates and cause the formation of the AER. FGF10 is the first FGF to be detected and is found in the mesenchyme of the limb forming region where it induces the production of FGF8 in the overlying ectoderm (Tickle and Munsterberg 2001). These two FGF's function to in a regulatory loop which induces the formation of and helps to maintains the AER. In the chick it has been shown that FGF10 is initially expressed across the segmental plate (SP), intermediate mesoderm (IM) and the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), but soon becomes restricted to the LPM. This restriction is partly due to the expression of other FGF factors such as FGF8, FGF4 and FGF2 which are produced in the somites and IM (Kawakami et al 2001). The restricted FGF10 protein signals to the surface ectoderm causing it to express FGF8, these ectoderm cells will form the AER and signal back to the IM via FGF8 to maintain the expression of FGF10, therefore completing the regulatory loop (Kawakami et al 2001). In FGF10 deficient mice embryos the limb bud does form but no out growth takes place, analysis by Sekine et al (1999) showed that neither the AER or the ZPA formed in these mice and no FGF8 expression was detected in the ectoderm, leading to the conclusion that FGF10 induces FGF8. The FGF loop is regulated by 3 molecular mediators in the form of Wnt genes that act through β-catenin pathways. FGF10 restriction is not only created via other FGF's but also by two WNT proteins expressed in the intermediate mesoderm (Takeuchi et al 2003), WNT2B (in the forelimb only) and WNT8C (in the hindlimbs). The action of these Wnt genes is essential for the maintenance of FGF10 in the limb buds (figure 3). <figure/>Wnt2b was added exogenously to flank LPM by Kawakami et al 2001 where it causes the formation of an ectopic limb, supporting the idea that it is required for the induction of Fgf10. The initiation and regulation of expression of Wnt2b and Wnt8c is mediated by the presence transcription factors from the T-box family, Tbx4 and Tbx5. Tbx4 is found only in the hindlimb bud where as Tbx5 is found expressed in the forelimb (figure 4). Tbx5 was first detected in prospective forelimb mesenchyme (Rallis et al 2003) before any limb outgrowth had begun, it is even expressed in Fgf10 knockout mice, showing that it is genetically upstream of Fgf10 expression. When Tbx5 is places onto the developing hindlimb it causes the production of wing like digits, when Tbx4 transcripts are placed on to the wing it causes the production of toe like digits and showing that these factors must play some role in limb specification (Rodrigues-Esteban et al 1999). Rallis et al (2003) created conditional knock-out mice where Tbx5 was not expressed in limb mesenchyme; the embryos they created showed a complete absence off all elements of the appendicular skeleton with disrupted shoulder and pelvis structure. A similar phenotype was observed in Fgf10 knock-out mice but not as severe indicating that Tbx5 has a broader influence on forelimb development and is upstream of Fgf10. <picture/><heading>Dorsal-Ventral patterning </heading>The D-V patterning in vertebrate limbs is controlled by the protein Lmx1b, a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in the dorsal mesenchyme (Riddle et al 1995). Missexpression of Lmx1b in ventral mesoderm causes the replacement of ventral structures with dorsal like structures, indicating that Lmx1b is a dorsalising factor (Rodrigues-Esteban et al 1997). It is induced by WNT7a a protein expressed in the dorsal ectoderm, but unlike other Wnt proteins discussed previously this one does not act via the β-catenin pathway (Kengaku et al 1998). Parr and McMahon (1995) created Wnt7a null mice and discovered that the offspring had a loss of posterior tissue in the limb bud and were missing most of the posterior digits; they also showed a ventralisation of the limbs with foot pads present on both the dorsal and ventral surfaces. <figure/>Wnt7a is restricted to the dorsal ectoderm by the transcription factor Engrailed1 (En1) and Dkk1, a Wnt antagonist (figure 5) (Adamska et al 2004). In the absence of En1, Wnt7a is missexpressed causing an expansion of the AER. In double knock-out mice En1-/- Wnt7a-/- there is no expansion of the AER (Loomis et al 1998) leading to the conclusion that the sole function of En1 is to restrict the transcription of Wnt7a to the ventral ectoderm. Engrailed1 is induced in the ventral ectoderm by BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signalling via a type 1 receptor (Bmpr1). Loss of BMP signalling leads to mice with phenotypes resembling En1 null mutants, with bi-dorsal limbs (Niswander 2003). <picture/>
