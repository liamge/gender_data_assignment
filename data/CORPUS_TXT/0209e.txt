The Commission: the "powerhouse" of Europe, "guardian of treaties," that legislates, mediates, administrates; realising the European dream. How can this political/administrative "hybrid" be rationalised against traditional establishments? EU institutions, apparently sui generis are transitional, never existing in a state of situ. They share power and cannot independently function without each other; each fighting to remain central to decision-making. The suggestion that the Commission's extensive competence is equivalent to a European government can be explored on many levels, from function and form, inter-institutional relationships, Commission presidency, to theories of European governance, Supernationalism or Intergovernmentalism. Does the Commission work for MS's, or is it an autonomous legal power with agenda-setting capacity? Why is such comparison necessary? Perhaps it underlines a larger crisis to which this discussion must be contextualised: a crisis of governance, legitimacy and identity, something that may be linked to the Commission's White paper on Governance. Described as a "government in waiting," what exactly is the Commission government of? <fnote>Michelle Cini, from "Understanding EU Institutions," edited by Alex Warliegh, 2002, 1st edition </fnote><fnote>Neil Nugent, The Commission, Palgrave Publishing, 2001 </fnote><fnote>Neil Nugent, The Commission, Palgrave Publishing, 2001 </fnote><fnote>Commissions white paper on "Governance in the EU," published in July 2001 (COM[2001]428 final) </fnote><fnote>Michelle Cini, from "Understanding EU Institutions," edited by Alex Warliegh, 2002, 1st edition </fnote>It is imperative to have a clear definition of government; does for example, difference exist between governance and leadership? Governance "means different things to different people." Therefore it is productive to assume an essentialist perspective of governance in European states: the "exercise of authority over a state or organisation, a system of ruling [or] political administration." It is usually formed from an elected group, legitimised with a democratic mandate, providing authority for leadership and decision-making over administrative, budgetary, military, social, fiscal and legal fields. Structurally, an "executive power enjoyed by a cabinet and prime minister" typically exists. "The executive governs...it comprises of...ministers and civil servants - who control...the state's instruments of coercion, wealth and information," primarily though law. Members are responsible for policy areas, directing a relevant department, usually part of an administration or civil service that realises policy. Governments are independent and autonomous with "power to form contractual relations," effectively seizing absolute control, albeit subject to constitutional restraint, the rule of law, or any check and balance procedures. Many European MS's have bicameral systems, where a second chamber (e.g. a senate) enforces accountability; indeed, democratic legitimisation and control of leadership appear as fundamental as its characteristic authority. <fnote>Ulrike Rub, European governance, views from the UK on democracy, participation and policy making in the EU, 2002 1st Edition </fnote><fnote>p192, Webster's Master English Dictionary, 2002 </fnote><fnote>Public Law, John McEldowney, Chapter 4, 3rd edition </fnote><fnote>p96, Public Law, John McEldowney, Chapter 4, 3rd edition </fnote><fnote>Public Law, John McEldowney, Chapter 4, 3rd edition </fnote>This discussions very existence illustrates the Commission's significance. I see two approaches: a presentation of for and against passages; or a commentary analysing arguments for each attribute compared to government. I have chosen the latter. The ECSC contains the Commission's origins, establishing a High Authority based on "supranational premises" to realise treaty provisions. Following the Rome Treaty, and after the first General Report the Commission name superseded. An "institutional balance" was foreseen with the Council of Ministers; shared power with other institutions. The Commission had three levels: the College of Commissioners chosen by MSs; the Commissioners personal advisors or cabinets; and the Directorate Generals, effectively the "ministries" of the EU. Its extensive decision-making jurisdiction was, for that very reason, broadly defined under treaty. Primary functions are the right of initiative; mediation; budgetary control; legislative/treaty supervision; and external representation. <fnote>European Coal and Steel Community, formed in April 1951 </fnote><fnote>Remco Vahl, Leadership in disguise, "The role of the European commission in EC decision making on agriculture in Uruguay Round" </fnote><fnote>First General report 1958 </fnote><fnote>Remco Vahl, Leadership in disguise, "The role of the European commission in EC decision making on agriculture in Uruguay Round" </fnote><fnote>Member States </fnote><fnote>Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote>A starting place for analysis may be the Commission's right to initiate legislation, an undeniable governmental characteristic attributing competence to execute policy. Article 155EC states: to "ensure proper functioning and development of the common-market" the Commission shall ensure enforcement of treaty measures, "formulate recommendations" it considers necessary, and "have its own power of decision." This discretion illustrates it may be more than a bureaucracy acting for MS's; it has a degree of autonomy. Article 189a provides exclusive right to create legislation, characteristic of governmental command. Whilst the Council (Article 208TEC) and EP (Article 192TEC) are involved in the legislative procedure, they cannot initiate or draft. The Commission must also produce recommendations, opinions, advice and proposals to the CoM; clearly indicating it's the centrality to decision-making and contribution to EU advancement. Once legislation is formally timetabled, it retains a "considerable measure of control:" "it is difficult for the Council or the EP to revise without Commission agreement." This is strengthened by article 189aEC: unanimity shall be required for the Council to amend Commission proposals, whereas the Commission can (providing the Council has not acted) alter or even withdraw proposals. This broad competence is not the stay of an administrator, but the will and power of an independent body representing European interests: the "conscience" of Europe, with its own agenda-setting capacity. Presuming otherwise ignores its "inherently political character." Treaties cannot predetermine every eventuality; consequently the Commission possesses delegated rule-making competence, placing it in "a similar position [to] national executives," enabling sole decision-making for administrative and technical law. Indeed, 4000 legislative instruments are issued yearly. "Opportunity exists to make not just administrative law, but what verges on policy," e.g. EU trade; illustrating a degree of self-determination and broad competence with "undeniable political implications."  <fnote>Article 155EC </fnote><fnote>Article 155EC </fnote><fnote>Article 155 EC Treaty </fnote><fnote>Article 155 EC Treaty </fnote><fnote>European Parliament </fnote><fnote>Council of Ministers </fnote><fnote>Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote><fnote>Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote><fnote>Remco Vahl, Leadership in disguise, "The role of the European commission in EC decision making on agriculture in Uruguay Round" </fnote><fnote>Michelle Cini, from "Understanding EU Institutions," edited by Alex Warliegh, 2002, 1st edition </fnote><fnote>Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote><fnote>Data sourced from Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote><fnote>Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote><fnote>Dinan, sourced from Remco Vahl, Leadership in disguise, "The role of the European commission in EC decision making on agriculture in Uruguay Round" </fnote>However these arguments must be contextualised. The right of initiative gives a central position, yet it is just that: central, but not at the beginning or end of decision-making processes. Despite discretionary powers; it merely works to a pre-defined programme. MS's determine treaties, the Commission draws policy from them: the agenda is preset. It "is not the formal and final EU decision-maker on major issues - the European Council, CoM and EP has greater power." EU institutions are designed so that they cannot effectively function independently. The Commission's legislative proposals can only be realised following EP or Council agreement. The EP, originally limited to non-binding opinions, now has a power of co-decision, effectively a veto that can be utilised after a proposal's second reading. Whilst the EP could appear as a second chamber in a potentially bicameral system, I would suggest its position and power are (with the Council) more central; it has a form of democratic mandate. The CoM can pressurise the Commission with opinions, resolutions, agreements, and recommendations; whilst Commission's right of initiative is not exclusive for FSP and JHA. The Council can demand studies or proposals, and its President may call meetings with the Commission at leisure. What government can be so directed? It is characteristic of system where institutions share power and importance, implying decision-making is a mediating process quite unlike conventional governance. This is essential to embody the broad interests presented by institutions representing different quarters, such as national MS's (Council); the electorate, political and interest groups (EP); or community ambitions (Commission). This exploration lies within deeper issues that can only be brushed upon: democratic legitimacy, defining Europe, and contentions between MS/EU politics. How can EU law be justified when synthesised by a single, undemocratic body so egotistical in its aspired power and esteem? The very essence of EU decision-making is mediation "between diverging nations' positions...looking for a consensus." The Commission is perfect for such a position: independent with right to initiate and amend. It is a "broker of interests," a "gatherer of research, information; [and] formulator of deals that are acceptable to the Council and EP," who legitimise the process. It has discretion and a degree of "policy control," but not government's autonomy. <fnote>Council of Ministers </fnote><fnote>Neil Nugent, The Commission, 2001, Palgrave Publishing </fnote><fnote>Article 189(b) EC Treaty </fnote><fnote>Council of Minister </fnote><fnote>Foreign Security Policy </fnote><fnote>Justice and Home Affairs </fnote><fnote>Article 152 EC Treaty </fnote><fnote>Article 147 EC Treaty </fnote><fnote>Remco Vahl, Leadership in disguise, "The role of the European commission in EC decision making on agriculture in Uruguay Round" </fnote><fnote>Mazey and Richardson 1994, sourced from an extract by Laura Cram, Developments in the EU, Edited Desmond Dinan and Neil Nugent, Macmillan Publishing / St. Martin's Press, 1st edition, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Extract by Laura Cram, Developments in the EU, Edited Desmond Dinan and Neil Nugent, Macmillan Publishing / St. Martin's Press, 1st edition, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Law of the European Community, Fairhurst and Vincenzi, 4th Edition </fnote>Responsibility exists for a variety of enforcement and supervisory powers in budgetary and legal fields, administered by the Commission bureaucracy and comparable to government derived enforcement agencies. It supervises legislative enforcement; protects treaties; and even has limited direct implementation of competition policy, governing cross-broader mergers. It functions as a watchdog, perhaps similar to agencies like Customs. In association with the ECJ, obligation exists to bring actions against MS's or private individuals breaching EU law to which it has a debateable degree of discretion, reinforcing notions of a self-determining conscience. It is not "monolithic," but a multi-levelled, multi-tasking and "highly developed bureaucracy;" supported by a rapidly "emerging network of regulatory agencies" synonymous with the development governmental authority. Yet despite extensive competence, it is restricted by insufficient resources. Although issuing 1000 formal notices annually, "it lacks the resources to detect and fight all breaches." Its relatively small size (21,000 workers - comparable to a city council) and paltry funds mean it lacks strength to be an effective government let alone an effective administration, despite its ambitious nature. <fnote>UK Customs and Excise </fnote><fnote>European Court of Justice </fnote><fnote>Under Article 226 EC </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Idea from Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Remco Vahl, Leadership in disguise, "The role of the European commission in EC decision making on agriculture in Uruguay Round" </fnote><fnote>Idea and data sourced from Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote>It supervises the budget, overseeing income collection. Whilst characteristic of government, control is much "weaker:" the EP pre-agrees the budget; the Council and EP control the upper-revenue base; and it cannot make decisions independently, e.g. raise the VAT ceiling to prevent deficit. It is dependent on the EP and Council to legitimise and authorise: power is shared. Practically, collection occurs through national agencies who "execute 80% of the budget," limiting ground-level authority. Independent financial control is typical of governance; the Commission lacks this element of autonomy. Whilst it is an external representative (e.g. WTO) with "important negotiating and managing responsibilities" (resembling government), this is only after consensus with the Council and EP, demonstrating joint decision-making. <fnote>Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote><fnote>Example drawn from Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote><fnote>Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote><fnote>Under Article 133 TEC </fnote><fnote>Remco Vahl, Leadership in disguise, "The role of the European commission in EC decision making on agriculture in Uruguay Round" </fnote>Structurally the Commission is organised "much like domestic governments." At the "apex" is the College, a core executive analogous to cabinet government, chaired by the Commission President. Each commissioner performs roles like cabinet ministers, responsible for portfolios governing policy areas, e.g. trade. Collective responsibility exists like government: when majority decisions are made, all "must toe the line." Commissioners' cabinets imitate the French government system. They have four functions: as policy advisors to balance opinion against advice from the DG; to improve inter-commissioner organization and dispute resolution; supervise DG's work responsible to the Commission; and to function as "political antennae...for party and interest group demands." Commissioners should completely independent, a characteristic from Monnet's vision of an "apolitical functionalist bureaucracy" focusing on European interests; consequently aspiring to be more than a body employed by MS's. Realistically Commissioners are compromised, expected to be partisan actors to their own MS's. The Commission bureaucracy is divided into twelve DG's. The structure emulates governmental systems with corresponding roles and functions. The equivalent of government ministries, they develop policy, organise legislation, allocate revenue, support the executive and observe legislative compliance. Each is responsible for policy initiation in specific regions, "aligned with the competences of the Commissioner." It is equivalent to a government civil service. The Commission has also spawned a network of "quasi-autonomous agencies" fulfilling regulatory functions, for the Commission is charged with the union's everyday running. Its use of executive instruments is a common feature of government, e.g. the French 'ordonnances' or German 'rechtsverordnungen." Whilst organisation appears directly parallel, it is a noteworthy but weak form of assessment. Examining its functionality is more useful. In terms of initiating legislation the Commission operates like government, with specialist departments drafting in relevant DGs. Proposals are then passed through the Chefs de Cabinets, may be revised, and then forwarded to the College who can do as they please with suggestions. <fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Idea sourced from Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Ideas sourced from Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Directorate-General </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Under Article 213 EU Treaty </fnote><fnote>Monnet's Concept, drawn from Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Directorate Generals </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Ideas sourced from Neil Nugent, Government and politics of the EU, 8th edition, 2003 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Idea sourced from Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote>Despite similarities, Commissioners appear as "more than permanent secretaries but less than ministers" in a "curious halfway position." Whilst spokesperson for their policy, they are not part of the CoM where decisions are made with the EP. Subsequently, the direct representation and open accountability so characteristic of government is inexistent. The customary individual responsibility, present in all governments is "difficult to apply to the Commission." Democratically, and as the Commission's White paper advocates, effective governance should always be transparent and tangible; the Commission is not such a 'government.' If original treaty provisions are considered, accountability becomes less vital: decisions are taken, and should be taken at a higher level through the more democratic, transparent Council and EP. Despite the SG promoting co-ordination, the Commission functions in a "compartmentised manner," within a "rigid framework" that restricts "integrated approaches." Hence decision-making lacks the co-ordinated and inclusive approach of an autonomous government following an objective or ideology, it is more similar to a bureaucracy/administration realising a pre-determined programme of development. "Independence from national control is undermined by the power of cabinets," who are keen to represent MS interests. It signifies a "reluctance of MS's to ensure that the Commission is truly independent and well resourced," perhaps suggesting their fear of its ambitious nature and growing strength beyond traditional parameters. Resultantly, the Commission is more intergovernmental, rather than the supranational functionality a true government would adopt. The Comitology system, established by Council decision, creates three committees: advisory, management and regulatory, restricting Commission ability to mould policy. It characterises the power struggle between institutions, and limitations placed upon Commission development to prevent it becoming over-centralised, by increasing decision-making involvement. It is not envisaged to be the sole decision-maker. Indeed, it provides a "separation of powers so that the final legislators can scrutinise the executive," increasing those within decision-making processes, including "national officials, sub-national authorities and private actors."  <fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Commissions white paper on "Governance in the EU," published in July 2001 (COM[2001]428 final) </fnote><fnote>Secretariat General </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Donnelly and Richardson 1994, sourced from Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Council Decision 87/373/EEC in 1986 following the SEA 1987 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote>The Commission presidency attracts much attention, influencing Commission aspirations and inter-institutional relationships. They prepare the annual work-programme, structuring the community agenda. Whilst appearing as an element of autonomy, it is merely to realise treaty ambitions. Under the ToA the President has powers to veto MS Commissioner nominations, and a responsibility to provide political leadership. Functionally they are akin to a head of government and participate in debates and G7. Increased prominence originates from the strength of Delors'  presidency, who concentrated power, making it more of a political leadership. Prodi's presidency adopted the same objectives, seeking to make the Commission more esteemed and effectual. He openly acknowledged ambitions to create a "European government," designating himself a "virtual Prime Minister;" strengthening the cabinet system, replicating government. The president can provide a strong sense of direction, although of course within discussed parameters of the Commission. The institutions are "constantly re-aligning themselves in inter-institutional terms;" the last decade has seen attempts to re-balance authority. The Commission has not welcomed unfavourable adjustments with equanimity, guarding "its exclusive right of initiative against attempts by the EP...to adapt it." During TEU negotiations it withdrew after calls for QMV, potentially restricting its authority. It perhaps illustrates its true temperament: a power hungry, "oversized Brussels's bureaucracy." 2004 witnessed such re-adjustment as the proposed Commission was rejected. The underlying difficulty of a Commission as government is democratic legitimacy. It may argued that it is democratic: the administrative is detached from the electoral; Commission/EP terms coincide; inter-institutional consultation exists; and Commissioners and DG workers give evidence to the European Parliament. Nonetheless, when compared to conventional governance, it appears undemocratic. <fnote>Treaty of Amersterdam </fnote><fnote>G7: Group 7 - Top 7 Most industrialised countries who meet at a forum </fnote><fnote>From 1985-1995 </fnote><fnote>From 2000 </fnote><fnote>Maria, Green Coubs and Michael Smith, "The state of the EU," Risks, reform, resistance and revival, OUP 2001 </fnote><fnote>Maria, Green Coubs and Michael Smith, "The state of the EU," Risks, reform, resistance and revival, OUP 2001 </fnote><fnote>David Judge and David Earnshaw, The European Parliament, The EU series (General Editors: Nugent, Paterson, Wright) Palgrave / Macmillan publishing, 1st edition, 2003 </fnote><fnote>Remco Vahl, Leadership in disguise, "The role of the European commission in EC decision making on agriculture in Uruguay Round" </fnote><fnote>Negotiations on the Treaty of the European Union in 1991 </fnote><fnote>Qualified Majority Voting </fnote><fnote>Professor Anand Menon, "Still leading from the wings?

Established conceptions are inadequate; it is sui generis. It executes governmental functions through comparable legislative, administrative, and regulatory systems. Its competence, discretion and enforcement capacity indicate it is more than a conventional administration. It is the nanny of the Union that wishes it were her own child: supervising, guiding, protecting. It is a "highly developed bureaucracy" like no other; a quasi-autonomous, executive "that oils the wheels" of decision-making. Whilst I cannot doubt its influence; or soaring aspirations, (often exemplified by its President, or realised through the elasticity of inter-institutional relations) it traces a largely predetermined programme. Decisions are principally made in agreement with other institutions; its powers and competence spawn from shared authority, as does its subsequent legitimacy. True governance "presupposes a body made up of independent persons, with independent financial resources and significant, autonomous decision-making powers." EU governance is a story of co-decision and mediation, the Commission can only write part of this narrative. It is undemocratic, fragmented, with little collective political ideology or will, having presently reached its apex. It is a "source of leadership," not governance. Governance debates are emblematic of a deeper crisis. Enlargement and the Constitution represent a new era. If the Union becomes more state-like, more federal, the source of governance becomes increasingly important. The EU is "model of different systems of governance." At some point a more unified, centralist and participatory leadership must be created. Without democratic legitimacy, it will not be the Commission. <fnote>Michelle Cini, from "Understanding EU Institutions," edited by Alex Warliegh, 2002, 1st edition </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Simon Hix, Political systems of the EU, 1999 </fnote><fnote>Coombes (1970), sourced from Remco Vahl, Leadership in disguise, "The role of the European commission in EC decision making on agriculture in Uruguay Round" </fnote><fnote>Remco Vahl, Leadership in disguise, "The role of the European commission in EC decision making on agriculture in Uruguay Round" </fnote><fnote>Professor John McEldowney, Lecturer in Constitutional and Administrative Law at University of , Lectures on EU law 2004 </fnote><fnote>Idea from Lecture sessions by Professor John McEldowney, Lecturer in Constitutional and Administrative Law at University of , 2004 </fnote>
