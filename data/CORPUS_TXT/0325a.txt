He is well-known for his conditions on functions in order for such series to converge accordingly. In order to make his ultimate claim on the limits of trigonometric series he began by proving the following theorem: <heading>Theorem 1</heading>For a function  FORMULA  that is monotonic and continuous for  FORMULA  with  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA . <heading>Proof</heading>Let  FORMULA  be monotonic and decreasing on  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . Consider  FORMULA . We will refer to this as  FORMULA . Let us divide this integral so that its limits are as follows:  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA , where  FORMULA  is the greatest multiple of  FORMULA  less than h. Integrals are alternately positive and negative since  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  (as each  FORMULA ), yet  FORMULA  alternates in sign with each integral. Also, each integral has a smaller value than its preceding one:  FORMULA  is decreasing  FORMULA  each  FORMULA  decreases as k increases;  FORMULA  is increasing on  FORMULA  is decreasing  FORMULA  each  FORMULA  decreases as k increases  FORMULA  each  FORMULA  decreases as k increases. Consider  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  and let  FORMULA . When  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  constant,  FORMULA  is equivalent to  FORMULA  since f is decreasing on each interval. Let  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  as  FORMULA . We know  FORMULA . Split up this integral so the limits are  FORMULA ,  FORMULA , ... and denote the absolute value of each integral by  FORMULA , e.g.  FORMULA . Each  FORMULA  is alternately positive and negative, thus  FORMULA  as  FORMULA . Denote the sum of the first n terms by  FORMULA , i.e.  FORMULA . Regarding  FORMULA  we can choose an  FORMULA  s.t. as k increases the number of integrals this splits into increases, and eventually  FORMULA , i.e. as  FORMULA ,  FORMULA  . Divide this integral into two: i) the first m integrals; ii) all integrals thereafter. As  FORMULA , each  FORMULA  (consider  FORMULA ) and  FORMULA  respectively. Thus  FORMULA , i.e.  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA . By induction  FORMULA , i.e.  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA , where  FORMULA . It is clear that  FORMULA  FORMULA . Combine these results to get  FORMULA . Choose an m s.t.  FORMULA  becomes negligible. We now have that  FORMULA  as  FORMULA  as required. Now let  FORMULA  on  FORMULA . As in 1) each  FORMULA  decreases as k increases, and  FORMULA  as  FORMULA . If follows that if  FORMULA , c being some constant,  FORMULA  as  FORMULA . Suppose  FORMULA  is monotonic and decreasing on  FORMULA  but it is not necessary that  FORMULA .  FORMULA  s.t.  FORMULA  as  FORMULA .  FORMULA  as  FORMULA . Finally suppose  FORMULA  is monotonic and increasing on  FORMULA . Then  FORMULA  is as in 3)  FORMULA  as  FORMULA . This covers all cases and so the theorem is proved. ■ Now consider g s.t.  FORMULA . By Theorem 1 we have that  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  as  FORMULA . Taking the difference of these we get  FORMULA  as  FORMULA . For consistency with Dirichlet's paper we will refer to this result as Theorem 2. Note that if f is not continuous at g or h then we replace  FORMULA  with  FORMULA . Dirichlet continued with an attempt to find the limit of what we recognise today as the general Fourier series expansion of  FORMULA . Let us consider the first  FORMULA  terms  FORMULA  to see what happens as  FORMULA  this can be written as: <fnote>Fourier series </fnote> FORMULA . We split this integral into two (and temporarily disregard the  FORMULA ) as follows:  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA  in the first integral and  FORMULA  in the second. Solving for  FORMULA  to find limits we have:  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . Let us consider the second of these integrals. Since  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Let  FORMULA , i.e.  FORMULA . It is clear the integral will be equal to 0. Suppose  FORMULA , i.e.  FORMULA . Note  FORMULA  can have breaks in continuity, say at  FORMULA . Divide the integral so its limits are now  FORMULA . This satisfies the conditions of Theorem 2, thus  FORMULA  (due to the breaks in continuity of  FORMULA  and since  FORMULA  is arbitrarily small); all subsequent integrals converge to zero. Now suppose  FORMULA , i.e.  FORMULA . Divide the integral into two as follows:  FORMULA  and  FORMULA . The first of these integrals converges to  FORMULA  by Theorem 1. Let  FORMULA  in the second integral. Solving for  FORMULA  to find limits we obtain  FORMULA . When  FORMULA , i.e. when  FORMULA  this integral will converge to  FORMULA , otherwise the integral tends to zero. To summarise:  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA .  FORMULA  is analogous to the integral we have just considered:  FORMULA ,  FORMULA ,  FORMULA . Putting these two integrals together, we have that the Fourier series converges to  FORMULA  when  FORMULA  (remembering to factor in ), and  FORMULA  when  FORMULA . Note that breaks in continuity of  FORMULA  cannot be consecutive by the nature of integrals, and if  FORMULA  has no breaks in continuity the Fourier series is equal to  FORMULA  when  FORMULA . Early analysis of what we know today as Fourier series had been made by Jakob and Johann Bernoulli in the early 1700s, and later by mathematicians such as Euler and Lagrange. Joseph Fourier claimed that any function could be represented by a series of sines of multiples of the variable. Johann Dirichlet made his reputation with his first published paper on his work on Fermat's theorem. He subsequently became acquainted with many other mathematicians, notably Joseph Fourier. Dirichlet was particularly interested in Fourier's work in mathematical physics, especially his theory of heat. This was perhaps the origin of his interests in Fourier series.  <fnote> URL  </fnote><fnote>Mémoire sur l'impossibilité de quelques equations indeterminées du cinquième degré </fnote><fnote>Dunnington [1938] pp 173 </fnote>Although Fourier himself had used these series to solve differential equations, he failed to provide a thorough explanation of them due to the absence of precise definitions of a function and an integral during his time. At the time it was hardly considered that a series could not be integrated term by term, so Fourier series was the only trigonometric series used for representing a function. The question was, did it converge? As far as Dirichlet was aware the only paper to have been written on the subject of the convergence of Fourier series was by Cauchy in 1826. Riemann, Dirichlet's student, claimed that Dirichlet was the first to have written a thorough account on the subject. <fnote> URL  </fnote><fnote>Cooke [1997] pp 380 </fnote><fnote> URL  </fnote>Cauchy shows in his [1826] how Poisson's work on convergence had been non-rigorous, though ironically Dirichlet shows in his [1829] that Cauchy had also made an error: Cauchy took a convergent series, transformed it by means of complex function theory and resulted in the claim that the sum of a series of continuous functions is itself continuous. We see in Dirichlet's paper that Dirichlet dismisses the notion of using complex numbers in this problem, and finds a counter example to Cauchy's theorem. What is more is that Dirichlet upturns the problem by initially taking a function and proving that the Fourier series converges to it. <fnote>Cooke [1997] pp 380 </fnote>Aside from inspiration from Fourier, it seems that he recognised the value in doing mathematics at an abstract level without any application to the 'real world'. Rather than get stuck in formulae and long calculations "he preferred to clarify theorems on an intuitive or lower level, to analyse the foundations logically, and to avoid calculations as long as possible." In [1829] Dirichlet only proves the nature of convergence of Fourier series for monotonic functions. However, these conditions won Dirichlet his fame regarding the work of Fourier series, paving the way for future mathematicians to continue in the same direction. Riemann was later to become interested in the necessary conditions for a function to be represented by a Fourier series, leading to what we know today as the Riemann integral and the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma. <fnote>Dunnington [1938] pp 180 </fnote><fnote> URL  </fnote> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA
