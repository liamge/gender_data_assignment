The subject details and experiment conditions are shown below. <table/><heading>Results</heading><heading>Part A: Measuring lung volumes with the Spirometer</heading>The volume of gas inspired and expired was measured by the Spirometer and recorded by the kymograph. The kymograph drum was moving at speed 0.28cms -1. The x-axis of spirograph represents time and the y-axis represents the movement of Spirometer. Volume of gas inspired or expired can be calculated using the formula below:  FORMULA  Example:  FORMULA  Conversion of data form ambient temperature saturated conditions (ATPS) to the body temperature pressure saturated conditions (BTPS)  FORMULA   FORMULA  Residual volume can be calculated using the formula below: Females:  FORMULA  Lung volumes are calculated and shown in table 1. <table/><heading>Part B: test of respiratory function with the Vitalograph</heading><table/><heading>Part C: Oxygen consumption and Metabolic Rate </heading> FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  <heading>Discussion</heading><heading>Part A: Measuring lung volumes with the Spirometer</heading>A closed circuit Spirometer is used in this experiment. The Spirometer is filled with air and subject breath through the mouth piece. Valves are presents in the tube ensuring that gas only travel one-way. Expired air passed through a soda lime carbon dioxide absorber before it enters the Spirometer. It is very important to keep the carbon dioxide content low in the gas in Spirometer. High carbon dioxide content in Spirometer gas will suppress the rate of diffusion of carbon dioxide form the alveolar capillaries to the alveolar space, leaving a high partial pressure of carbon dioxide in subject's blood. The high [HCO 3-] in circulation lowers the blood pH and the subject will experience acidosis. Therefore, it is very important to keep the carbon dioxide content in Spirometer low or similar to natural exciting value (partial pressure of carbon dioxide under barometric pressure = 0.3mmHg). As majority of carbon dioxide expired is absorbed by the soda lime filter, the total gas volume in the Spirometer decreases with time. It is demonstrated in the spirograph that the trace tends to rise with time. The total carbon dioxide production is approximately equal to the decrease in volume of the gas chamber in Spriometer. The rate of carbon dioxide production is equivalent to the slope of Spirograph trace. The result shows that subject have a relatively larger total lung capacity and residual volume comparing with the average value in the same age and sex group. Subject has a larger tidal volume and smaller Inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume compare to the average value. These indicate that subject is breathing deeper than normal people, and this is related to the muscular training of the subject. Subject is an active choir member and she had regular training for more than ten years. Those training strengthen the elastic fibres and so they are able overcome the compliance of lungs allowing the lungs to inflate and deflate at a faster rate. <heading>Part B: Test of Respiratory Function with the Vitalograph</heading>Spirometry is one of the major primary diagnoses of pulmonary functions; the trace of graph provides an assessment of the degree and the kind of lung abnormalities. Lung disease can be divided in two categories: restrictive and obstractive lung diseases. Restrictive lung disease patients experience a restricted inspiration, patients will find more difficult to get air into the lungs, examples include: fibrosis, sarcoidosis, muscular diseases, and chestwall deformities. Obstructive lung disease patient find more difficult to get air out of the lungs, example include: emphysema, chronic bronchitis and asthma. Restrictive and obstructive lung diseases are characterized by the change of lung volumes, data is shown below: (Figure. 3) <figure/><list>Restrictive Disease: Decreased VC; decreased TLC, RV, FRCObstructive Disease: Decreased VC; increased TLC, RV, FRC. </list>The vitrograph provide an easy approach for the detection of obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. In a normal individual, the percentage of forced vital capacity that is expired in the first second (FEV 1/FVC %) is about 80%. However, for patient suffering form obstructive lung disease, the FEV 1/FVC% value may decrease to only 47%. In serious airway obstruction, as often occurs in acute asthma, FEV 1/FVC% value can decrease to less than 20%. The vitrograph is a good guideline for the primary confirmation of the obstructive and restrictive lung disease. Characterized change of FEV 1,FVC and FEV 1/FVC% is shown in the graph below. <figure/><list>Restrictive Disease: Decreased FEV1 and FEV1/FVC% ; decreased or normal FVCObstructive Disease: : Decreased or normal FEV1 , decreased FVC and normal or increasedFEV1/FVC%</list>My FEV 1/FVC % was 74.5% and my FVC was very close my total lung capacity, this indicates that there may be a small obstruction of my airway. However, this may also link to the errors due to leakage of gas; more repeats can be done to give a more precise measurement. <heading>Part C: Oxygen Consumption and Metabolic Rate</heading>My metabolic rate was 44.2 Kcal m-2 hr-1, it is slightly higher than the average basal metabolic rate of my age group. There are number of factors affecting the metabolic rate such as exercise, occupation and specific dynamic action of protein. Exercising can cause a dynamic increase of metabolic rate. A well- trained athlete can raise his metabolic rate to 2000 % of normal. Also, the types of work you doing vary the energy requirements and therefore have an affect of the metabolic rate. Furthermore, after a meal is ingested, the metabolic rate increases. It is mainly results form the effect of directly stimulating the cellular chemical process of certain of the amino acid derived form the proteins of ingested food. My high metabolic rate was possibly due to the meal I had approximately two hours before the experiment. Also, people who perform regular exercise or sports tend to have a higher metabolic rate.
