The sign of any outstanding and lasting design is its recognition. One of the most easily recognised designs of the 20 th Century is the Coca-Cola bottle, which almost anyone would recognise regardless of age, nationality or gender. I will now look at the origins of this design and consider why it is so successful. When Coca-Cola first started bottling their drinks they used a simple rounded bottle of equal radius throughout, known as the Hutchison Bottle, as was common with beverages of the time (left). Its stopper worked either by using a marble or a stiff wire look and a rubber disk, whereby the pressure inside the bottle forced the disk or marble right to the top of the bottle where it acted as a seal and its own pressure prevented it form leaking (right). It could be released by pushing the marble down or twisting the wire and letting the pressure out. However, they found that this bottle and its sealing mechanism were inefficient, costly and liable to leak and break. <picture/><picture/>Coca-Cola then realized the importance of shape in their bottle designs: they realized that a consumer, on reaching into a bucket of ice, would not be able to tell the Coca-Cola bottle from any other bottle just by touch, and so would grab whichever bottle came to hand first. It was clear that Coca-Cola had to make their bottle a distinctive shape if it was to be recognized and selected out over other bottles. It is then that the initial idea for the Coca-Cola bottle as we know it today first appeared. The original design was based on the cocoa pod (left) from which Coca-Cola is made which was both distinctive and easy to hold. The resulted in what was called the Root Bottle (right). <picture/>b/p This design of bottle was the true beginning of Coca-Cola's success: it was distinctive, unusual, modern and it spread throughout the world very fast. The increased use of the crown cap (as is commonly seen on almost all bottled beers and soft drinks still today) made transportation of Coca-Cola's bottles easier too. <picture/>However, the bulky shape of Coca-Cola's bottles still hampered transportation a little; the Hutchison bottle was well equipped for traveling as many bottles could be fitted in a box without much wasted space. Coca-Cola therefore decided to slim down their bottles to the shape we see them today: <picture/>This shape of bottle is thinner and so many of them can be packed together in a smaller space, but it still maintains the unique shape derived from the cocoa pod that was its inspiration. There are possibly other points that make this improved bottle shape more appealing. One positive aspect of a thinner bottle is possibly its similarities to the female form: it is curvaceous and yet slim, which epitomises the 20 th Century desirable shape of women. The bottle has both a "neck" and a "waist", and although this may seem to be a somewhat specious comparison, it does represent a great deal about Coca-Cola and their image of up-to-the-minute fashion and desirability. <picture/>Due to the distinctive design of the Coca-Cola bottle, it has been available for advertising itself merely as distinctive. It has resulted in a whole troop of collectors worldwide, and itself has become a collector's item. It is possible to buy Gold Plated, solid silver, chocolate, giant and miniature Coca-Cola bottles, and the bottle itself has largely spawned the overall popularity of the drink and the recognition of the Coca-Cola logo which can be seen throughout the world. It is a fine example of what clever aesthetic designing can do for a product, and interesting to see how the design of possibly the most famous item and logo throughout the world has come into being.
