<heading>a) What are the advantages of having the lookout in the crows nest as opposed to on the deck of the ship? </heading>The distance to the horizon is an upper limit to how far away it is physically possible to see. An observer cannot look much far from the deck of the ship as he/she could from the crows nest. You can have the best view of the approaching hazards, other ships or land from the crows nest. <heading>b) Construct a mathematical model to show how far a lookout can see. Clearly indicate any assumptions you make and define any parameters you use in your formula and in the construction of your model. </heading><picture/><list>C is the centre of the earth.S is the surface of the earth.r is the radius of the earthh is the height of the observer's eyes above the surface of the earth.d is the distance from the observer's eyes to the horizon.l is the distance from the observe to the horizon along the curve of the earth.a is the angle between the observer and the horizon, measured from the centre of the earth.</list><heading>Assumptions:</heading>We assume no refraction, without refraction we can see farther away. Horizon is the point on the world's surface at which the line of sight of the viewer, whatever their height, becomes parallel to the surface of the world and then meets the surface of the world. We also assume a perfectly spherical world and the horizon you are looking at is at sea level. I am going to use the Pythagoras's theorem on the right angled-triangle to calculate the distance from the observer to the horizon. The triangle is a right-angled one, whose sides are the radius of the planet, the radius of the planet plus the height of the observer, and the distance to the horizon. For a right-angled triangle:  FORMULA  c is the longest side (h+r) a and b are the other sides (d and r)  FORMULA  Re-arranged the equation gives  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  The total distance to the horizon is given by:  FORMULA  If the approximation, d, is not sufficient then a more accurate distance can be calculated (l).  FORMULA   FORMULA  So,  FORMULA  The arc of the circle l has a length l = r x ÔÅ± So the substitute the above equation into this we get:  FORMULA  <heading>C) you are given that the eye-level of a typical on deck lookout is 1.75m above deck level, the floor of the crow's nest is 25m above deck level and the deck itself is 5m above (flat) sea level. The radius of the earth can be taken as 6300 kilometers. </heading><heading>For deck of ship</heading>Radius of earth: 6300 km height= (typical eye level)1.75+ (deck above the sea level) 5 =6.75 m Converting meters into kilometers  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  d = 9.2 km <heading>For crows nest:</heading>Floor of the deck is 25m above the sea level The deck itself is 5 m above the sea level So height= 25+5=30m Converting meter into kilometers we get:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  d = 19.4 km From the calculation, we can conclude that we can see much far from the crows nest compare to the deck of the ship. For the deck of the ship the height is 6.75m and an observer can see up to 9.2 km far whereas the height for the crows nest is 30m and an observer can see 19.4 km far. It means you can see (19.4-9.2=10.2) up to the double distance from the crows nest compare to the deck of the ship.
