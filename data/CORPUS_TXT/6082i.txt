<heading>Experiment 5a - Ascorbic Acid Saturation Test</heading><heading>Introduction and Aim</heading>To measure the total ascorbic acid excreted of a subject over the collection period of three hours, by saturation test that measures total ascorbate (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid) concentration in the urine collected. Light absorbance, measured by a spectrophotometer, is an indicator of ascorbate concentration. <heading>Results</heading>Total urine volume = 478.0 ml <table/>See Fig. 1 - Line of best fit showing light absorbencies against different ascorbic acid concentrations <heading>Discussion</heading>From Table 1, the urine absorbance is the closest (difference of 0.02 µg/ml) to the absorbance of 60 µg/ml ascorbate. This suggests that the ascorbate concentration of the urine sample is more or less above 60 µg/ml. This is ensured according to Fig. 1, with the mean light absorbance of urine sample at 0.784, it has concentration of 77µg/ml ascorbate. Therefore the total ascorbic acid excreted over the collection period: <heading>Conclusion</heading>The recovery dose of ascorbate in the urine should be 60 to 80% of subjects with normal tissue saturation. As there is a total of 36 806 µg excreted by the subject over the three-hour collection period, which is about 67 times more than ingested. Therefore the subject has an adequate intake of ascorbic acid. <heading>Experiment 5b - Assessment of Nutritional Status Workshop</heading><heading>5.2 - Anthropometry (all data is of a group member)</heading><heading>5.2.1. - Height, Weight and Circumferences</heading><table/><heading>Limitations of a BMI measurement</heading>BMI is a reliable total body fat indicator (only weight and height are taken into account), but its limitations are: It does not apply to everyone i.e. it may over-estimate body fat in athletes and others who are muscular, who might have BMI value over 25 but very little body fat; It may under-estimate body fat in older people and those have lost muscle mass, thus a higher body fat proportion. These happen even the individuals are in the normal weights range for their heights. There is potential of underreport when the subject records the measurements himself. It is less reliable for individuals e.g. with rather rapid change in weight and extremes of height, also for children with are rapid growth. Different and specific ranges of BMI values are adapted for different races. Useful factors such as sex, age, body size, body shape (frame) and body composition are neglected. In general, men are more muscular than women. <heading>Waist: Hip Ratio</heading>It does not show the fat distribution of the whole body, but only indicates the fat distribution in waist and hip areas, thus to indicate whether the subject has an apple- or pear- body shape. <heading>5.2.2. Skinfold Measurements</heading><table/><heading>Reproducibility </heading>The spread of the five measurements can be shown by calculating the standard deviation:  FORMULA  The data has a standard deviation of ± 0.867mm and ranging from 16.8 mm to 19.2 mm, hence a difference of 2.4 mm. This is because training and practice are required to avoid intra- and inter-observer errors. From the values, although there is a low consistency and reproducibility of the measurements, the body fat values shown from the skinfold measurement and the Bioelectrical Impedance (see p. 4) match (see Tables 5.2, 5.3 - grey boxes): same body fat percentage (28.3%) and 0.2 kg difference in fat mass. <heading>Improvement</heading>If it is not always possible for a trained and experienced person to take the measurement, at least the same person should make the skinfold measurement to minimise errors. It is preferred to measure at the four standard skinfold sites: triceps, biceps, subscapular and surprailiac, instead of triceps only. To repeat measuring (more than five times) as many time as possible under time available. This increases the reliability of the data. <heading>Making measurements at 4 sites rather than triceps only</heading><list><heading>Advantages</heading>This would give a more complete body composition and subcutaneous fat.Also a better indication of body fat deposit</list><list><heading>Disadvantages</heading>The more measurements made, the more variations of the dataMore time consumingGreater level of cooperation of subject neededMore essential to have a trained observer make the measurements in order to get consistent data</list><heading>5.2.3. Bioelectrical Impedance</heading><table/>The body fat measurements by skinfolds are almost the same as those measured by bioelectrical impedance.
