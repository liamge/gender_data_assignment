<abstract><heading>Summary</heading>The Objective of the experiment was to use the given apparatus to measure the experimental value of the moment of inertia of various discs using suitable measurements & graphs and finally comparing it with the theoretical values. The Apparatus consisted of a wooden plate with a drum with a helical groove on one side and a disc holder n the other side. There was a string attached to the drum and the string could be wound around the groove. The other side of the string had a lasso which could be used to suspend weights. A disc was attached to the holder and various weights were suspended on it. They were allowed to fall from the maximum possible height and the time they took to fall to the ground was measured using a stopwatch. This process was performed on two different discs with different radii. Then a graph was plotted between the mass suspended against the reciprocal of the square of the time taken to fall to the ground. The slope of the line of best fit obtained in the graph was used experimental value of the moment of inertia of the disc using Newton's equations of motion. This value was then compared with the theoretical value of moment of inertia obtained using the Formula  FORMULA  The experimental error was then judged using the difference in the values obtained. The percentage error was found to be very high and hence I personally don't think that this method can effectively measure the moment of inertia of the discs. </abstract><heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>The Purpose of the experiment was to analyse and judge the accuracy of the experimental measurement of the moment of inertia of a disc using the given apparatus. <heading>THEORY</heading>The word INERTIA is defined as the inability of a body to change by itself its state of rest or of uniform motion which is an effect of its mass or can be considered as the mass itself. The rotational equivalent of this inertia is called the moment of inertia or the second moment of mass. The expression for the moment of inertia can be derived as follows. The Linear velocity of a body (v) is the product of the radius or distance from the axis of rotation (r) and the angular velocity (w).  FORMULA  The kinetic energy of this rotating object is hence  FORMULA  The total kinetic energy in the body is the sum of the individual energy of all the particles contained in it.  FORMULA  Looking at this equation in a rotational context, the angular velocity replaces the linear velocity in the linear context and the summation replaces the mass in the rotational context and is better known as the moment of inertia. Hence  FORMULA  Since the summations are similar to integrals. In order to derive an integral equation for the moment of inertia Let us divide the body into a number of smaller pieces of equal mass m.The summation now gives the value of I but it still wouldn't be as accurate as the integral hence let us divide the body into a number of infinitely small particles of mass dm.Hence the integral equation for I would be  FORMULA  This integral equation can now be used to derive a linear equation for the moment of inertia of a disc that we are going to work on in this experiment. <picture/>A disc can be considered as a cylinder in 3 dimensions. Hence  FORMULA  If is the density of the of the cylinder and V be the volume of the cylinder then,  FORMULA  Since volume of a cylinder in 2rh, expressing the volume as a function of the radius with a constant height  FORMULA  Substituting this value in the initial integral and solving it  FORMULA  Since the density is the ratio of the mass and volume.  FORMULA  Substituting this in the new integral,  FORMULA  This is the theoretical derivation of the value of the moment of inertia of a disc. Hence  FORMULA  <heading>LOGIC USED TO OBTAIN THE MOMENT OF INERTIA USING EXPERIMENT</heading>Since Torque is the rotational equivalent of Force, it is the product of the angular equivalent of mass I and the equivalent of acceleration α Hence  FORMULA  Substituting linear quantities into the equation  FORMULA  (Eqn 1) From Newton's Law of motion  FORMULA  Since the drum was brought to rest before restarting it, let us take the value of u to be  FORMULA  Hence  FORMULA  Substituting in Eqn 1, the value of F is  FORMULA  If m is the suspended mass, then substituting the value of force,  FORMULA  We have ignored the effects of friction and the tension of the spring in doing this which will result in some considerable experimental error that we would analyse and judge at the end of the experiment. Hence the value of I from this equation is  FORMULA  Hence when we measure the time taken for the different weights to fall and plot a graph of the reciprocal of the square of time against the mass, the slope of the line gives the value of mt 2.Substituting this value in the above equation and the value of the other known factors, the experimental value of the moment of inertia can be obtained. <heading>APPARATUS AND METHODS</heading><heading>APPARATUS</heading>An apparatus consists of a wooden plate with a holder for fixing the disc at one end and a drum with a helical groove on the other end. The drum is has a string tied to it with a lasso on the other end to suspend weights.The apparatus also consisted of a stopwatch used to measure the time taken for the weights to fall to the ground when they were suspended from the drum using the string. <heading>METHOD</heading>A steel disc of radius 7.6 cm and mass 0.696 kg was mounted on the disc holder and screwed in tightly. The string was then wound around the helical groove. A weight was then attached to the lasso at the bottom of the string and dropped down by suspending it gently without applying any downward force manually. Care was also taken to make sure that the drum was at complete rest when the weight was dropped. The time taken for the weight to fall to the ground was measured using a stop watch. The same process was repeated for various weights ranging from 10 grams to 100 grams and making a gradual increase in the weight to finish experimenting the maximum possible range of weights within the given time. The disc was then changed to a smaller one of radius 5.05 cm and mass 0.314 kg and screwed in tightly. The same processes were repeated on this disc and the values were noted. <heading>APPROXIMATIONS AND IGNORED ERRORS</heading>The tension of the cable was considered to be a constant assuming the string to nearly mass less compared to the mass of the discs and the suspended weights. The string was considered to be inextensible and hence the acceleration due to gravity was taken as a constant. Since the time taken for the weight to fall to the ground was measured manually using a stop watch, the reaction time of the person in responding to the start of motion and the drop on the ground is very significant in determining the accuracy of the experiment. The acceleration due to gravity of the weights was further decreased due to effects of friction in the drum. The mass of the weight holder was 0.01 kg which makes a significant change in the accuracy of the results. The apparatus is not designed to maintain constant torque. A system can maintain constant torque only when the radius decreases with increase in force and the radius increases with decrease in the force. In this system the radius of the drum remains constant irrespective of the mass hanged on it and hence the torque of the system keeps changing with the weights. The initial velocity of the weight was considered to be a constant in the derivation of the formula for obtaining the value of I using the experiment but due to Newton's third law the weight kept bouncing up and down even after hitting the ground. Although we did our best to bring the drum to rest before repeating the experiment. But there still remained a small error due to remaining force. Further the position of the hole in the drum that was used to suspend the spring caused the weight to be at rest only when it faced downwards. in other positions it fell to the downward position as all systems tend to equilibrium (Gravitational in this case). <heading>OBSERVATION AND RESULTS</heading>Every individual disc was tested with 5 different weights and the experiment was repeated thrice for every single weight. The graph was then plotted between 1/t2 and mass. Excel was then used to draw the line of best fit and generate a linear equation for the line of best fit in the form of y = mx + c.The value of m represents the slope of the graph which in other words is the value of mt 2.Shown below is the table of readings and corresponding graphs for the two discs used for experimentation. This table represents the readings of the large disc of radius 7.6 cm and mass 0.696 kg. <table/><figure/>This table represents the readings of the small disc of radius 5.05 cm and mass 0.314 kg. <table/><figure/><heading>ANALYSIS OF RESULTS</heading>Thus from the equation of the line of best fit obtained from the graphs above For the large disc, Slope of the line =  FORMULA  For the small disc, Slope of the line =  FORMULA  From the formula derived to obtain the value of I from the experiment in the Theory section of this report,  FORMULA  The values of the other terms were measured g = 9.8 m/s 2 r = 7.6 cm for large and 5.05cm for small s = vertical displacement of weights = 30 cm Hence, The Moment of Inertia I for the large disc (Experimental)= The Moment of Inertia I for the small disc (Experimental) = The theoretical value of the Moment of Inertia of a disc is calculated by the formula  FORMULA  Hence The Moment of Inertia I for the large disc (Theoretical)= 20.1 * 10 -4 The Moment of Inertia I for the small disc (Theoretical) =4.003 * 10 -4 <heading>RECOMMENDATIONS </heading>The disc has to be well lubricated to avoid errors due to friction Choose a fairly inextensible string that doesn't stretch a lot when pulled. The weights holder should be as light as possible but should still be string and durable enough to perform it's functions. An automated sensor that senses the start and fall of the weights will reduce the error caused due to human reaction time. <heading>CONCLUSIONS</heading>This instrument can be much more effective if other existing but inevitable sources of error like friction, tension of string, reaction speed of person measuring the time, etc can be known so that we get a much more accurate value. The values obtained in this method seem to have a high percentage error and are inconsistent. The accuracy also depends a lot on the instrument being used. Various specimens of this same type of instrument can produce results with a strikingly high variation in them. Hence I think the moment of inertia is best measured using theoretical approaches.
