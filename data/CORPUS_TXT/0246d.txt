The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>Based on the acute symptoms  presented with, the differential diagnoses of dizziness and recurrent falls are: Drug side-effects: anti-hypertensive medication can cause a dizziness as a result of postural hypotension whereby the difference between lying and standing systolic blood pressure is >30mmHg. Benign positional vertigo: displacement of the otoconia (otoliths) from the maculae (the receptor for sensing acceleration in the semi-circular canals). Otoconia then settle on the lowest part of the labyrinth. Cardiovascular causes: arrhythmias, transient vertebro-basilar ischaemia, hypotension from bleeding, silent MIs and a low cardiac output. Dehydration: a possibility in 's as he has difficulty swallowing following his previous strokes. Anaemia Elderly patients per se are more prone to falls as they become more unsteady on their feet and their body sway increases due to an impaired compensatory mechanism. Black-outs: can cause falls, which can be preceded by dizziness. There was no evidence or history of blackouts in 's case. On physical examination, it is important to look for a postural drop in blood pressure readings. A full cardiovascular examination should be carried out to determine any arrhythmias such as Atrial Fibrillation for which  is being treated for. Loss of skin turgor and dry mucous membranes will help to determine whether  is dehydrated. <heading>Physical examination and mental state examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading>On general examination  was alert and orientated.

A review of his medication is required, although the change in systolic BP between lying and standing was not significant. Arrhythmias seem an unlikely cause as nothing was noted on examination but an ECG will rule out any cardiac abnormalities. There was nothing else to note of significance on 's physical examination. The most likely diagnoses at this stage are iatrogenic causes, dehydration and benign positional vertigo. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>Physical - Physically,  is at risk of injuring himself following his falls. He has on occasions hit his head as he has fallen and as he continues to fall he will find himself becoming less confident about walking and become less mobile. It is important to minimise his risks of falls to help  retain his independence for as long as possible. Psychological -  remained an upbeat man and wanted to go home. Social -  had social support from his wife and family.  was a mobile man and required some help in light of his visual disability. He was partly independent in his home. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management. Refer to the guidelines to the writing of portfolio cases for the details of the issues to be addressed under each heading.</heading><heading>Investigations </heading><table/><table/><heading>Urine analysis: ++ lymphocytes</heading>'s haemoglobin is low with a normal MCV indicating normochromic normocytic anaemia. Low haemoglobin is another possible cause of his dizziness and treating this deficiency is required. A raised CRP is an indication of infection, which is supported by his urinary symptoms on admission. His raised urea and creatinine is supports the diagnosis of renal failure (acute or acute on chronic). The ultrasound of his abdomen was unremarkable. <heading>Reassurance and Explanation </heading>To appropriately reassure  I would say: "As you know, you have been experiencing dizzy spells and recurrent falls over the last few months and we would like to investigate why this is happening. There are a number of reasons that may explain this and we will investigate them whilst you are in hospital. We would like to carry out some blood tests and an ultrasound of your tummy in order to help us find out what is causing your problems. We would also like to review your medication because it can be common for some drugs to cause dizziness resulting in you falling". To explain the nature of the disease: "Having had your blood tests carried out we have found that you are dehydrated and the iron levels in your blood are quite low, these are the most likely causes of your dizziness and subsequent falls. As a result of your difficulty swallowing it is possible that you have not been getting enough fluids into you and you have become dehydrated. We have also found that you have a urinary tract infection, which we will treat whilst you are in hospital. We are able to treat your dehydration and anaemia whilst you stay as an inpatient". To describe the management plan: "It is important for us to re-hydrate you by giving you fluids through a needle in your hand. We will monitor your blood results to make sure that you are improving. We would also like to get an ultrasound of your kidneys so that we can check that they are functioning well. Because you are still having difficulty swallowing after your strokes we would like to get a swallowing assessment to make sure that you are able to get the right intake of food and drink to try and prevent this from happening again. Once we are happy that your blood tests are back to normal and you are feeling better we will discharge you and ask your GP to monitor your progress". <heading>Prescription/Medical Intervention</heading> was prescribed fluids during his stay in hospital, with regular monitoring of his bloods.  underwent an ultrasound of his kidneys, a chest X-ray and an ECG.  was also catheterised during his stay. Whilst in hospital,  developed a headache which was tender over his temporal region, consequently a temporal artery biopsy was taken; the pathology report described "appearances in keeping with age-related changes".  received a blood transfusion to correct his anaemia. <heading>Observation</heading>Following admission,  was required to stay as an inpatient until his dehydration was resolved and his blood tests had returned to normal. His BP was monitored to check for postural hypotension. 's drugs were reviewed. Longer term observation will involve monitoring 's occurrence of further falls and dizzy spells which will be done by his GP. <heading>Referral and Team Working</heading> will not require further referrals following his discharge. With regards to team working, liaison will be required between his GP and the hospital regarding this current admission and how he was managed. It is important to monitor any further occurrence of falls or dizzy spells and re-admit him if they persist to look for another cause. <heading>Advice and Prevention </heading> should be advised with regards to his fluid intake and diet to try and reduce the chance of him becoming dehydrated again.  should also be advised on how best to try and prevent falls, such as using rails in his home, getting up slowly from a chair or from bed, using sticks to mobilise with and taking his time when he tries to walk. <heading>Outcome A description of the progress of the patient as far as possible. This should include consideration of further issues to be resolved. Where appropriate you should contact by telephone patients who have been discharged home.</heading> had a confirmed diagnosis of acute or chronic renal failure secondary to dehydration and was given fluids whilst in hospital.  remained an inpatient for 1 week. <heading>Evidence based care and issues for research A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s)</heading>Instability, the principal feature of which is falls, is a common feature of elderly people. 20% of 65 to 69 year olds have had a fall in the past 12 months, 40% of people over the age of 80 (1). Falls have important implications both on the personal level and on the level of the cost to the NHS; a large burden of care is placed by people falling and needing inpatient treatment, not to mention the considerable morbidity and mortality suffered by this group. Roughly 50% of falls in the elderly follow a trip or an accident, with a mere 5% caused by dizziness. 5% are accompanied by loss of consciousness, 10% are a result of the legs giving way for no known reason. The remaining 30% are unexplained. (1) The reasons for increasing rates of falls and morbidity associated with falls in the elderly are broadly based on: poorer motor responses, with some abnormal gaits, such as that of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease being more common in the aged poorer protective mechanisms - where the elderly fail to put out their arms to save themselves, leading to reduced upper limb morbidity but increased damage to other structures loss of fitness, as a result of disuse, often as a result of society's expectations Cardiovascular causes of falls include: Postural hypotension: - secondary to intercurrent illness aggravated by chronic venous insufficiency - age associated autonomic neuropathy - drugs (diuretics, nitrates, tricyclic antidepressants, sedatives hypnotics and neuroleptics) Arrhythmias: - Age associated idiopathic fibrosis of conducting tissue may cause sino-atrial exit block, sick sinus syndrome, paroxysmal AF or heart block. <heading>Complications</heading>The primary, obvious complication of a fall is that of injury: <list>laceration, contusion head injury, possibly with subdural haematoma fractured limb, particularly fractured neck of femur fractured rib, which may result in pneumonia</list>The less obvious consequences include: inability to summon help, resulting in: <list>- pressure sores - pneumonia - hypothermia</list>loss of confidence, which may cause increased dependence and morbidity As the population's life expectancy increases, a subsequent increase in the number of falls seen amongst the elderly can be expected. In line with this expected rise in falls, new targets are being set aiming at the prevention of falls. For example, Birmingham North East PCG are running a "Mind Your Step" programme aimed at preventing falls in older people locally (2). This programme of events involves working with social services, the National Osteoporosis Society, leisure services, Age Concern and local community health trusts. The events can be adapted and taken into the community and used in sheltered accommodation and residential homes. The key elements of the project are: exercise - a trained person teaches exercise to older people each week health promotion - a different topic is covered each week and can include input from other health professionals such as pharmacists, podiatrists and physiotherapists getting up off the floor - useful techniques are demonstrated. As the population life expectancy continues to rise, we can expect similar such projects starting up all over the country. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>An important issue raised in this case involve 's residual problems swallowing following his previous strokes, which has in part led to his admission for dehydration. This has highlighted the importance of a swallowing assessment and planning adequate fluid and dietary requirements post-stroke. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading><list>Differential diagnoses for dizziness.
