<abstract><heading>ABSTRACT</heading>The Michelson interferometer was calibrated with a helium-neon laser. Interference fringes were studied with sodium, mercury and white light sources. Coherent laser light was passed through air, CO 2, He, N 2, and Ar gases and the refractive indices were found to be 1.000265, 1.000398, 1.000032, 1.000272, and 1.000259 respectively, which are in agreement with accepted values. The 'frequency gap' between doublet frequencies in sodium lamp light was found to be 5.104x10 11 ±0.059x10 11 Hz compared to an accepted value of 5.154 x10 11 Hz. The coherence length of white light was found to be 3λ which is in conflict with the accepted value of 1.6λ. The coherence length of mercury lamp light was found to be unobtainable with this experimental arrangement. </abstract><heading>1. Introduction</heading>Optical interference is the effect of the superposition of two coherent light waves. This interference can be constructive, when the amplitudes of the waves add in phase, or destructive, when their amplitudes add out of phase. Interferometers allow the intensity (related to the square of the amplitude) of this light to be observed. This allows us to study properties of the light, as well as exploiting this behaviour to study other things. The most famous example is arguably the use of the Michelson interferometer to refute the existence of the ether (the Michelson-Morley experiment). Interferometry can be put to a variety of uses, notably the accurate measurement of small lengths, and small angles. Other uses include inspection of semiconductor wafers, high resolution spectroscopy and measurement of stellar angular diameter, the cosmic microwave background spectrum, vibrations in buildings and geodetic standard baseline measurements. There are two main ways in which interferometers operate: firstly, those based on the lateral division of wave fronts using mirrors or diaphragms; secondly, those based on division of amplitude, which divide the waves by partial reflection, giving rise to two wave fronts with the same wavelength, but having reduced amplitude. The Michelson interferometer is an example of the latter type. In the course of this investigation, the Michelson interferometer was used firstly to determine the frequencies of the sodium doublet, and the coherence lengths of white light and light from a mercury lamp. Secondly, the interferometer was used to determine the refractive indices of various gases, by altering the optical path lengths via changing the gas pressure. <heading>2. Theory</heading><heading>2.1 The Michelson Interferometer</heading>The Michelson interferometer is an instrument used for studying optical interference. The interferometer employs partial reflection, using a beamsplitter to divide a wave into two wave fronts of reduced amplitudes. These two beams are sent in perpendicular directions to be reflected by perpendicular plane mirrors, which then recombine the beams to form interference fringes (see figure 1). <picture/>In addition to this basic arrangement, one of the plane mirrors can be slowly and precisely moved by a micrometer drive. A compensating plate is included to render the optical path lengths equal, since the beam travelling to the moveable mirror has to travel through the body of the beam splitter whereas the other beam is reflected from the surface of the beam splitter before recombination.(see figure 2). <picture/>In the case of this investigation, the mirror-controlling micrometer was attached to a low-geared motor to achieve high-precision motion of the mirror. The slow motion is important because the optical path length only needs to change by the half the light wavelength to move from one interference fringe to the next. Faster movement would result in the series of fringes passing by too rapidly to be accurately detected. In this arrangement, the end of the micrometer was attached to the end of a lever, pivoted to translate the motion of the micrometer into the motion of the mirror. This arrangement meant that the micrometer reading could not be directly interpreted as the amount through which the mirror had moved; as a result, calibration was required. <heading>2.2 Interference fringes</heading>The two beams of a Michelson interferometer interfere constructively when the waves add in phase and destructively when they add out of phase, producing circular interference fringes as a result. When finding the sum of two waves,  FORMULA  (1) it can be shown (see Feynman [3]) that the resultant amplitude is:  FORMULA  (2) When the frequencies, ω, are the same, A denotes the amplitude of the waves,  FORMULA is the phase of the waves, and t is time. This third term is the interference term, and can be positive or negative (meaning constructive or destructive interference respectively), depending on the relative phases of the waves. The interference term is at a maximum when the phase difference is zero: that is, when the waves are in phase. As the movement of the micrometer-controlled mirror increases or decreases the optical path length, L m (see figure 2), the phase difference of the two beams alters, bringing about the interference fringes observed. Between two bright fringes (or two dark fringes), the path difference of the two waves must have changed by λ/2. This corresponds to an actual movement of the moveable mirror of λ/4, since the beam travels to the mirror and back again. <heading>2.3 Beats</heading>The above discussion of interference assumes two waves of the same frequency. For the purposes of this investigation, we require a description of the behaviour of two interfering waves of different frequencies. With two sources at slightly different frequencies but same amplitudes, the result is an oscillation with a slowly pulsating amplitude:  FORMULA  (3) Equation 3 shows that there will be a higher frequency wave, with frequency given by the average of the two component frequencies  FORMULA , which is modulated by a lower frequency wave that has half the frequency of the difference of the two components (see figure 3). <figure/>Actual observation in this investigation resembles figure 4, due to the changing visibility of the interference fringes. Visibility is at a maximum at the zero path difference, and decreases away from this point due lack of coherent in the light over greater distances. Visibility is given by:  FORMULA  (4) <figure/>From the resultant wave beats, one can determine the two slightly different frequencies of the original interfering waves. This can either be done directly or via Fourier transform. A Fourier transform of the wave beats will reveal the component frequencies. <heading>2.4 Coherence</heading>The coherence of the light used in the Michelson interferometer is important. There are two kinds of coherence to consider: temporal and spatial. Temporal coherence is related to the bandwidth of the light, and is an expression of the time over which a light wave resembles a perfect sinusoidal wave. If a wavetrain is assumed to have a Gaussian envelope, then the width of that wavetrain is a measure of temporal coherence, labelled ∆t c. This wavetrain then also has an associated longitudinal spatial coherence length, ∆l c = c∆t c, (c is the speed of light) which is a measure of the spatial extent of the wavetrain. If two points on the wavetrain are more than ∆l c apart, they are completely uncorrelated in phase. It follows that:  FORMULA  (5) Where ∆f is the frequency spread. As long as  FORMULA , then:  FORMULA  (6) Where λav is the average wavelength and fav is the average frequency. In the course of this investigation, light sources of varying coherence were employed: a helium-neon laser having the highest coherence (the longest coherence length) and white light the lowest (with the shortest coherence length). <heading>2. The Doublet Wavelengths of Sodium Lamp Light</heading><heading>2.1 Experimental</heading>Initially, the interferometer was calibrated with the helium-neon laser. The micrometer drive was moved a certain known distance and the number of fringes of the interfered laser light were counted. As the wavelength of the laser is known to be 632.8nm the exact distance the mirror moved can be calculated by dividing the number of fringes by four (two from the light going to the mirror and back, and two from the fringes being λ/2 apart). This calibration gave 162.5 wavelengths in 1.000 mm which means for every 1.000 mm moved according to the micrometer, the mirror actually traversed 0.10283 mm. The fixed mirror was adjusted to the correct alignment to ensure recombination of the split beams. The laser was then replaced with a sodium lamp. Because the sodium lamp is a point source, a lens between the lamp and the beam splitter was necessary to collimate the beam. The micrometer drive was set to zero, so that on running the motor, it would pass through the zero path difference position (for maximum visibility). The drive was set to a slow speed, to capture all the fringes. The detector was set to a suitable gain to cover the whole range of intensities, and the detector position was adjusted to ensure the greatest different between the highest and lowest intensities: again, to maximise visibility. The micrometer was then allowed to move to a reading of 12.280 mm. Labview was used to record the intensity of the resultant fringes via the detector. <heading>2.2 Results</heading><picture/><figure/><heading>2.3 Analysis</heading>Due to the calibration factor the mirror actually moved 1.2628 mm. The intensity graph (figure 6) recorded 8.6 'beats' for this span. Therefore, there are 4.3 beat wavelengths measured, giving the wavelength of a beat to be 0.2937 ±0.0034 mm. The wavelength of the difference of the component wavelengths is twice this, at 0.5873 ±0.0068 mm. This corresponds to a frequency of 5.104 x10 11 ±0.059 x10 11 Hz. The two wavelengths in the sodium lamp light responsible for the beating, are at 589.5923 nm and 588.9953 nm [4]. From equation 3, which is for the amplitude of beats, the intensity can be obtained by squaring. This gives:  FORMULA  (7) Using the corresponding frequencies from the above wavelengths, one can find the difference in frequencies, and subsequently the frequency of the beats, which is 5.154 x 10 11 Hz. <heading>2.4 Discussion</heading>A Fourier transform could have been used to directly extract information about the component frequencies of the sodium light. However the data obtained was not suitable for this means. Instead, by measuring the number of beats in a given length the frequency gap was found. The value for the frequency gap obtained (5.104 x10 11 ±0.059 x10 11 Hz) is consistent with the accepted value of 5.154 x10 11 Hz. <heading>3. The Coherence Lengths of White Light and Mercury Lamp Light</heading><heading>3.1 Experimental</heading>The zero path difference was found by slowly moving the mirror through its range until colourful fringes appeared. In the centre of the fringes was a dark line. Photographs were taken of these fringes. The mirror was moved back until fringes were no longer visible, and then driven through the zero path difference whilst the intensity was being recorded. Care was taken to position the detector in the place which yielded the maximum visibility. Trial experiments with lenses between the source and splitter showed that here, for maximum visibility, it was best to have none at all. <heading>3.2 Results</heading><figure/><picture/><picture/><picture/>At the zero path difference, the fixed mirror was adjusted in a failed attempt to obtain a uniform dark fringe over the entire field of view for mercury light. <heading>3.3 Analysis</heading>The distance over which the white light fringes were visible was not recorded, and so the coherence length of white light could not be found directly from figure 7. However, it can be seen that the fringes disappear after six peaks from the centre and from this we can deduce that the coherence length of white light is 3λ. Hecht [5] gives the coherence length of white light (average wavelength 550 nm) to be  FORMULA . The coherence length of mercury light could not be determined as fringes were visible throughout the whole of the micrometer's range. This implies the coherence length of mercury light is larger than the apparatus can measure. <heading>3.4 Discussion</heading>The central fringe in the white light system is black, although one might expect it to be white, since the two beams should be in phase with each other for any wavelength at this point. In the case of the Michelson interferometer, the first beam undergoes internal reflection in the beamsplitting plate, whilst the second beam undergoes external reflection - with a consequent change of phase. The beams at this (zero path difference) point are therefore not in phase, and destructive interference occurs. As a result, the central interference fringe is black. It was not possible to obtain a black field of view for the mercury light due to the imperfect flatness of the mirrors. It was also impossible to obtain the coherence length of mercury light with this apparatus. This is because the coherence length of mercury lamp light (average wavelength 546.1 nm) is 0.03cm [5]. This is longer than the maximum extent of the mirror movement, which explains why fringes were visible throughout the range. The photodiode will have a sensitivity dependant on the frequency of the incident light. Therefore, it may detect red light more easily than blue light. This has implications for the intensity pattern seen in figure 7. Whilst working under the assumption the intensity shown is for all frequencies equally, it may in fact be showing more of a red bias. In which case the fringes will be more visible to the detector and this could be the reason for finding the coherence length to be nearly twice as large as the accepted value. <heading>4. The Refractive Indices of Air, Argon, Carbon Dioxide, Helium and Nitrogen. </heading><heading>4.1 Theory</heading>If a thickness t of a gas with refractive index n is placed in the path of one of the interferometer beams, the optical path is increased because the light will travel more slowly in the gas. The optical path through the gas segment is now nt, where before it was practically n through the thickness t of air ( FORMULA ). The change in optical path due to the addition of the gas is therefore  FORMULA . This introduces <figure/>extra waves in the path of the beam in question. If ∆m is the number of fringes by which the original fringes are displaced, then:  FORMULA  (8) So by varying n from 1 (in an evacuated tube) to n of the gas in question and knowing how many extra fringes appear then n can be calculated. <heading>4.2 Experimental</heading>An airtight chamber was placed in the path of one of the split laser beams having wavelength 632.8 nm. The chamber was attached to a vacuum pump and evacuated. A rubber bladder filled with the appropriate gas was attached to a tube leading into the chamber. This gas was allowed through the joining tubes and into the chamber before the experiment. The chamber was then re-evacuated. This procedure readied the apparatus for the experiment, ensuring that the bladder, tube and chamber would contain no gas other than that under investigation. A photodiode was set to record the intensity of the recombined laser beam. The vacuum pump was turned off and the bladder valve opened. The gas inside the bladder flowed into the chamber. As a result, the pressure inside the chamber rose from that of a vacuum up to atmospheric pressure. Pressure in the chamber was recorded alongside the intensity. The change in optical thickness due to the presence of the gas caused interference fringes to be shifted and these were recorded by the photodiode as undulations in intensity. When the chamber reached atmospheric pressure the gas bladder was sealed, the vacuum pump turned on and so the chamber re-evacuated. <heading>4.3 Results</heading><list>Air: 42 additional peaks.CO 2: 63 additional peaks.He: 5 additional peaks.N 2: 43 additional peaks.Ar: 41 additional peaks.</list><figure/>Each gas was tested three times and the resulting numbers of peaks were same each time. Temperature and atmospheric pressure remained reasonably constant throughout the experiment. <heading>4.4 Analysis</heading>The wavelength of laser light used was 632.8 nm and the thickness of the chamber was 50.09 mm. <list>Gas n (refractive index)Air 1.000265 ± 41 x10-6CO 2 1.000398 ± 76 x10-6He 1.000032 ± 04 x10-6N 2 1.000272 ± 39 x10-6Ar 1.000259 ± 46 x10-6</list>The actual values given for the refractive index at atmospheric pressure and room temperature are: <list>Air: 1.000292CO 2: 1.000449He: 1.000035N 2: 1.000298zAr: 1.000289</list>Therefore, the experimentally obtained values were in agreement with accepted values. <heading>4.5 Discussion</heading>The gas was supplied into the apparatus out of the rubber bladders. Due to the elasticity of the bladders they could be over-filled and so the gas would be forced out of them by the skin of the bladder trying to contract. This would mean than the pressure of the gas entering the chamber could be higher than anticipated, or at a pressure which varied from experiment to experiment: giving inconsistent results. It would be possible to calibrate the graph, as we know the pressure, and find a function of refractive index against pressure for a certain gas to avoid this problem. The measurements were taken at a different temperature and pressure to the values in the literature, so a small variation will occur therein. Nevertheless, the results obtained show a good match to the accepted values and also indicate the relative densities of the gases at atmospheric pressure. <heading>5. Evaluation</heading>Since the proper functioning of the apparatus relies on the components being precisely aligned, it is sensitive to vibrations, and as such is disturbed by people walking past or coughing in close proximity. Perturbation of the apparatus could result in the light not falling on the detector, and hence a perceived drop in intensity where none existed. Whilst care was taken to maximise the visibility, it cannot be assumed that it was achieved in all cases. The distance of the photodiode from the outside of its housing was unknown, making it difficult to focus the light onto it, so the maximum possible intensity might not fall on the detector. The gain on the photodiode was also adjusted to increase the intensity that was detected. Increasing the gain helped until the photodiode became saturated. It has been assumed throughout that the motion of the mirror was smooth. The motor and band attached to it however did slip occasionally, which would result in a lack of smooth movement of the mirror. As the software recorded intensity against time and not distance travelled by the mirror, it is possible that the fringes would appear stretched as a result. The measured intensity would also be affected by the unavoidable presence of light from sources external to the experiment, even though steps were taken to eliminate these. Ideally there would be no light sources other than those under investigation present. The laser is the ideal for calibration as the long coherence length of laser light means that fringes will be observed throughout the whole length of the mirror's range. This means calibration of the mirrors could be performed without having to find the zero path difference first, as sodium light, say, would only exhibit the fringes around this point. The relatively short arm lengths and distance to the detector are useful for observation of sodium light. Whilst longer arms would have little effect on laser light, the increased distance would mean more sodium light is lost through divergence and absorption as it is a point source. Because less light reaches the detector the visibility is lowered. To determine the coherence length of mercury light, the mirror would have to be able to move over a greater distance than is allowed by this apparatus. Overall the results obtained are sufficient to support the conclusions reached as the experiment is as accurate as feasibly possible.
