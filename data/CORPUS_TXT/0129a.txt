The voyage of Christopher Columbus, in the late fifteenth century, motivated subsequent European explorations of North America, for example John Cabot of England in 1497, and Juan Ponce de Leon of Spain in 1513. Whereas the failure of Cabot's voyage led to an abandonment of exploration until the late sixteenth century, the Spanish continued to explore throughout the era. Spanish expeditions along the North American coast were led by Hernando de Soto between 1539 and 1543, and inland missions under Tristan de Luna between 1559 and 1561, then by Juan Padro between 1566 and 1581. The discovery of the new world 'transformed Spain into a world power, the envy of other European monarchs... inevitably motivated to emulate Spain's success." As a result, both England and Spain founded early coastal settlements in North America in the late sixteenth century and throughout the seventeenth century. Although English and Spanish colonies each had their own distinctive 'colonial identity' and 'would come to perceive themselves as distinct and different peoples', partly as a result of their motherland and characteristics of their settlements, they also exhibited some similarities. <fnote>Alan Taylor, American Colonies.

On the other hand, Bailyn asserts that it is not known how this transition came about in England, however in Spain it was because 'impoverished Andalusian farmworkers and the idle hidalgos and tradesman of the overcrowded cities' favoured overseas migration as somewhat of a escape. On the other hand, many Spaniards were 'forced to leave profitable positions and become soldiers." This is comparable to English convicts who were sent to North America, often as servants. <fnote>Bernard Bailyn, The Peopling of British North America. An Introduction (New York, 1988), p.27 </fnote><fnote>Theodore Corbett, 'Migration to a Spanish Imperial Frontier in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries: St. Augustine', The Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 54, No. 3 (August 1974), p.427 </fnote>The earliest successful Spanish settlement in North America was in Florida's capital, St. Augustine, which was established under Pedro Menendez de Aviles in 1565. Although trading outposts had already been established earlier in the century, for example in Columbia, St. Augustine's was destined to be a military outpost from where the Spanish could defend their trade routes and treasure from privateers sanctioned by the English government (until the 1604 Peace Treaty). The majority of the small Spanish population in Florida were hidalgos, most of whom were single young men engaged in Government service. Thus, there were few families, and those that did exist were often hybrid as a result of intermarriages, with their children being identified as mestizos. English settlements were not so complex as their 'Northern American societies saw less racial mixture." The complex stratification of the Spanish is further enhanced by the variations between Hispanic immigrants in St. Augustine, including divisions between peninsulares of the Iberian Peninsula, and Spanish-American criollo, as focused upon in Corbett's article. Among the peninsulares there were additional differences, much more intricate than those between, for example, the English and the Scottish. As a result, St. Augustine has accurately been illustrated as 'a melting pot of ethnic groups, loosely bound together by... the Spanish Crown." Corbett significantly observes that the source of migration to St. Augustine, during the period of 1671 to 1691, was actually from Spanish Mexico, highlighting internal migration from colonies of New Spain. English settlements also contained people derived from varying ancestries, as a result of internal movements, particularly in the middle colonies of New York and Pennsylvania. <fnote>Anthony McFarlane, The British in the Americas 1480-1815 (New York, 1992), p.182 </fnote><fnote>Corbett, 'Migration to a Spanish Imperial Frontier', p.414-430 </fnote><fnote>Corbett, 'Migration to a Spanish Imperial Frontier', p.414 </fnote>The earliest English colonists 'preferred to search for precious metals, in emulation of the Spanish conquistadores." However, in direct contrast to early Spanish incentives for North American colonies as military bases, the result of the three English missions to Roanoke in the 1580s, despite initially being a military expedition, was the discovery of the value of the land for cultivation. Consequently, the English decided to establish a permanent self-sustaining settlement there and in 1587, under Sir Walter Raleigh, 'the first English families to settle in the Americas' arrived at Roanoke. However, its success was minimal as it had been mysteriously abandoned by the 1590s. This differs significantly with St. Augustine, which, although being burnt down in 1586 and rebuilt, remained a permanent settlement for two hundred years. It is ironic that St. Augustine's was not originally intended as a permanent colony yet persisted as one nonetheless, despite never significantly increasing in terms of population, whereas Roanoke's eventual overall purpose was as a lasting agricultural settlement yet it perished within a few years. <fnote>Richard Middleton, Colonial America. A History, 1607-1760 (Oxford, 1992), p.6 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.124 </fnote>Predominant similarities of both English and American settlements were some of the reasons for the founding of, and migration to them. Trade and profit through the exploitation of the New World were key motivational factors. This was particularly true of the English who wished to break the Spanish monopoly over North America, consequently leading them to a greater share in the American wealth. Thus internal competition and rivalry for prestige and prosperity was stimulated. However, the English were unsuccessful in their formation of the economic settlement of Jamestown, at Virginia's Chesapeake Bay in 1607, as it was built by a malarial swamp that led to the death of the majority of the migrants. The principal reason for the proceeding English settlements in New England were based upon a diverse religious vision of a pure colony, as opposed to financial importance, incited by the Pilgrims in 1620, and followed by the migration of the Puritans the following decade. Unfortunately, 'New England ultimately failed as a "city upon a hill"' although it sustained 'an especially diverse and complex economy', which was ultimately beneficial. <fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.185 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.186 </fnote>McFarlane distinguishes between religion in both Spanish and English settlements. Although it had initially played a similar role in the formation of both sets of settlements, it went on to adopt varying and separate roles in the social element of each. Their religious structures differ considerably in terms of relationship with political and social life. For example, 'English... colonies remained without a formal nobility, even on the small scale that the Spaniards created in their colonial realms." However, New England suffered fewer problems, arguably as a result of their religious attitudes and hence the establishment of a good relationship with the Native Indians. <fnote>McFarlane, The British in the Americas, p.182 </fnote>The pattern of migrants settling in Virginia represented the English population, mostly consisting of 'middling sorts,' similarly to the predominating middle class in Spanish settlements. As in St. Augustine, many early English settlements contained few women or families, which were significant as the stable 'foundation of colonial society'. The structure of New England was, in contrast to both Virginia and St. Augustine, more cohesive as 'family units of the English population were moving essentially intact'. Sometimes even entire communities migrated, cited by Bailyn as being either metropolitan (primarily from London) or provincial, depending on the area of England from whence they came which subsequently determined where they migrated. For example, indentured servitude was a 'major characteristic of the "metropolitan" migration... overwhelmingly dominant in the flows to Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia', the central colonies. <fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.159 </fnote><fnote>Middleton, Colonial America, p.214 </fnote><fnote>Bailyn, The Peopling of British North America, p.14 </fnote><fnote>Bailyn, The Peopling of British North America, p.15 </fnote><fnote>Bernard Bailyn, Voyagers to the West: emigration from Britain to America on the Eve of the Revolution (London, 1987), p.208 </fnote>Maryland, founded by the English in Virginia in 1634, was a relatively successful settlement as they accommodated the Native Indians to a greater extent than the English in the Chesapeake, who had not formed a good relationship with them. However, both England and Spain westernised the Indians, with alcohol, guns and ammunition. Moreover, both were notorious for brutalising and terrorising the Indians. As Taylor surmises, the English promoters of migration depicted the Spanish as 'uniquely brutal colonizers... the Indians of Virginia would welcome the English as their liberators'. However, 'Spanish and English mariners sometimes kidnapped or killed Natives', often the Spanish being increasingly more brutal, reflecting that the English were far from liberating. On the other hand, 'the Cusabo welcomed the English...as a welcome alternative to ineffectual Spanish' signifying an overriding difference in their colonies in that the Indians showed a preference for the English. Such differences are emphasised by Taylor: 'the Spanish were uniquely more cruel and far more brutal and destructive than other Europeans in their treatment of the Indians', representing an ultimate difference between their settlements. Furthermore, with regard to the concept of converting the Indians to Christianity through missionaries, 'the English refusal to convert slaves diverged sharply from the practice of the... Spanish... masters." Their foremost concern was to assimilate them as economic inferiors. Overall, the English and Spanish settlements shared the overwhelming similarity that they both desired to keep the Indians under control and thus 'the first and essential step was to oblige the mobile Indians to settle down in permanent and delimited communities." This had the additional benefit of making a greater expanse of land available for more settlements. <fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.122 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.128 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.232 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.51 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.214 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.197 </fnote>In addition to both settlements' government's attitude towards Indians, they also differed with regard to their own 'planter elite." 'The English monarch exercised little power over his colonists' which explains why they had a share in the power of the colony. On the other hand, Spanish colonies 'permitted neither elected neither assemblies nor individual liberties' and 'unlike... the English... possessed a distinctive set of political aspirations', offering an explanation for their varying governmental structures. <fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.140 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.246 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.140 </fnote><fnote>Canny and Pagden (eds.), Colonial Identity, p.52 </fnote>In the mid-seventeenth century English settlements were developing in the West Indies and became 'crown jewels of the English colonial empire' due to their valuable sugar plantations, particularly in Barbados. The escalating population of the West Indies highlighted their importance as settlements, for example, by 1650 more colonists lived there than the Chesapeake and New England settlements combined, totalling 44,000. The principal migrants were ambitious young men 'heading for the islands to make their fortunes." By the early eighteenth century Jamaica had become 'the wealthiest and most important colony in the English empire." On the other hand, it was not until 1616 that English colonists discovered the wealth that could be wrought from tabacco plantations, long after the Spanish. Despite this, 'plantation settlements in... Virginia, or in parts of Spanish America... had more in common with each other than with the mother country' which is significant as it shows how both sets of settlements grew equally distinct from their homeland. <fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.205 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.206 </fnote><fnote>Bernard Bailyn, Voyagers to the West, p.251 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.220 </fnote><fnote>Canny and Pagden (eds.), Colonial Identity, p7 </fnote>Regarding the significance of the Lesser Antilles of the Caribbean, English and Spanish opinions differed considerably. The English viewed them as important due to their proximity to Spanish ports, whereas the Spanish 'disdained the islands as too small to bother with' as they were trying to colonise Hispaniola, Jamaica, Cuba and Puerto Rico. <fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.206 </fnote>Taylor indicates how England was 'emerging as an important power as Spain grew weaker', represented by the English colony of Carolina which was founded in 1670 defiantly close to Spain's St. Augustine on the border of Florida. However, this had significant repercussions as 'fugitive slaves fled the English colonies to establish themselves in St. Augustine' and the Spanish 'crown favoured encouragement of runaways as part of a policy of hostility to the Carolina settlement." This represents the differences between the settlements and, moreover, the antagonism transpiring between them. <fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.224 </fnote><fnote>Corbett, 'Migration to a Spanish Imperial Frontier', p.429 </fnote><fnote>Corbett, 'Migration to a Spanish Imperial Frontier', p.429 </fnote>There is a remarkable distinction between migration to English and Spanish settlements as highlighted by Bailyn: <quote>By 1700 the overall population of Britons or their descendants in the Western Hemisphere was approximately 250,000, which is double the number of peninsular Spaniards... known to be in Spanish America. </quote><fnote>Bernard Bailyn, Voyagers to the West, pp.24-5 </fnote>This is contested by Taylor who claims that, in the sixteenth century alone, there were 250,000 Spanish migrants in North America. However, it can still be inferred from Bailyn that there was a greater percentage of English migrants than Spanish, represented by the population of England's thirteen colonies being 700,000 by 1760. This difference in population is supported by the fact that the population of Spanish Florida was a mere three thousand, half that of English Georgia's population, and compared to New England homogenous population of 500,000 in 1760. <fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.61 </fnote><fnote>Bernard Bailyn, Voyagers to the West, p.25 </fnote>Since the populations of English settlements were demographically self-sustaining and thus growing continuously, increasingly more than the Spanish, their societies emerged within a more stratified and viable social and economic framework, which encouraged permanency. Alongside differences between European colonies, within each of their settlements 'communities differed... the distinctions among them, more than their similarities, shaped the ways in which new arrivals were absorbed into the society." As a result of their large and diverse population, English settlements were consistently more dynamic than the Spanish and, moreover, further developed as highlighted by their colonial expansion inland. At first, the English settlements were 'clustered on a coastal strip', for example, 'Nova Scotia and the Floridas... were coastal frontiers." These were initially English and Spanish settlements but by the mid-seventeenth century both were in English hands and were distinguishable from other regions because these settlements were convenient for Atlantic trade. Eventually, the 'English secured a lucrative, dynamic, and expansive base on the North American continent', partly due to the beneficial position of their settlements. On the other hand, in Spanish New Mexico imports were only allowed through Vera Cruz, which resulted in economic stagnation. <fnote>Bailyn, The Peopling of British North America, p.53 </fnote><fnote>McFarlane, The British in the Americas, p.154 </fnote><fnote>Bernard Bailyn, Voyagers to the West, p.358 </fnote><fnote>Taylor, American Colonies, p.61 </fnote>In conclusion, the early English and Spanish settlements in North America shared both similarities and differences in terms of their trade, demographical structures, religious beliefs, their nature towards Native Indians and their geographical location. Although some of these similarities and differences were implicit, many were explicit, as seen specifically with regard to their purpose and religion.
