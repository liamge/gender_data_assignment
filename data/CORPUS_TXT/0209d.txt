The HFE, established following extensive deliberation under the Warnock Report, regulates areas of reproductive medicine. The creation of new, external reproductive techniques that utilised genetics and once inseparable human constituents as reproductive components, created "a new generation of acute and subtle dilemmas". Reproductive medicine; empowering often private, commercial entities, questioned the power, responsibility and motivation of scientists and medical practitioners; probing the limits of accountability "between science, the state, 'society' and capitalism". It raised "unparalleled questions for law": its role, the protected interests, or indeed whether market-based solutions may be more appropriate than regulation. Fifteen years later, medicine has developed "exponentially"; yet regulation remains largely unchanged. I shall examine, in light of the Hashmi and Whitaker decisions, and the broader context, whether there is a need for review. <fnote>Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Warnock Report, conducted under Mary Warnock in 1984 </fnote><fnote>Professor John Harris, sourced from ROGER BROWNSWORD, REGULATING HUMAN GENETICS: NEW DILEMMAS FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 14 - 39 © Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote><fnote>SAMANTHA HALLIDAY AND DEBORAH LYNN STEINBERG, THE REGULATED GENE: NEW LEGAL DILEMMAS, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 2 - 13 © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved. </fnote><fnote>SAMANTHA HALLIDAY AND DEBORAH LYNN STEINBERG, THE REGULATED GENE: NEW LEGAL DILEMMAS, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 2 - 13 © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved. </fnote><fnote>Robert G.

Law should provide "legitimacy", promoting "acceptable boundaries" for developments. However, this legitimacy can "often owe more to Realpolitik", than that crafted through moral reasoning, debate and consensus; particularly when this 'legislative legitimacy' varies between legal jurisdictions. Legal regulation questions the very fabric of morality. Since this is a diverse rather than homogenous entity, consensus on a moral, let alone legal level is improbable. Law must either convey an ideological, predictable and determinate approach or react with "pragmatism", on an ad hoc basis to new issues. These considerations affect law's response to the two fundamental, "competing (and often conflicting) interests": research and its potential benefits, versus morality and safety; what Brownsword names the "regulatory tilt".  <fnote>ROGER BROWNSWORD, REGULATING HUMAN GENETICS: NEW DILEMMAS FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 14 - 39 © Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote><fnote>ROGER BROWNSWORD, REGULATING HUMAN GENETICS: NEW DILEMMAS FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 14 - 39 © Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote><fnote>ROGER BROWNSWORD, REGULATING HUMAN GENETICS: NEW DILEMMAS FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 14 - 39 © Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote><fnote>Deech, sourced from SAMANTHA HALLIDAY AND DEBORAH LYNN STEINBERG, THE REGULATED GENE: NEW LEGAL DILEMMAS, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 2 - 13 © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved. </fnote><fnote>Deech, sourced from SAMANTHA HALLIDAY AND DEBORAH LYNN STEINBERG, THE REGULATED GENE: NEW LEGAL DILEMMAS, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 2 - 13 © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved. </fnote><fnote>(Emphasis original) SAMANTHA HALLIDAY AND DEBORAH LYNN STEINBERG, THE REGULATED GENE: NEW LEGAL DILEMMAS, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 2 - 13 © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved. </fnote><fnote>Idea from SAMANTHA HALLIDAY AND DEBORAH LYNN STEINBERG, THE REGULATED GENE: NEW LEGAL DILEMMAS, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 2 - 13 © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved. </fnote><fnote>Margaret Brazier, Regulating the Reproduction business, Medical Law Review, 7, Summer 1999, pp. 166-193 © Oxford University Press </fnote><fnote>SAMANTHA HALLIDAY AND DEBORAH LYNN STEINBERG, THE REGULATED GENE: NEW LEGAL DILEMMAS, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 2 - 13 © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved. </fnote><fnote>ROGER BROWNSWORD, REGULATING HUMAN GENETICS: NEW DILEMMAS FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 14 - 39 © Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote>Warnock recommended an independent and "comprehensive scheme of regulation" was required for specific reproductive technologies; including an advisory/licensing agency to ensure: quality, protection, and safety. The HFE limits reproductive technologies and research involving embryos, placing them in "strictly defined ethical and legal backgrounds". It prohibits the creation of embryos outside the body and storage of gametes without a licence; whilst S3 restricts licence-holder's use of embryos. It bestows significant powers to a regulatory authority, the HFEA, which supervises the licensing process. Licenses permit clinics to provide subscribed treatment services (e.g. IVF), or to store or research on embryos/gametes. Under Schedule Two S3(1), the HFEA can grant licences only where "research is necessary or desirable", which: advances infertility treatment, "knowledge about the causes of congenital disease" or "miscarriages"; develops "more effective...contraception", or "methods for detecting...gene/chromosome abnormalities".  <fnote>Warnock Report, sourced from Margaret Brazier, Regulating the Reproduction business, Medical Law Review, 7, Summer 1999, pp. 166-193 © Oxford University Press </fnote><fnote>Aurora Plomer, Beyond the HFEA 1990 - The Regulation of Stem cell Research in the UK, Medical Law Review, 10 Summer 2002, pp132-164, © Oxford University Press </fnote><fnote>Section 3, Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority </fnote><fnote>Aurora Plomer, Beyond the HFEA 1990 - The Regulation of Stem cell Research in the UK, Medical Law Review, 10 Summer 2002, pp132-164, © Oxford University Press </fnote><fnote>Schedule 2 S3 (1) HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Schedule 2 S3 (1) HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Schedule 2 S3 (1) HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Schedule 2 S3 (1) HFE Act 1990 </fnote>Legal intervention from a fixed perspective "distorts" sciences' "essentially fluid, dynamic nature;" constructing "hard law" that as science develops, leaves regulatory provisions behind. Regulation therefore needs to "incorporate a degree of flexibility or open-endedness", to maintain "regulatory connection" between science and law, even though this can "militate against predictability and consistency". By establishing an autonomous authority with significant, devolved power that is "built on [a] consensus" between medical regulators, clinics and scientists; the UK's scheme combines elements of these theories. Whilst the HFE provides a fixed position, perhaps reflecting some core, minimum ethical standards rather than adopting an ideological perspective; the HFEA is more adaptive; and combined with the courts is prepared to purposively interpret provisions, asserting to provide a "high degree of public accountability in the development and delivery of new treatments and research". The government claim to have created a "robust and proportionate regulatory framework [that]...anticipates and continues to address public concerns". It is this notion I seek to challenge. No single regulatory framework for genetics exists, whilst the HFE has no "single, coherent philosophical underpin". Consequently, as technology has developed beyond expectation, law has become reactive and fraught with "contradiction".  <fnote>Lee and Morgan, sourced from SAMANTHA HALLIDAY AND DEBORAH LYNN STEINBERG, THE REGULATED GENE: NEW LEGAL DILEMMAS, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 2 - 13 © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved. </fnote><fnote>Lee and Morgan, sourced from SAMANTHA HALLIDAY AND DEBORAH LYNN STEINBERG, THE REGULATED GENE: NEW LEGAL DILEMMAS, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 2 - 13 © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved. </fnote><fnote>ROGER BROWNSWORD, REGULATING HUMAN GENETICS: NEW DILEMMAS FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 14 - 39 © Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote><fnote>ROGER BROWNSWORD, REGULATING HUMAN GENETICS: NEW DILEMMAS FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 14 - 39 © Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote><fnote>ROGER BROWNSWORD, REGULATING HUMAN GENETICS: NEW DILEMMAS FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 14 - 39 © Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote><fnote>SAMANTHA HALLIDAY AND DEBORAH LYNN STEINBERG, THE REGULATED GENE: NEW LEGAL DILEMMAS, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 2 - 13 © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved. </fnote><fnote>Robert G.

CNR was not envisaged under the HFE, which expressly prohibited 'cell substitution' cloning. However, HGAC and HFEA believed that as CNR involved the creation of embryos outside the body, it fell "within the HFE", and therefore the HFEA's jurisdiction. This imprecise, "purposive" interpretation implied that eggs were included within the definition of embryos; giving effect to Parliament's intention to prohibit cloning. Realistically, CNR was not "specifically" excluded by S3(3)(d): it did not involve fertilisation (replacement rather than fusion). The HFE defines embryos as where "fertilisation is complete", which "includes eggs in the process of fertilisation". However, as Wilmut asserts, CNR oocytes would never be fertilised "because the nucleus is transferred into it". It was questionable whether CNR was at all regulated. The Donaldson Report however endorsed the HFEA's position, "understating" the difficulty in asserting precise regulatory parameters. CNR was not prohibited, but licensable; a convenient proposition which the government accepted: the HFE was inadequate to regulate a perilous technique; but the HFEA could side-step the issue by refusing CNR licences. It is this sense of 'make do and mend' that characterises recent regulatory development. Fortunately, the HRC was later enacted (prohibiting CNR) following a ruling that CNR was unregulated. It serves as a presiding example of law introducing "control mechanisms only after scientific excess"; its unhurried reaction and attempts to use existing structures to remedy issues deserving of more significant response. <fnote>Cell Nuclear Replacement </fnote><fnote>Cloning is expressly prohibited under S3 (3) (d) HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Human Genetics Advisory Commission </fnote><fnote>Aurora Plomer, Beyond the HFEA 1990 - The Regulation of Stem cell Research in the UK, Medical Law Review, 10 Summer 2002, pp132-164, © Oxford University Press </fnote><fnote>ROGER BROWNSWORD, REGULATING HUMAN GENETICS: NEW DILEMMAS FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 14 - 39 © Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote><fnote>ROGER BROWNSWORD, REGULATING HUMAN GENETICS: NEW DILEMMAS FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 14 - 39 © Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote><fnote>Cloning is expressly prohibited under S3 (3) (d) HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>S1 HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>S1 HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Wilmut, sourced from Aurora Plomer, Beyond the HFEA 1990 - The Regulation of Stem cell Research in the UK, Medical Law Review, 10 Summer 2002, pp132-164, © Oxford University Press </fnote><fnote>Donaldson Report, 2001 </fnote><fnote>Aurora Plomer, Beyond the HFEA 1990 - The Regulation of Stem cell Research in the UK, Medical Law Review, 10 Summer 2002, pp132-164, © Oxford University Press </fnote><fnote>Human Reproductive Cloning Act, 2001 </fnote><fnote>As per Crane J; R (on the application of Quintavalle) v Secretary of State for Health (2001) 4 All E.R. 1013 </fnote><fnote>SAMANTHA HALLIDAY AND DEBORAH LYNN STEINBERG, THE REGULATED GENE: NEW LEGAL DILEMMAS, Medical Law Review, 12, Spring, pp. 2 - 13 © Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote>The forced interpretation used in Hashmi illustrated the HFE's "outdated" and compromised status. The Hashmis wished to select embryos to produce a child bearing suitable tissue to cure their son who suffered with BT. PGD, a process which detects genetic anomalies to ensure only healthy embryos are selected for reproduction, had been commonly permitted by the HFEA. The Hashmis wanted to extend this process to include HLA tissue-typing to select a suitable tissue match. The HFEA permitted this, stating that where "PGD is already undertaken...the use of tissue typing to save the life of a sibling can be justified", albeit in "rare circumstances and under strict controls". CORE requested a JR, arguing the HFEA "had gone beyond the HFE;" permitting a practice that was not "designed to help women carry children," which subsequently could not be licensed. <fnote>R ex parte Quintavelle v HFEA </fnote><fnote>Beverley Mulvenna, Pre-Implantation genetic diagnosis, Tissues typing and beyond: the legal implications of the Hashmi case, Medical Law International 2004, Vol. 6, pp.163-182, AB Academic Publishers, </fnote><fnote>Beta Thassaemia </fnote><fnote>Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis </fnote><fnote>Human Leukocyte Antigen Tissue Typing </fnote><fnote>HFEA Statement: </fnote><fnote>HFEA Statement: </fnote><fnote>Acronym: Comment On Reproductive Ethics </fnote><fnote>Judicial Review </fnote><fnote>CORE, sourced from R ex parte Quintavelle v HFEA </fnote><fnote>CORE, sourced from R ex parte Quintavelle v HFEA </fnote>However, Kay's initial High Court judgement highlighted an unexpected "flaw in the act's drafting": PGD was not, prima facie, a licensable "treatment service". Yet in common with practice, PGD had been permitted, illustrating the potentially limiting effect of legislation clearly in need of revision. In an attempt to justify/secure PGD, the court considered whether under the "restrictive" definition of "treatment services" ("assisting women to carry children"), PGD assisted women to carry children. Kay asserted that under Schedule-Two embryos must be "suitable for being placed within a woman;" and as PGD guarantees suitability, it was permissible. However, the Court of Appeal's judgement overcame these difficulties by using "an approach to statutory interpretation that was not just purposive but creative". Following Pepper v Hart, legislation which is "ambiguous or obscure or [where] the literal meaning...leads to absurdity", may be interpreted in context with Parliamentary intention. Consequently, the court used a resourceful, 'back door entrance' to secure PGD's use; arguing it was envisaged under the HFE as it had been "universally assumed that it was licensable"; therefore, a contrary literal interpretation would lead to "absurdity". PGD is a necessary procedure in reproductive medicine to prevent genetic defects. Clearly considerable uncertainty exists whether it is licensable; an extremely undesirable position. <fnote>Kay LJ </fnote><fnote>Beverley Mulvenna, Pre-Implantation genetic diagnosis, Tissues typing and beyond: the legal implications of the Hashmi case, Medical Law International 2004, Vol. 6, pp.163-182, AB Academic Publishers, </fnote><fnote>Treatment service under S11(1) </fnote><fnote>Beverley Mulvenna, Pre-Implantation genetic diagnosis, Tissues typing and beyond: the legal implications of the Hashmi case, Medical Law International 2004, Vol. 6, pp.163-182, AB Academic Publishers, </fnote><fnote>Under S HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>S2(1) HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Schedule Two, HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Schedule 2, HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Beverley Mulvenna, Pre-Implantation genetic diagnosis, Tissues typing and beyond: the legal implications of the Hashmi case, Medical Law International 2004, Vol. 6, pp.163-182, AB Academic Publishers, </fnote><fnote>Pepper v Hart (1993) 1 All ER42 CA </fnote><fnote>Pepper v Hart (1993) 1 All ER42 CA </fnote><fnote>Court of Appeal </fnote><fnote>Beverley Mulvenna, Pre-Implantation genetic diagnosis, Tissues typing and beyond: the legal implications of the Hashmi case, Medical Law International 2004, Vol. 6, pp.163-182, AB Academic Publishers, </fnote><fnote>Beverley Mulvenna, Pre-Implantation genetic diagnosis, Tissues typing and beyond: the legal implications of the Hashmi case, Medical Law International 2004, Vol. 6, pp.163-182, AB Academic Publishers, </fnote>The Court of Appeal's responses to the HFEA's arguments for HLA were "less than satisfactory". The HFEA firstly contested that HLA did not require a licence as it used cells from embryos, rather than embryos. In agreement, Schiemann inferred that HLA and PGD were similar; subsequently neither fell within the "prohibited area" of illegal practices. This "misses the point": just because testing for genetic abnormalities was not considered to be objectionable "fails to justify tissue typing," as HLA does not identify genetic defects. Fortunately, Mance rejected the HFEA's argument as licences cannot be granted where one of the two purposes (HLA/PGD) fall outside the act. Otherwise, where PGD had been permitted to prevent genetic anomalies, clinics would be able to screen cells for other characteristics, "including sex", enabling those parents access to "a range of tests that were forbidden to others";  an undesirable outcome. <fnote>Beverley Mulvenna, Pre-Implantation genetic diagnosis, Tissues typing and beyond: the legal implications of the Hashmi case, Medical Law International 2004, Vol. 6, pp.163-182, AB Academic Publishers, </fnote><fnote>Schiemann LJ </fnote><fnote>Schiemann LJ, R ex parte Quintavelle v HFEA </fnote><fnote>Beverley Mulvenna, Pre-Implantation genetic diagnosis, Tissues typing and beyond: the legal implications of the Hashmi case, Medical Law International 2004, Vol. 6, pp.163-182, AB Academic Publishers, </fnote><fnote>Beverley Mulvenna, Pre-Implantation genetic diagnosis, Tissues typing and beyond: the legal implications of the Hashmi case, Medical Law International 2004, Vol. 6, pp.163-182, AB Academic Publishers, </fnote><fnote>Mance LJ </fnote><fnote>Sally Sheldon and Stephen Wilkinson, Hashmi and Whitaker, an unjustifiable and misguided distinction?

CORE challenged this, stating treatments should only available if necessary to "assist women [to] carry children"; a literal interpretation of the HFE. The court adopted the HFEA's "purposive" approach. Lord Phillips suggested Schedule Two permitted research which develops "methods for detecting...gene or chromosome abnormalities," therefore allowing PGD as it may assist women by preventing defects. Subsequently, Phillips claims the only difference between PGD and HLA was "the desired characteristics" that were selected (healthy vs. tissue match), and that HLA "would assist some women who would otherwise refrain from conception"; declaring the difference "cannot be important". Realistically, he "stretched the statutory provisions beyond...[what]...could be reasonably justified", presenting an oversimplified analysis that should not, and "could not apply to tissue typing"'. From this tiny, yet gauche distinction he makes an exceptionally important moral statement, taking reproductive law into un-chartered territory; "a dangerous first step towards allowing...parents to choose characteristics of [their] baby, such as eye colour and sex".  <fnote>CORE on the HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Court of Appeal </fnote><fnote>Sally Sheldon and Stephen Wilkinson, Hashmi and Whitaker, an unjustifiable and misguided distinction?

Medical Law Review, 12, Summer 2004, pp.137-163, Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote>Mance's justification of HLA was inventive: RCN v DHSS permits courts to hold a new scenario under legislative power should it fall within the "same genus of facts as intended by Parliament". By inferring that S13(5) (considers potential child's welfare before IVF treatment commences) could include benefits created by the prospective child saving another; and that treatment services must "have regard to prospective parents and society's concern for others"; he justified placing HLA within the same genus. This was "plucked out of thin air", a meaningless generality with little value, that focuses not on the child's benefit; but societal gain. This use of S13(5) is inconsistent with Parliamentary intention: it is normally used to deny treatment to inappropriate candidates. Furthermore, as the HFEA did not regard PGD/HLA to be similar; the judgement "disregard[s] the fundamentally different purpose" of each test; advancing unjustifiable generalisations that destroy the precision and integrity of the regulatory regime. The genus argument, whilst supported with evidence (Hansard, Ministerial Advice), promotes a vague and speculative stance that moves beyond the normal parameters of judicial creativity; and is at risk of becoming a warrant for judges to promote their own moral standpoints. It is a licence to extend law on an ad hoc, and 'as needed' basis that may lead to a slippery slope; particularly as it has been undemocratically developed by those with little expertise, who clearly have very different ideas on why or how HLA should be justified, and even if it is possible under existing regulation. <fnote>Royal college of Nursing v Department of health and social security </fnote><fnote>Mance LJ, R ex parte Quintavelle v HFEA </fnote><fnote>S13(5) HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Mance LJ, R ex parte Quintavelle v HFEA </fnote><fnote>Beverley Mulvenna, Pre-Implantation genetic diagnosis, Tissues typing and beyond: the legal implications of the Hashmi case, Medical Law International 2004, Vol. 6, pp.163-182, AB Academic Publishers, </fnote><fnote>S13(5) HFE Act 1990 </fnote><fnote>Idea from Sally Sheldon and Stephen Wilkinson, Hashmi and Whitaker, an unjustifiable and misguided distinction? Medical Law Review, 12, Summer 2004, pp.137-163, Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote>The consequences of Hashmi should not be underestimated. Effectively, where PGD is used, the HFEA can authorise the "selection of embryos for blue eyes, blonde hair or desired sex, without reference to Parliament". Could this really have been Parliament's intention: to delegate this form of ethical responsibility to an unelected regulator? Brownsword suggests that when Phillips justifies HLA and PGD as methods to ensure embryos are "suitable for the purpose of being placed within [women]" (free from "defect[s]"), suitability becomes "equated with fitness for such purposes as the (consumer) parents may specify". It is a dangerous and undemocratic advancement, illustrating the law's inability to evolve to new situations, and an unjustifiable extension of an "outdated" statute through "constitutionally undesirable means". The court struggle to justify their proposition, advancing feeble explanations that are "at odds with the...statutory construction". It illustrates "once again, the need for urgent review", to maintain regulatory connection and ensure issues are "debated and legislated in the correct forum"; rather than placing the emphasis on the HFEA and courts to develop law. Hashmi leaves this and future issues with the HFEA for "case-by-case decision[s]", prolonging uncertainty and rendering it "unaccountable". It empowers the HFEA to licence HLA with "discretion"; implying Parliament delegated authority to "decide what is legally and morally permissible;" allowing contentious ethical decisions to be decided by a statutory regulator without opportunity for debate; a situation which "raises serious questions...[of]...legitimacy". It is a very unusual scenario that demands review, particularly because of the HFEA's close affiliation with industry and science. It is at risk from "undue influence," particularly when the HFEA operations are funded through licensing, necessitating 'productive' commercial relationships. In chorus, the STC's recent report suggests the HFEA must be reformed or "abolished", a position welcomed by the BSC. "Empowering competing professionals to be part of a licensing process was not particularly sound".  <fnote>Confirmed by the HFEA when asked by Law Lords during the Hearing into Fertility Regulation, Tuesday, 8th March.

In Whitaker, parents wished to use HLA to provide tissue for a child suffering with DBA. However, as DBA was "sporadic" rather than hereditary, PGD was denied under Hashmi as the risk to their embryos was no greater than natural conception. The HFEA distinguished Whitaker because: it was wrong to create a child for a particular purpose/procedure; whilst PGD may create unknown health risks. Realistically, only the latter argument distinguishes Whittaker from Hashmi: if the potentially dangerous PGD procedure is used to prevent a child from being born with a serious illness, the "benefits outweigh the risks", therefore you might as well conduct HLA. Yet when PGD is applied purely to use HLA, there is no initial risk; therefore the child may be subjected to "something harmful". Yet, an equally valid argument exists in support of HLA: surely the benefit for the Whitaker's potential child is "existing rather than not existing"?  <fnote>Diamond Blackfan Anaemia </fnote><fnote>Beverley Mulvenna, Pre-Implantation genetic diagnosis, Tissues typing and beyond: the legal implications of the Hashmi case, Medical Law International 2004, Vol. 6, pp.163-182, AB Academic Publishers, </fnote><fnote>Sally Sheldon and Stephen Wilkinson, Hashmi and Whitaker, an unjustifiable and misguided distinction?

Medical Law Review, 12, Summer 2004, pp.137-163, Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote>Whilst Hashmi was principally correct; I suggest it is morally indistinguishable from Whitaker. Kantian theory suggests we should never treat people as 'means,' but surely this only applies if we treat people "solely or merely as means". It is acceptable to create a child as a playmate, to "mend a broken marriage", or to "buy, buy, buy": most conceptions are for selfish reasons rather than to extend humanity. There are worse reasons to create a child than to save another. Whilst positively selecting characteristics is a dangerous and now real first step towards 'designer babies,' there is no reason why selection cannot occur in some instances and not others: "fundamental moral difference [exists] between designer and saviour babies". Hashmi assumes that 'saviour babies' are morally acceptable only in specific scenarios, denying opportunity for real, democratic debate; and in paying 'lip-service' to restraint and caution, draws perhaps an "unjustifiable and misguided distinction" that is "legally untenable."  <fnote>Sally Sheldon and Stephen Wilkinson, Hashmi and Whitaker, an unjustifiable and misguided distinction?

Medical Law Review, 12, Summer 2004, pp.137-163, Oxford University Press 2004 </fnote>A comprehensive review of the parameters, and how we regulate fertility is required; a review that must remain ongoing. Law focuses too keenly on protecting controversial, 'head-line' treatments; we must redress the balance, and focus as Warnock suggested on quality, protection, and safety. It is "illogical" to "single out just one kind of reproductive medicine...for such...elaborate regulation". There is "no control over the...bulk of...reproductive practice". GIFT is more likely to result in "multiple pregnancy", standards of tubal surgery are "much more variable", whilst Hyper-stimulation is "certainly the most dangerous reproductive technique"; yet all are unregulated. "IVF is no more dangerous than other techniques", yet because it is morally controversial we loose sight of what must be our principle aim: safety. Regulating such a large area of reproductive medicine would be "very expensive"; whilst it is clear the HFEA "has been chronically short of money". This is the reality of medical regulation: it must be situated in context with policy, economics and resource availability. This is not a problem that will vaporise. As medicine develops new challenges confront us. Society is also changing; and in the advent of Human Rights and liberalisation, we must face new issues, e.g. assisted homosexual conceptions. The HFE does not focus enough on "improving clinical standards". We are a developed country: no shortage of resources should prevent proper regulation of all reproductive medicine; existing and future. Fertility is a global industry regulated in different ways and degrees. The Whitaker's and eight other couples, who were all denied treatment, received HLA in other jurisdictions. We must further our co-operation, and produce an extended legal regime that is reviewed regularly; a product of proper democratic debate that operates comfortably within safe and respected boundaries. Existing regulation, limited to specific applications and supplemented "on an ad hoc basis" "cannot...adapt to evolving science". It is "technology-led", rather than teleological, "reflecting what scientists regard as respectable". When, "commercial fortunes ride [on] matters of life and death", is this acceptable? <fnote>Robert G.
