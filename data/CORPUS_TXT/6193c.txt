The objective of this experiment is to determine the reducing sugar content of Jam. Jam contains both reducing sugars (invert sugar) and non- reducing sugar (sucrose). <heading>Method</heading>A metal dish containing sand and glass were first weighed. A minced beef sample were added and re-weighed accurately. The sand and meat were mixed and kept (with the lid off) in oven at 150 C for 30 minutes. It was allowed to cool and re-weighed. The dried minced sample were transferred into an extraction thimble and place it in the Soxhlet extractor. A dry 250ml extraction flask was weighed and a few anti-bumping granules were added. The flask was connected and the extractor with petroleum ether (b.p 40 -60ºC ) until the solvent siphons over into the flask. Sufficient solvent were added to half fill the extraction flask. The heater was turned and were set , so that the solvent boils gently under reflux (2-3 drops per second). It was kept for 1.5 hrs for extraction, due to time limitations of the practical, but the proper procedures is to extract for 4 hours. <heading>Results</heading><heading>Soxhlet extraction</heading><heading>Calculations</heading><table/>According to the data obtained the net weight of the fat at the first run is equal to 0,792 g. The weight of our meat sample equals to 3,0532 g. By dividing the net weight of fat by the weight of our meat sample we can calculate the percent of the fat in our sample. As a result, the percent content of the fat in our sample is equal to  FORMULA  When we did the similar calculations for the second run, we conclude that the percent content is equal to 25,3 %. <heading>Discussions</heading>Sinar et al (1976) have suggested limits for fat and moisture content of minced beef. These authors advanced an opinion that the fat content of minced beef should not exceed 25%. Minced meat is defined in "The Mince and Minced Meat Preparations(Hygiene) Regulations 1995 (which implements Council Directive 94/65/EC) as being "meat which has been minced into fragments or passed through a spiral screw mincer and includes such meat to which not more than 1 per cent salt has been added". These Regulations set compositional requirements for total fat content of pre-packed minced meat of different species sold using specific designations (see Table A). They only apply to products that use the exact wording of the Regulations. The Regulations do not apply to minced meat sold loose in butchers' shops. There are no statutory limits for the fat content of mince sold as "lean" or "extra/super lean". <table/><heading>Fat by acidic extraction</heading>3g of meat were accurately weighed and transferred to a quick fit conical flask of 100ml. 20ml of water were added. 6 drops of ammonia solution were added in the fume cupboard and a few boiling chips were added. The mixture was boiled gently until the meat dispersed. 20ml of hydrochloric acid were added and it was heated and boiled for 3 minutes and kept for cooling. After that 20ml of ethanol were added and mixed well. The liquid was transferred into a separating funnel. The funnel was stoppered and shaken well for 15 seconds. 25ml of petroleum ether were added and shaken again for 30 seconds. The organic (upper) and aqueous (lower) were separated. The lower layer (aqueous) were ran off and the upper (organic) layer collected in a conical flask. The aqueous layer were transferred back into the separating funnel and re-extracted with 15ml of petroleum ether. Again the (aqueous) into a conical flask. The two organic extracts were combined in the separating funnel and washed with 10 ml of water. The water layer ran off and the organic layer was washed with 25ml of salt solution. The lower (aqueous) layer ran off. The organic solution were transferred into a conical flask ad it was shaken with 5g of anhydrous sodium sulphate to dry it. The organic extract was filtered through a fluted filter paper into a weighed round-bottomed flask. The solvent was evaporated by using a distillation unit with "tap-off" and finally the residual solvent was evaporated by using a rotary evaporator until it reached constant weight. The flask was weighed and the percentage of the fat was calculated. <table/>From the results we see that the net weight of fat in our meat sample is 0,668 g. We have already mentioned that the sample we weighted is 3,006 g. As a result, we can conclude that in 100 g of the sample the content of fat is 22 g. So the fat content in our sample is 22 %. <heading>Determination of fat content of milk (Gerber method)</heading>10 ml of sulfuric acid were put into a milk butyrometer and 10.94 ml of milk were added and also 1ml of isoamyl alcohol. The butyrometer was stoppered by using the keys. It was placed in the protected stand and inverted. The butyrometer was centrifuged in a Gerber centrifuge at speed 8( 1000rpm) for 5 minutes. After that the butyrometer was placed in a water bath at 65˚C for 5 minutes. The percentage of fat was directly read off from the scale. <heading>Whole - fat milk</heading><table/><heading>Semi-skimmed milk</heading><table/>We did not do any calculations since it the result was straightforward and clear perc by reading the percentage from the scale. <heading>Discussions </heading>Readings to an accuracy of 0.05percent are usually adequate for routine purposes. As it is difficult to separate the small fat globules in homgenised (eg.sterilised ) milk, it is advisable to re-centrifuge after warming in the 65˚C bath until it reaches a maximum.
