<abstract><heading>Abstract</heading>The present study sought to evaluate some methods of analyses of fruit and vegetables, as well as determining the ripeness of green and yellow bananas, the tomato content of Heinz' ketchup and the peanut content of Snickers and Galaxy candy bars. A lower starch content was found in the yellow banana, signifying greater ripeness. The tomato content of Heinz' ketchup was determined at 212.5%. And a high content of peanut was found in the Snickers bar. The reliability of the peanut test however, was found to be inadequate in this study. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading><heading>Banana (Musa acuminata)</heading>Starch is commonly found in the outermost cells of the fruit, as the product of photosynthesis of these cells (Seymour, 1993). Many young fruits, like apple, pear, tomato, citrus fruits, and banana contain starch. In some fruits an initial increase in starch concentration is followed by a decrease. While in others the starch continually breaks down up to maturity. Banana, which is a climacteric fruit, is amongst the latter. Garcia and Lajolo identified enzymes for both hydrolytic and phosphorolytic breakdown of starch in banana, in 1988 (cited in Seymour, 1993). However, the exact contribution of each is inconclusive. Starch forms about 20-25% of the fresh weight of the pulp of unripe bananas (Whiting, 1970). During ripening this starch is degraded rapidly and the sugars sucrose, glucose and fructose accumulate. At the start of the ripening sucrose is the predominant sugar in banana, preceding the aggregation of glucose and fructose. The peel tissue also contains starch (ca 3% fresh weight) and appears to show similar changes in carbohydrate during ripening (Barnell, 1943, cited in Seymour, 1993). The starch in the banana is an Alcohol Insoluble Solid (AIS) and will in contrast to simple sugars, not dissolve when heated with alcohol. Therefore measuring the AIS content is a good means of measuring the ripeness of a banana. The lower the AIS, the closer the banana is to reaching ripeness, and subsequently over-ripeness. <heading>Ketchup</heading>Ketchup is a tomato product, and as with most products identified as a fruit or vegetable product, there is a legal minimum tomato content that must be met. This study sought to find the tomato content of Heinz' ketchup. A means of measuring the tomato content is to identify one component of tomato which is not found in the other ingredients of ketchup, and then measure the amount of this component present in a sample of the product. As the tomato plant absorbs and utilises a large amount of potassium (K) (Gould, 1983), whilst the other ingredients of tomato ketchup (sugar, salt, vinegar, onions [optional], cloves, cinnamon, allspice, cayenne and garlic [optional] [Lopez, 1969, cited in Gould, 1983]) do not, this was chosen as the specific element to measure the tomato content. Potassium can be measured using a flame photometer. Readings are made on the flame photometer using a stock solution of a known amount of potassium, and a calibration curve is made from the readings. A reading is then made of an unknown sample, which has been ashed and dissolved in concentrated HCI, and the reading is then plotted on a graph with the calibration curve. The potassium content of the ketchup sample can then be read of the graph. <heading>Peanut (Arachishypogaea)</heading>Peanut allergy is one of the more common food allergies, and allergic reactions range from discomfort and itching, to death. It is therefore vital for many people, as well as food producers, to be able to know whether there are peanuts in a specific product. As allergic reactions may be triggered by a mere trace of peanut, it can be problematic to ensure that a product is nut free, as there might be traces left from the production of other peanut products made in the same factory, or previously transported in the same vessel. A technique for measuring peanut content, or traces, in food is the Rapid Antigen based test for Peanuts. This is a quick and simple test to carry out. However it is vital that the instructions are followed for the test results to be reliable. The particles of food need to be crushed thoroughly, so that no particles that may contain traces of nut are missed. The test consists of a collector comb which is dipped into the ground sample, and a main tube-like part which the collector comb in inserted into. There is a screen on this tube, which will display lines at three positions, indicating a negative, positive or high content of peanut, or an invalid result if the test has been overloaded. <heading>Materials and Methods</heading><heading>AIS content of banana</heading>The samples used in this study were: 5.1g mashed pulp from a ripe yellow banana, and 5.05g mashed pulp from an unripe green banana. 100cm 3 Industrial Methylated Spirits (IMS) and an additional 2x50cm 3 IMS for rinsing, and a water bath were used to dissolve the simple sugars. The following calculation was used:  FORMULA  <heading>Tomato content in ketchup</heading>6.8201g Heinz' tomato ketchup and concentrated HCI was used in the analysis of tomato ketchup. The instrument used to measure potassium (K) content was a flame photometer. The following calculation was used:  FORMULA  A value of 290mg K/100g raw tomato was used (Paul and Southgate, 1978) <heading>Peanut content in chocolate bars</heading>To examine the peanut content of chocolate bars a Rapid Antigen based test for Peanuts was used. The samples were taken from a Galaxy chocolate bar and a Snickers bar, which were mashed with a little water. The test was performed three times. However, only one of the three tests produced a result, and this only after a longer time than the 5-6 minutes that were stated on the test instructions. For a detailed description of the three methods please see the U16503 Food Science module handbook pp. 12-14 <heading>Results</heading><table/>The results of the banana analyses are shown in Table 1. As would be expected, there is a higher AIS percentage in the unripe banana than in the ripe banana. The analysis by flame photometry found a 212.5 % tomato content in Heinz' tomato ketchup (See Appendix for details of the calculation). The Rapid Antigen based test for Peanuts found that there was a high content of peanuts in the Snickers bar. There were no results for the Galaxy bar. <heading>Discussion</heading><heading>Banana</heading>The results from the AIS analysis of banana showed a 19.64% starch content in the green banana compared with a 4.44% starch content in the yellow banana. This concurs adequately with the the 20-25% starch content of unripe bananas reported by Whiting (1970). As would be expected, the yellow banana has a considerably lower starch content of 4.44% signifying that it is ripe. <heading>Ketchup</heading>The potassium content of the Heinz' ketchup sample established the tomato content of the ketchup to be 212.5%. This might initially seem to be an impossible value as it exceeds 100%. However, tomato ketchup may be made with concentrated tomato, thus making it possible that the potassium level and therefore the tomato content can exceed 100%. The conclusion of this analysis is therefore that there is a high (212.5%) tomato content in Heinz' ketchup. <heading>Peanuts</heading>The Rapid Antigen based test for Peanuts established a high peanut content in the Snickers chocolate bar. This concurs with the description of the chocolate, which is that it is a chocolate, peanut and caramel bar. However, the test did not show any results for the two previous tests of Snickers and Galaxy. Therefore the reliability of this test may be criticised, as only one in three tests produced a result. However, the fault can not be blamed on the test entirely, as it may alternatively be that the study did not follow the directions accurately. <heading>Conclusion</heading>The three analyses in this study established the tomato content of Heinz' ketchup, the approximate peanut content of Snickers chocolate bar, as well as supporting previous findings that the starch content of banana dissolves as the banana ripens. An significant finding of the study is the importance of precise technique when carrying out food analyses.
