In his statement in Kleinwort Benson Ltd. v Lincoln City Council [1998] 4All ER 513, at 518, Lord Browne-Wilkinson tears apart the traditionaldeclaratory theory of law by suggesting that it is merely, as Lord Reidsaid, 'a fairy tale in which no one any longer believes'. The declaratorytheory suggests that those who deal with the mechanics of the law have nobearing upon its form or content and are mere instruments in the path ofjustice. Their task is not to alter or significantly impact the law, forthat latter is above all individuals and exists irrespective of them.Judges, according to this theory, are not sources of law, but tools throughwhich the law is selectively applied; their duty is restricted to selectionand application, and does not extend to law making.According to this theory, the law exists in the same form all along, and itis for the judge to identify that form and disclose it to others. Theexistence of that form is constant and remains untouched despite the manyapplications of the law by various judges in different cases. When anearlier decision is overruled, the theory reiterates, the law is certainlynot changed or deemed faulty; it is merely made clear, and its relevance ina particular context is illustrated.Besides the direct legal implications, is if often useful to consider thewider historical and philosophical context within which a particular legaltheory has taken root and the ideas that have influenced its development.Interestingly, the position of law within the declaratory theory as a higherbody, a supreme being, the existence or shape of which is not altered by the'coming and going', as it were, of various judges, has significant parallelswith the Platonic "Theory of Forms", with its great insistence upon structureand order. According to Plato, the forms are not concepts in the mind, butare existing realities apart from the mind. For this reason, truth (and, ina sense, for the purpose of this discussion of the declaratory theory, thelaw) is not seen as "either mine or thine but ours, as there for all of usto behold." Thus, a process of externalisation of the law occurs, and, likePlato's concept of the truth, the law begins to be perceived as existing"out there", somewhere, rather than in the private possession of anindividual, creating what Dr. Ziniewicz defines as ''a distance between thethinker and the ideas he pursues'' that ''keeps him humble'', a'humbleness' that may be an essential element of the legal system in ademocratic setup.In the task of discovering and disclosing 'the true nature of the law', thejudge must impartially see the law without attempting to own it. In legalterms, this means that there must be a certain level of consistency, withlike cases being decided on a like basis, rather than being apparentlysubject to the whim of the individual judge deciding the case in question.This is a crucial aspect of formal justice, and not only enables lawyers andtheir clients to predict the likely outcome of a particular legal questionin the light of previous judicial decisions but also allows individuals toorient their behavior with regard to that rule relatively secure in theknowledge that it will not be changed by some later court. This latterpoint is a reminder that law cannot be disassociated from society, uponwhich it has a very direct and constant impact. Any such anomaly in thefunctioning of the legal system will see a corresponding impact on societynot only in terms of, say, an increase in crime, for example, or a widerrange of activities being condemned by the courts as criminal, but also,(and this is perhaps more worrying for society as a whole), in terms of anambiguity about societal perceptions of accepted values and modes ofbehavior, possibly leading to social anarchy. In this sense, justice cannotbe subjective. To rely overwhelmingly upon judicial discretion can have diresocial consequences both immediate and short term, and these will bediscussed subsequently.The doctrine of binding precedent operates in theory to control and indeedlimit the ambit of judicial discretion. As stated by Lord Diplock in Davisv Johnson (1979), a balance must be struck between the need on one side forlegal certainty resulting from the binding effect of previous decisions andon the other side the avoidance of undue restriction on the properdevelopment of law. I will now examine the advantages and disadvantages ofthis system.Besides promoting consistency and certainty in law, as aforementioned, thedoctrine of stare decisis has, for another advantage, efficiency, and, moreoften than not, saves the time of the judiciary, lawyers and their clientsfor the reason that cases do not have to be reargued, besides saving thecourt expenses of potential litigants.On the other hand, paradoxically, case law tends to promote uncertainty dueto the absolute number of cases that have been reported and can be cited asauthorities, and this is compounded by the ability of the judiciary toselect which authority to follow through the use of the mechanism ofdistinguishing cases. Other criticisms of the system include fixity, or thepossibility that the law pertaining to a particular area becomes ossified onthe basis of an unjust precedent, thus perpetuating previous injustices,with the example of marital rape, the possibility of which has only beenrecently recognized (R v R (1992)) . But by far the most serious chargeagainst a judge-centric conception of the legal system is that ofunconstitutionality, or the threat of the judiciary overstepping its''theoretical constitutional role'' by making law rather than simplyapplying it. Doubtless, the greatest threat to liberal democracy is theexistence of an entirely different class of parallel lawmakers, present atevery level and in every jurisdiction, who, without popular backing, havethe potential to take upon themselves the formidable task of legislation,with the control of a deadly tool in their hands: that of the court.In this sense it is not surprising that there have been few adherents inrecent times to a declaratory theory in an absolute form, with its tendencyto limit innovation and ignore the role of individual judges and theircontributions. As in any analysis, it is vital not to disregard thehistorical aspect; every common law rule must originally have been made by aperson or a group of people, and cannot be subject to infinite regression.The declaratory theory seems, in a sense, to provide a cover, a mask forreality, by keeping the judge within the bounds of what is technicallyacceptable while allowing him substantial power to in effect change the law.Judges, in reality, are actively involved in the reform and creation oflaw, even if it not overtly. Those who assert that judges have no place inreforming statutory provisions must realize, to use the words of Windeyer J,that "[l]aw is to be accommodated to changing facts".In 1956 in his speech in Lister v Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd, LordRadcliffe said:"No one really doubts that the common law is a body of law which develops inprocess of time in response to the developments of the society in which itrules. Its movement may not be perceptible at any distinct point of time,nor can we always say how it gets from one point to another; but I do notthink that, for all that, we need abandon the conviction of Galileo thatsomehow, by some means, there is a movement that takes place."As illustrated above, and considering the existence of the intrinsicself-regulating mechanisms of overruling and distinguishing that allow thelaw to modernize itself, and the relative ease with which they enable judgesto manipulate the common law to achieve the ends they desire, both in aparticular case as well as for the purpose of establishing precedent andsubsequently impacting public opinion, it must be admitted that even withinthe limited system of binding precedent, there is an inherent flexibilitythat exists. Would it not be, then, rather incorrect, or atleast a mildexaggeration, to state that case law promotes injustice, rigidity andhampers modernization of the law? I believe that it would, and that the fewdisadvantages of case law do not outweigh its many advantages.Thus, though the theoretical position critiqued by Lord Browne-Wilkinson andReid is al policy, and reflects a highly sterile view of law as divorcedfrom the judge, it is certainly an exaggeration to suggest, as in the lattersection of the statement, that the whole of the common law is judge made andretains its dynamism only through judicial change, in the light of thearguments above.
