<heading>Introduction</heading>This investigation will look into the species diversity of insects at four different sites. The sites are in close proximity to one another, but provide a variety of different niches. Four sites were sampled at the Rennes field centre in Brittany, France. Site one was at the top of a slope, it was a dry area open to lots of day-light. The ground was rocky and covered in clumps of Gorse, Broom and Bell heather, these plants are spiny and prickly so can provide some protection from predators. Site two was at the bottom of the slope, it was a flat area covered in short grasses and bare mud patches. Site three was lower than site two so was a bit wetter and the grass was long. Site four was very wet and had a stream running through it, the plants were lush wetland plants and grasses. On the morning of July that the samples were collected the weather was warm and sunny. The expected results would be for the sites with the most varied niches to have the highest diversity. This would be sites 3 and 4 as they have long grass providing niches for ground insects and those that prefer to live on grasses away from the ground. Site 1 may also have high species diversity, as there are many bushy plants that can support and protect a variety of insect species from the ground to the branches and on the foliage. <heading>Method</heading>At each of the four sites the samples will be taken using the same method. A sweep net will be used and an area of 10m 2 will be covered at each site. The insects caught in the net will then be collected up by sucking them into tubes using a pooter. In order to be able to identify the insects under a microscope they will be put in a freezer for a few hours so that they are killed and will not move under inspection. The identified insects will be put into groups according to their Family. The species diversity will then be calculated using the Shannon-Weiner diversity index. The equation is  FORMULA  In order to see whether there is an even distribution between the species in one site, the equitability will be calculated,  FORMULA   FORMULA  F is the total number of families found The results will be combined with the results from other sampling attempts so that averages can be taken. <heading>Results</heading>Spiders and mites have been included in the results although they are not families of the class Insecta. They have been included because they were abundant in the samples taken from each site and come from a similar trophic level to most of the insects. <table/> FORMULA   FORMULA  <table/> FORMULA   FORMULA  <table/> FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  <table/> FORMULA   FORMULA  <table/><table/><table/><table/><table/><table/><heading>Discussion</heading>The results taken from the combined results confirmed the predictions made before the experiment. Site 4 had the highest species diversity, this was the wetland site so provided both wet and dry niches along with ground and plant niches. Also it provides water and lots of hiding places from predators. This means that a variety of insects can find somewhere to live, whether herbivores or predators. Site four had a large number of different species of Diptera, these are the true flies. Their abundance may be due to the fact that a large number of fly larvae are aquatic, therefore they may have just hatched from their puparium or they may be near the stream and wetlands so that they may mate and lay their eggs. Site two had the lowest species diversity, this can be explained when considering the ground cover, it was sparse amounts of short grass. This does not supply a wide variety of niches or much cover from predators such as other carnivorous insects or birds. Also there is not much variety of food with few plants and not much water. Site two was the only site where Formicidae were found, these are ants, the site may have provided them with a good place to have their burrows, as they live under ground. Also ants travel quite a distance in search of food so this area may have been an easy route to cross with few obstructions. Site one, three and four all had grasses and bushes, these provide good cover and a food source for insects, however this cover prevents the sweep net from collecting a thorough sample of the insects at the sites. This means that the samples are probably not representative of the real species diversities. An improvement to the sampling attempt would be to use a variety of methods. Another problem caused by the bushes and grasses is that it makes the test area three-dimensional instead of fairly two-dimensional as site two was. This means that the area covered by the sweep net on the more three-dimensional sites would be much larger.
