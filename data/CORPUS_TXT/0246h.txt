She was admitted for 2-3 days and was subsequently discharged. On arrival, Mrs  was able to maintain her airway. She was dyspnoeic and tachycardic with an adequate blood pressure (154/72). Mrs  was moving all four limbs and localising sources of pain, she was not responding to a commands. Mrs  had not been incontinent whilst in her bed or on her arrival to the MAU. There were no obvious signs of trauma. <heading>Past Medical History</heading><list>COPD - on home oxygenHyperparathyroidismAtrial fibrillationPrevious MICongestive Cardiac FailureRecurrent UTIsPoor mobilityNo history of diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy, asthma,, stroke or TB. </list><heading>Medication</heading><list>Ramipril - 2.5mg odLactulose - 20ml bdAspirin - 75mg odDigoxin - 125Âµg odFurosemide - 40mg odAmitryptiline - 10mg odNefopan - 30mg 2 tablets tdsCombivent inhalers</list>No known drug allergies <heading>Family History</heading>There is no significant family history. <heading>Social History</heading>Mrs lives in a nursing home.

The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>Based on the acute symptoms Mrs  presented with, the differential diagnoses of collapse, verbally unresponsive in a COPD patient are: Collapse secondary to CO2 retention: given Mrs 's history of COPD, her dyspnoea, drowsiness, tachycardia and confusion fit with this diagnosis. Collapse secondary to Stroke/TIA: the risk factors of her age and previous coronary events coupled with her acute presentation and weakness could be indicative of a stroke. Lower respiratory tract infection Left Ventricular Failure/Congestive Cardiac Failure On physical examination, it is important to assess the level of Mrs 's responsiveness from the GCS assessment. Her vital signs should be assessed, particularly her oxygen saturations and blood gases. An examination should assess her cardiovascular and respiratory status, listening for crackles and air entry. <heading>Physical examination and mental state examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading>On general examination, Mrs was drowsy and non-rousable. She did not respond verbally but would respond to painful stimuli with moans. She would open her eyes after persistent commands. Mrs  had cold peripheries and her capillary refill was 3 seconds. There were no signs of jaundice, clubbing or lymphadenopathy. Mrs  was very pale and was cyanosed.

A collapse secondary to an infective exacerbation of COPD leading to Type II respiratory failure and CO2 retention is the most likely diagnosis. Her O 2 saturations indicate she has poor respiratory function and an ABG will help determine her respiratory state. Tachycardia, confusion, drowsiness and central cyanosis all support this diagnosis. The presence of crackles bilaterally would indicate a possible respiratory tract infection which may have precipitated Mrs 's collapse. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>Physical - Mrs  found it difficult to mobilise herself prior to admission. She has had repeated falls, one of which she was admitted for. She is becoming progressively more unsteady on her feet. This is putting her at increase risk of further falls and consequently reducing her physical state further. As a result of her COPD, Mrs  is unable to walk without O 2; this further limits her physical ability. Her immobility increases the risk of retaining respiratory secretions predisposing Mrs  to chest infections. Psychological - On admission, Mrs  was verbally unresponsive but following admission and some degree of recovery she became upset regarding about her poor mobility and loss of independence. Mrs  exhibited a fear about her death. Social - Mrs 's social situation is stable and well supported. She gets full-time care from her nursing home and requires help dressing, washing and some support mobilising. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management. Refer to the guidelines to the writing of portfolio cases for the details of the issues to be addressed under each heading.</heading><heading>Investigations</heading>Mrs 's ABG results on  were as follows: <table/>The pH level of 7.130 indicates an acidosis, a raised pCO 2 of 20.57kPa illustrates pCO 2 retention and a pO 2 of6.70 confirms the presence of hypoxia, indicating Type II respiratory failure caused by alveolar hypoventilation. These results support Mrs 's clinical picture. Chest X-Ray No indication of infection seen. <heading>Reassurance and Explanation</heading>To appropriately reassure Mrs  and her family I would say: "As you know, Mrs  has been suffering from COPD for many years now making it difficult for her to breathe. There are a number of reasons why she may have collapsed and we would like to investigate them all. It is most likely that she has collapsed as a complication to her COPD and we will carry out some tests to find out exactly the best way to treat her. At the moment we will give her restricted oxygen (2-4L), antibiotics and fluids. As Mrs  has been deteriorating recently and has been in hospital a number of times now for a similar admission we are not sure how she will respond to this admission". To explain the nature of the disease:"COPD is a disease of the airways and it becomes increasingly more difficult for you to get oxygen in to your lungs, which limits the amount of oxygen getting to your vital organs and muscles. As your condition gets worse it is more difficult for you to expel CO 2, which can cause the problems you have experienced when it gets retained in your blood". To describe the management plan: "We will keep Mrs  in hospital and monitor her blood gases and oxygen saturations closely giving her oxygen and fluids. We will get a chest X-ray to look for any signs of an infection. We will have to wait and see how well she responds to her oxygen and fluids". <heading>Prescription/Medical Intervention</heading>Mrs  was prescribed augmentin for a possible chest infection on admission. She was given oxygen 2L via a face mask. A urinary catheter was fitted. <heading>Observation</heading>Following admission from MAU, Mrs  was transferred to a ward where her saturations were monitored. Over the following days she became more responsive and was helped to sit in a chair whilst on oxygen. <heading>Referral and Team Working</heading>Mrs  was not referred to any further care once she was admitted. The team based on the ward of nurses, doctors and care assistants need to liaise with each other regarding the progress of Mrs . Each of these teams also needs to relay information back to the family so that they can remain fully informed about Ms 's health. <heading>Advice and Prevention</heading>Advice should be given with regards to looking after the terminally ill family members. The family may also require advice on bereavement and counselling services. <heading>Outcome A description of the progress of the patient as far as possible. This should include consideration of further issues to be resolved. Where appropriate you should contact by telephone patients who have been discharged home.</heading>Mrs  was admitted to the ward and began responding verbally but remained unable to mobilise. Sadly, Mrs  passed away 2 days after her admission to the ward. <heading>Evidence based care and issues for research A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s)</heading>Respiratory failure occurs when there is an inadequate gas exchange, which results in hypoxia (pO 2 <8kPa). Respiratory failure is subdivided into two types according to the pCO 2. Type I Respiratory Failure is defined as hypoxia (pO 2 <8kPa) with a normal or low pCO 2. It is primarily caused by a ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Type II Respiratory Failure is defined as hypoxia with hypercapnia (pCO 2 > 6.5kPa). It is caused by alveolar hypoventilation with or without ventilation/perfusion mismatch. (1) The management of respiratory failure includes the administration of supplemental oxygen, the control of secretions, the treatment of any underlying pulmonary infection, the control of any bronchospasm and measures to limit pulmonary oedema. The management principles are: treat the underlying disease physiotherapy oxygen therapy - try to maintain pO 2 > 8 kPa bronchodilators and steroids if there is airways obstruction in some circumstances, respiratory stimulants such as i.v. doxapram 1-4 mg / min, may be indicated if the pCO 2 begins to rise if arterial O 2 continues to deteriorate or fails to improve then some form of respiratory support should be considered long-term management should be aimed at the underlying cause of the condition e.g. COPD <heading>Oxygen Therapy in Respiratory Failure:</heading>Type 1 failure - treat with unrestricted oxygen therapy i.e. 35+ %; blood gases should be repeated after 20 mins to ensure correction of PaO 2 and absence of a significant rise in PaCO 2. Type 2 failure and COPD - give 24% O2. Monitor PaCO 2 closely by blood gas measurement; if it rises by more than 1 kPa, consider ventilation. The concentration of oxygen is important to patients with chronic bronchitis and chronically elevated PaCO 2 - as these patients rely on hypoxic drive to maintain respiratory effort, it is dangerous to give supplemental oxygen without careful observation as hypoventilation or apnoea may result. Blood gases must be monitored regularly. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>An important issue raised in this case was the issue of resuscitation in the event of a cardiac arrest. Mrs  had been deteriorating steadily over the past few months and her respiratory function is poor. On previous occasions her family had been notified that it was difficult to predict whether she would recover. On her admission this time, Mrs  was in a similar position and at risk of a cardiac arrest and it was a sensitive issue that needed to be discussed with the family. This case highlighted the issues of health care delivery to patients who may not benefit from further medical intervention and how to approach this issue with the family. Mrs  was fully dependent on care, had restricted mobility and struggling with a progressive terminal illness. The decision was taken not to resuscitate in the event of a cardiac arrest on the basis of a reduced quality of life. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading><list>Acute presentation of COPDManagement of an unresponsive patient.Breaking bad newsEthical issues of resuscitation and further medical intervention in critically ill patients.
