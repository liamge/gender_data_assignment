In his 1813 masterpiece Peter Schlemihl, the German poet Aldebert von Chamisso compared citizens lacking a nation to a man lacking his shadow. Nations and nationalism have indeed long been considered vital to our identities. As the current abundance of separatist movements suggests (the ETA in Spain, the Kurds in Iraq, or the Tamils in Sri Lanka), following its inception with the 1789 French Revolution and its gradual spread outside of Europe through anti-colonial struggles, nationalism remains a dominant political force today. What explains this potency? To quote historian Benedict Anderson, "what makes people love and die for nations, as well as hate and kill in their name?" Many attribute the ideology's force to its reliance on the psychological impacts of shared language, ethnicity, religion and history. Others, however, see "the apparent universal ideological domination of nationalism [as an] optical illusion", and argue that nationalism is declining in today's globalizing world. Will this ideology remain influential throughout the 21 st Century? By investigating what factors have fostered nationalism in the past, and by assessing to what extent nationalism's flaws are today undermining its bases, one may ascertain whether "the flesh and blood of populations [will] still [be] swayed by appeals to their national character" in coming years. <fnote>Gellner, Ernest.

Since then, nationalism has emphasized self-determination, holding that "the political and national unit should be congruent" and that people of a like nation should be united under the same government. What, though, constitutes a nation? Many claim that a shared language particularly fosters national belonging. Certain groups, such as Canada's Francophones in Quebec, are indeed highly sensitive to the dissolution of their language; nevertheless, language alone cannot define a nation. Different dialects may coexist within a country - in Switzerland French, Italian, are German are all official languages - without damaging its sense of nationalism. Furthermore, for Eric Hobsbawm, "national languages are almost always semi-artificial constructs", as, far from being a national culture's primary foundation, a common language is obtained only after the painstaking selection and standardisation of particular dialects. In France in 1789, only 20% of the population spoke French, and when Italy unified in 1860, only 2.5% spoke Italian; while such languages are today essential to citizens' national identity, they therefore cannot define 'national belonging' on their own. <fnote>Heywood, Andrew.

Pg. 119. </fnote>Indeed, other criteria enjoy equal importance in fostering nationalism. Religion can for instance supersede the influence of common language (as Ireland's Catholic-Protestant divide illustrates) or the obstacles of disparate geography (Islam, notably, forges national identity in both North Africa and the Middle East). However, even religion cannot justify all nationalist sentiments - numerous religions often peacefully coexist within countries, as in Poland where Orthodox, Uniate and Roman Catholic beliefs intermingle. Ethnicity, likewise, is only one component of nationalism: whilst it can heighten nationalistic divisions by categorically distinguishing 'insiders' from 'outsiders', ethnic groups - such as the Basques or the Kurds - often cut across states. Nationalism thus rests on a wide range of shared human attributes, which vary according to country. Beyond this, nationalism's most important contributor, Hobsbawm argues, is a state's "historical cement", or its possession of a celebrated common past. By "[binding] people together by . . . common language, religion, history, and [their] occupation of the same geographical area", nationalism has thus generated considerable support throughout history. <fnote>Heywood, Andrew.

Pg. 158. </fnote>Nationalism's force does not rest merely on these objective, fixed components of nationhood, however; the ideology has in fact gained power by superseding these criteria and moving beyond the exclusive view of nationality as unchangeable and given. More inclusive concepts argue that nations can be multicultural - they are 'organic communities', open to individuals not solely if they share the same culture, but more importantly "if they recognise each other as belonging to the same nation". This situationalist approach to nationalism grants the ideology more flexibility and potency: by relying more on the development of civic consciousness and patriotism than on birth-inherited characteristics to unite individuals, it extends nationalistic sentiments to any group of citizens faced by common historical challenges. Nationalism, having emerged in the 1800's as a source of cultural cohesion amidst the vicious self-striving of industrialization, could therefore enjoy a new lease of life in today's destabilizing era of globalization and cultural threat. <fnote>Smith, Andrew.

Pg. 4. </fnote>Nationalistic feelings, therefore, are considerably reinforced by psychological ideals of unity and communion, as well as by notions of shared ethnical, cultural and religious heritage. But these factors cannot alone explain how "a concept so remote from the real experiences of human beings as 'national patriotism' . . . has become such a powerful political force". Numerous political scientists attribute much of nationalism's strength not to populations themselves, but to government efforts to "politically engineer" nationalist sentiment. Similarly to Marx, who viewed nationalism as a mechanism through which capitalist elites 'tamed' the masses, Ernest Gellner claims that governments use nationalism to obtain "political legitimacy"; likewise, Andrew Smith maintains that nationalist sentiments are "promoted by political actors to provide coherence and purpose for political movements". Historically, numerous governments have indeed sought to foster national cohesion by 'inventing tradition': Europe in particular "mass-produc[ed] traditions" between 1870 and 1914 - in Germany, for instance, the Brothers Grimm's folkloric tales and Wagner's mythology-inspired operas were designed to give citizens a sense of historical unity. Likewise, Scotland's 'Highland Tradition', Welsh culture's revival during the Romantic Period, and the colonial customs of Victorian India arguably all resulted from such 'engineering'. As Gellner concludes, "nationalism is not the awakening of nations to self-consciousness: it invents nations where they do not exist." If nationalism has remained politically powerful for so long, it may be due to governments' manufacturing of nationalistic sentiment - to their creation of "imagined communities". <fnote>Heywood, Andrew.

Investigating the ideology's different historical variants suggests that it is dangerously influential - since the French Revolution, nationalism has repeatedly been misused to secure specific governmental aims. Even liberal nationalism, the ideology's oldest form, establishes a dangerous distinction between 'us' and 'others' that has since fostered xenophobia and - in the case of Nazi Germany - even genocide. Expansionist nationalism carries a similarly aggressive potential: following the 19 th Century collapse of the Ottoman, Hapsburg and Tsarist empires, this strand of nationalism transformed European nation-building into uncompromising 'jingoist' projects of imperial conquest. As European powers competed for colonial control, the ideology's militaristic approach fostered intense patriotism based on "martial principles of absolute loyalty, complete dedication and willing self-sacrifice" for the nation, precipitating the outbreak of the two World Wars. Having spread to Africa and Asia through independence struggles in the 20 th Century, nationalism is today gaining a conservative slant: its focus has largely shifted from issues of self-determination to prospects of social cohesion and public order. Such conservative nationalism has however also been misused - its xenophobic claims to protect domestic populations against the 'outside world' have for instance backed both the 1981 Falklands War and the USA's ongoing 'war on terror'. Visibly, past nationalist movements have not solely upheld Rousseau's virtues of freedom and self-representation - rather, nationalism's popularity as a tool of manipulation for political elites confirms the tremendous potency and psychological impact of nationalistic appeals. <fnote>Hobsbawm, Eric.

Pg. 166. </fnote>If nationalism's promises of altruism and unity are so often contradicted by evidence of its moral flaws, how does this bode for the ideology's future? Will nationalism remain politically powerful throughout this century? For Hobsbawm, "nationalism . . . is simply no longer the historical force it [once] was". Gellner predicts the ideology's dissolution based on both its ethical blemishes and its intellectual contradictions - he sees nationalism's key tenet, that each nation should possess its own state, as untenable because "the number of potential nations on earth is much, much larger than the amount of possible viable states". Moreover, as nationalism's prime goal has today largely been achieved (most separatist movements have been satisfied) he suggests that nationalist struggles, rather than providing a "global programme", are now merely "reactions of weakness and fear to . . . keep at bay the forces of the modern world". This modern world, with its increased migration, its threats to state sovereignty imposed by supranational institutions and transnational corporations, and its emerging cosmopolitan community, may indeed be rendering nationalism obsolete. Nevertheless, theorists such as Andrew Smith insist that, in a "disintegrating society" of disorienting global change, nationalism, with its reassuring promise of "collective faith, dignity and hope", should gain unmatched appeal. Nationalism's prospects of power in a globalizing environment remain hotly debated. <fnote>Hobsbawm, Eric. Nations and Nationalism Since 1780. Cambridge University Press, 1990.

Pg. 162. </fnote>One of politics' oldest ideologies, nationalism has impacted governments' and individuals' actions since the 18 th Century, due both to its appeal to sentiments of shared culture and history and to elites' 'engineering' of national tradition. Today, however, as the historically detrimental consequences of nationalist actions are exposed, the ideology may be losing its appeal. As argued by Hobsbawm, in a globalizing world where geopolitical boundaries are losing importance, "the economic and political developments which were so conducive to [nationalism's] formation... [may] render [it] obsolete". Some theorists nonetheless insist that "it would be folly to predict an early supersession of nationalism", as the ideology's role in maintaining social cohesion and political legitimation render nationalism essential even to today's governments. How credible is this view? According to Andrew Heywood, "few political ideologies have been forced to endure prophecies of their eminent demise for as long as nationalism". Hobsbawm's prediction, like many before it, could indeed be mistaken; only the coming decades can determine whether nationalism's political power will survive in this century. <fnote>Smith, Andrew.
