<abstract><heading>Executive Summary</heading>The 2005 annual report is confirmed by the auditors as a true and fair account of the financial status of Renold. The evaluation of the annual report by the author of this report confirms this finding. Out of the ten performance ratios considered they all show the effects of a hard year for Renold. Adjustments made are consistent with company policy and the accounts read transparently. On 7 th April 2005 Renold issued a second profit warning in as many months. Following close after the issue of the annual report this could be taken to indicate that management had failed to realise the full impact of the increased cost of raw materials would have upon their customer base. In fact Renold were in the red for the first six months of this financial year. Difficulties in the automotive industry in particular with lower orders than expected from GM, have added to Renold's problems.  <fnote>Financial Times (London) 07 April 2005, Lisa Urquhart, p26 </fnote><fnote>Financial Times (London) 13 December 2005, David Blackwell, p25 </fnote>Management are having little success in passing on cost increases to the automotive industry. The cost reduction programme, by moving manufacture to Poland continues, but talks on starting production in China are still underway. Share prices were 59p in April 2005 following the second Renold profit warning and only dropped to 58.5 p in December 2005 despite the companies continuing problems. With no further share dividends paid since January 28 th 2005 this would not be a good time to purchase more shares in the company. Therefore the recommendation would be to hold on to existing shares at this time. If the China talks are successful there is the possibility that Renold's position in 2006 could be greatly improved, especially if debts can also be reduced (by the sale of the Burton-on-Trent plant) as Renold management expect and the current strong order book continues. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>Renold, a company specialising in the manufacture of gears, chains and other power transmission systems, have been undergoing a period of change over the last few years. Profit levels have varied as the company has strived to survive in a competitive market, beset by disadvantageous US Dollar exchange rates, increasing raw material costs and falls in volume production in the automotive industry. This report reviews the 2004/2005 annual report and considers the companies performance over that period, with a view to determining whether the accounts give a true and fair view, and ultimately whether investors should consider buying, selling or maintaining their current share platform. <heading>Objectives</heading>The objectives of this review are: to review the Renold 2005 Annual Report to consider any relevant subsequent releases from the web or other public sources calculate and compare ten specific accounting ratios evaluate the performance of Renold using these ratios search for and evaluate relevant financial performance relating to the period since issue of the annual report (31 st March 2005) to review the trade debtors collection period ratio against Renold's peers determine and justify whether the information provided in the annual report is "true and fair." provide advice to existing or potential shareholders as to whether they should increase, decrease or maintain their current level of investment. <heading>Analysis and Discussions</heading><heading>Profitability Ratios</heading>These ratios relate the profitability of an entity, in context with its size. <heading>Return on Shareholders' Equity</heading><table/><figure/><heading>Justification :</heading>This ratio illustrates how much profit could be distributed to the shareholders as a proportion of what they invested. The higher the ratio, the more capital can be released for payment of share dividend. This is important to any investor as they would wish to receive as large a return on their investment as possible. <heading>Analysis :</heading>Analysis of the performance over the five years is difficult due to the adjustments made for pension liability. The return on shareholders equity fell in 2002 after that year's poor performance, but steadily increased again in 2003 and 2004. The adjustments made for pension liability in 2005 resulted in lower profits leading to the poor ratio for this year. <heading>Return on Capital Employed</heading><table/><figure/><heading>Justification:</heading>This ratio records how profitable an entity has been in relation to the investment required to have funded it. This indicates how efficiently managers have used the investments put into the entity to generate profit, with a higher positive ratio suggesting a stronger position., <fnote>'Accounting for Non-Accounting Students' by J.R. Dyson, 6th edition, Pearson education Limited 2004, p254 </fnote><fnote>Finance and Accounting (ES 379), University of Warwick </fnote><heading>Analysis:</heading>Using any of the three ratio calculations, Renold performed badly in 2002 and 2005. This last year Renold suffered from a poor profit (loss) due to factors including the acquisitions and steep rise in material costs. Investors would want a value that was both positive, and also offered a reasonable alternative to investment in a bank. This means that the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) should track significantly above bank interest rates to encourage investors to take on the risks associated with investing in stocks as opposed to in banks. The current rate of 4-5% is not significantly above bank interest rates. <heading>Liquidity Ratios</heading>The Liquidity Ratios tell you the extent to which assets can quickly be turned into cash - i.e. how much cash the company has available at short notice. <heading>Acid-Test</heading><table/><figure/><heading>Justification:</heading>As opposed to the basic current assets ratio, the acid-test does not consider stocks as assets as technically they are worth more than their monetary value, since they generate the profit within the entity. As a guide the minimum ratio should be 1:1. This will be lower than the current assets ratio, and a fairer guide, as stocks are hard to turn into cash immediately. The Acid-Test ratio will be: <quote>"This ratio is the most stringent measure of how well the company is covering its short-term obligations, since the ratio only considers that part of current assets which can be turned into cash immediately (thus the exclusion of inventories). The ratio tells creditors how much of the company's short term debt can be met by selling all of the company's liquid assets at very short notice." </quote><fnote>( URL ) </fnote>A ratio of less than 1:1 might indicate a difficulty in meeting payments, whilst a higher value could indicate that resources are not being managed efficiently. <heading>Analysis:</heading>The consistent rise from 0.83 in 2001, through to the current value of 1.02 at the close of 2005 suggests Renold's ability to recover liquid assets on demand to be improving. Further improvement would not be beneficial as it may be an indication of inefficient management of resources. <heading>Efficiency Ratios</heading>These reflect upon how well an entity is being managed, and how well its resources are being looked after. <heading>Fixed Assets Turnover</heading><table/><figure/><heading>Justification:</heading>This ratio is described as "how many times a company achieves, or turns over the book value of fixed assets in net sales." The more times that the fixed assets are covered by turnover, the greater the recovery of investment in fixed assets. Lower ratios indicate that the entity is capital intensive, requiring higher amounts of fixed assets to generate sales. Generally the trend is for this ratio to increase, as turnover is expected to remain stable, or gradually increase, whist fixed assets will be depreciated. However the trend will be affected by replacement of fixed assets, often at different rates and intervals. Investors would want to know that any investments in fixed assets are being used efficiently to generate a suitable increase in turnover. <fnote>, 11 Gildersleeve, R. (1999) Winning Business, Gulf Professional Publishing, p136 </fnote><quote>"Managers and investors can use this indicator to determine the level of fixed asset investment required to produce every pound of net sales, and to learn how these investment levels have changed over time. This indicator can also be used to forecast fixed asset requirements based on expected future net sales levels."  </quote><fnote></fnote><heading>Analysis:</heading>The upward trend can be observed in Renold's accounts, although there was a slight fall in 2001-2002, largely due to a sharp fall in turnover. An entity can however falsify this ratio by selling off some of its fixed assets. Renold has not done this in recent years, though they are expecting to realise funds from the closure/selling of the Burton-on-Trent site in 2005/2006. Renold has continued to restructure during 2005, involving opening a new plant in the States and purchasing Sachs Automotive France SAS. The fixed assets have therefore increased during 2005 whilst the ratio has continued to rise. This ratio indicates an improving position for Renold. <heading>Trade Debtor Collection Period</heading><table/><figure/><heading>Justification:</heading>Generous credit terms might lead to a shortage of funds, so it is good to know how long on average it takes an entity to recover payments on any credit sales. A shortage of funds would lead to concerns that an entity may not have enough cash to pay its own debts whilst waiting for payments to come in. The average trade debtor collection period within the UK is around 50 days. This value varies largely upon the market sector and can therefore only be taken in context when compared to market peers. <fnote>Dyson, J.R. (2004) Accounting for Non-Accounting Students, 6th edition, Pearson education Limited, page 260 </fnote><table/><fnote>Bureau Van DIJK (2006) Fame Financial Database, Electronic Publishing </fnote>The table above contains the trade debtors collection period for Renold and a select 18 peers, as chosen from the Fame database. Due to the disparity of dates at which point these ratios were taken, a graph is included showing the spread of values and their date. There could be a slight downward trend but this can be ignored as any trend is negligible and the majority of data is from the same period. A chart showing the ratios corresponding to the peer companies is included in Appendix 1. <figure/><heading>Analysis:</heading>There is not an increasing trend, rather just a variance of a couple of days across the five year period. There is scope for improvement but would require Renold to take positive action. It appears that Renold are content with the current situation, seeing no need to change it. Indeed, Renold does no have a discouraging ratio when compared to its peers, although the company does find itself in the upper half of the group. A couple of the peer companies have a very small trade debtor collection period (e.g. NSK Bearings Europe Limited just 0.62 days). This may be due to the structure of the group that the company belongs to. The average of this peer group is 48.56, just below the national average. <heading>Trade Creditor Payment Period</heading><table/><figure/><heading>Justification:</heading>Trade creditor collection period is a measure of the average time taken for an entity to make payment on its credit purchases. Turnover is often used in place of credit purchases, as information distinguishing cash and credit purchases is rarely given. If a long time is taken to make these payments, it might suggest problems within the company to finance these payments pointing to a shortage of cash. <fnote>"Accounting for Non-Accounting Students" by JR Dyson, 6th edition, page 260 </fnote><heading>Analysis:</heading>Over the five year period from 2001 to 2005, there is a definite upward trend. Only the year 2002-2003 did not follow this pattern, but there was only a negligible decrease of 0.14 days. The fact that the trade creditor payment period continues to increase, implies that Renold is finding it increasingly more difficult to raise the necessary cash to make payments. Companies may of course be extending more generous credit terms to Renold to ensure their continued custom, in the belief that Renold has a sound financial situation. Renold in turn might be delaying payments to maximise interest within its accounts, again with the knowledge that suppliers are likely to accept this because of the size of Renold's custom and the influence that comes with it. All three of these could be valid explanations for the increasing trend. This ratio alone cannot tell the whole story and more analysis must be carried out to build a true picture. <heading>Investment Ratios</heading>These are primarily of interest to investors, so would surely be of interest to existing and potential shareholders. <heading>Dividend Cover</heading><table/><figure/><heading>Justification:</heading>Dividend cover displays the number of times that the ordinary dividend could be paid from current earnings. A cover of two times would mean that half of the earnings are needed to be paid out as dividends. A limitation of this ratio is such that when an entity records a loss, no earnings are available but still a dividend is often paid. This displays as a negative value, since there is no profit to cover the dividend. <heading>Analysis:</heading>For the years that Renold has recorded a profit, the dividend cover has been around one. This means that Renold has had the money to pay off the dividends. For two years however, a loss has been recorded, and the cover has fallen as far as -5.2. This was the case for the interim dividend paid out in 2005, although a decision was made not to pay out a further dividend that year. For growth, a company must retain some profit once dividends have been paid, and so only a ratio above 1 can achieve this. The years that this was not achieved, 2002 and the last financial year, 2005, large investments were made. This last year, the hike in material costs has negatively affected any profit (loss) and can explain the recent fall away without reflection upon the entity itself. Without a return to profitability and a marked improvement in this ratio in 2006 it is likely that very small or no dividends will be payable in 2006. <heading>Earnings per share</heading><table/><table/><figure/><table/><heading>Justification:</heading>The Earnings per Share (EPS) ratio puts profit into a meaningful context for the shareholder, and not absolute terms. This allows for a good comparison for year to year earnings. Investors would be interested in earnings displaying 'steady, non-volatile, growth'  <fnote>Walsh, C. Key Management Ratios, page 162 </fnote><heading>Analysis:</heading>The diluted earnings calculated show a far from steady growth over the five years, with two sharp falls in price sandwiching a period of growth between 2002 and 2004. This period of growth may of course be coincidental, and the absence of any discernable trend would alarm investors looking for steady increasing earnings. <heading>Price / Earnings</heading><figure/><heading>Justification:</heading>This compares the earnings per share, to the market price per share, displaying the market price as  FORMULA  times the earnings. It is therefore years before the market value would be recovered through the earnings, assuming current rates remain constant. A higher P/E suggests that the market believes the future of the entity to be a good one. <heading>Analysis:</heading>The performance of Renold when measured by this ratio is quite varied. A global increase in material costs around 40% and a large number of investments that have been made this year have all contributed to the profit (loss) recorded by Renold this year. Amongst these are the acquisitions of Sachs Automotive France SAS, and Jones & Shipman, as well as the rationalisation of the Burton facility. The current downward trend of this ratio is unlikely to encourage new investors to buy shares in Renold. <heading>Gearing</heading><table/><figure/><heading>Justification:</heading>The gearing ratio is a comparison between the company's borrowings, and the net worth of the company, the shareholders' funds. A low ratio is achieved by a company that relies more upon its equity, whereas a higher ratio would suggest that the company is tending to over borrow. The ratio gives as a percentage the proportions of capital within the company to that which the company owes to outside creditors. A higher ratio is more risky when there are high interest rates, or if the company is suffering from low profitability. The increase in loans may yield an increase in profit greater than the additional interest due. If this is the case then investors can expect a greater return. Conversely, an increase in loans might indicate current lack of funds, or a conceivable lack of funds in the future. <heading>Analysis:</heading>Companies that rely strongly upon tangible assets such as machinery are prone to higher ratios, and Renold's gearing ratio for the years 2001-2004 is pretty much as one would expect, around 100. This is compared to the average gearing in the automotive industry (also reliant upon these fixed assets) of 130. This indicates that the company has a healthy amount of capital available compared to the funds that are owed to external creditors. The sudden and significant rise in the past year suggests a high level of borrowing. The shareholders' funds however, a measure of the net worth of the company, has halved due to the deduction of the FRS 17 pension deficit of £41.3m. The sharp increase in gearing should not be considered out of context then, as borrowing has not significantly altered in the last financial year, and financial adjustments seem to explain this away, suggesting an otherwise consistent performance with the gearing ratio. <heading>Discussion</heading>The annual report covers a period when accounting standards have changed. Whilst Renold  have attempted to explain the changes and provide the accounts for both systems (before and after the adoption of Financial Reporting Standard 17 "Retirement Benefits") this could conceivably have confused ordinary shareholders rather than assisting them. Comparison with previous year's accounts was not straightforward due to these changes. <fnote>Renold PLC, (2005) Annual Report 2005, page 51 </fnote>Forthcoming through the introduction of international accounting standards may further complicate comparison of past and future reports. This will cost Renold as the financial staff will be required to retrain to be able to work within the new standards. In terms of does the annual report provide a true and fair view of the companies performance it is noted: - The performance ratios selected show that Renold has struggled this year, with profit having a negative effect upon the majority of ratios. Other ratios (for instance fixed assets turnover) show Renold to be improving in some aspects of it's management. The report provides reasons for low profitability (high material costs, poor US Dollar exchange rates) and action the company is taking (LEAN manufacturing, moving manufacturing to cheaper locations, opening plant in the US to avoid currency conversion 'losses') to alleviate the position. 'One off' costs such as redundancy, pension and restructuring, are all included. Plans for future expansion (including recent purchase of Sachs Automotive France SAS and opening a plant in China) are discussed as one way to access new and potentially very large markets. Therefore the information covers past/existing issues and management plans for dealing with them. One adjustment made within the Annual Report is the depreciation cost, arising to £8.7m for the last financial year. Freehold properties - 80 years; land is not depreciated Leasehold properties - 80 years or the period of the lease if less Equipment (including plant and machinery) - 5 to 25 years according to type of asset Motor vehicles - 25% per annum for 3 years leaving 25% residual value <fnote>Renold PLC, (2005) Annual Report 2005, page 27 </fnote>That describes how Renold arrived at the figure of £8.7m for the year's depreciation, a figure that is apparently similar to that calculated under the Historic Cost Convention. <fnote>Renold PLC, (2005) Annual Report 2005, page 38 </fnote>This affects the value of the fixed assets, but it also affects operating costs since depreciation needs to added in, in turn affecting profits. Another adjustment made is the estimation of the closing stock value of £47.3m since the true value can not be obtained on the same day as the report is issued. Although it is likely to be quite close to the actual figure there is room for adjustment. <fnote>Renold PLC, (2005) Annual Report 2005, page 39 </fnote><heading>Conclusions</heading>Whilst Renold's accounts (as indicated through analysis of the performance ratios) point towards a struggling company, the current climate within the industry can explain the difficulties Renold continues to face. In this way the report offers a true and fair view of their performance throughout the year. Explanations have been given for changes in accounting standards, and the accounts appear transparent to the reader. <quote>"David Larkam, analyst at Arden Partners, agreed that it was difficult to pass on higher prices, but said Renold had not been as aggressive as some in the sector in its dealings with customers. He argued that the group needed to do more to restructure its cost base."</quote><fnote>Financial Times (London) 02 April 2005, Lisa Urquhart, p4 </fnote>Renold continues to restructure, expand and outsource to cheaper economies. The first half of this financial year has seen Renold fall into the red, and continue to make losses, forcing Renold to restate predicted profits for the end of the year. The acquisition of Sachs Automotive France SAS, and the opening of the plant in Tennessee in 2005 could start to offer returns in the second half of the year. Successful talks regarding expansion into China could potentially add further substantial profits in later years. In addition Renold expect their current strong order book position to provide a good platform for continued orders throughout the year, and by selling the Burton-on-Trent plant, some loss will be recovered. Recently Renold has won a major contract to help renovate Underground stations throughout London. This should continue over many years, offering Renold a reliable volume of work. The recommendation from this report for shareholders is to hold with their current level of investment, and they should start getting return towards the end of the year, where increased investment may require further consideration.
