<heading>Introduction: </heading>The aim of these experiments was to determine the thermal conductivity of glass (experiment A), and in oil (experiment B). <heading>Experiment A: Determination of the thermal conductivity of glass (k)</heading><heading>Objectives of experiment A</heading>In experiment A two different equations for k were used. The results for the first equation were compared to the second equation (the second calculation gave an approximation of the value of k). An objective of the experiment was to conclude whether the second equation was a viable approximation to use. To compare the calculated results to the given values of k in a text book. And conclude whether the calculated results were comparable to the given text book values of k. <heading>Procedure: Experiment A: </heading>A glass apparatus was used which consisted of a glass tube through which heat was transferred by condensing steam to a stream of cold water for 60 seconds. The rate of water flow passed via a constant head device so that it could be controlled at a constant value. The value was varied 3 times, to give an appreciable temperature difference between T1 and T2. Two measurements for each flow rate were recorded and an average flow rate was calculated (See table 1). <table/><heading>Calculations</heading><heading> Determination of the thermal conductivity of glass (k) for first flow rate</heading> FORMULA  Therefore  FORMULA  The thermal conductivity of glass = k  FORMULA  Therefore  FORMULA  Therefore  FORMULA  Therefore  FORMULA  <heading>Calculations for the second flow rate of 1.21467 x 10‾³</heading> FORMULA  Therefore H for second flow rate  FORMULA  K can be found by  FORMULA  <heading>Calculations for the third flow rate of 3.9084 x 10‾³</heading> FORMULA  Therefore H for the third flow rate  FORMULA  <heading>Results table of the thermal conductivity of glass (k)</heading><table/>For thin walled tubes the heat transfer rate through the wall approximates to:  FORMULA  Therefore  FORMULA  So  FORMULA  Therefore k using the equation 3  FORMULA  <heading>Conclusion</heading>The given values for the thermal conductivity of glass are 0.1-1.0 W m‾¹ K‾¹. Hence this value can be compared to the equated values of k in this experiment and it can be seen that they fall into the correct parameters. By comparing the results from equations 1 and 2, to the result from equation 3 (see table 3 below) <table/>From the results collected it can be confirmed that the approximation is a reasonable one to make in this case. <heading>Experiment B: determination of the specific heat capacity of a liquid by method of cooling. </heading><heading>Objectives: </heading>A calorimeter was used to collect cooling values of water and oil.(see table 2) These values were then used to produce cooling curves.(see graph 1) From these cooling curves the rates of cooling gradients were determined. Using Newtons law of cooling which states that the rate of loss of heat from a body is directly proportional to the excess temperature of the body above that of its surroundings. The value of the specific heat capacity C of the oil could be calculated. <heading>Calculations of the rates of cooling</heading>Using the information from graph 1 the cooling curve for water and oil determined from the same temperature of 65 ºC can be calculated For oil (dθ/dt)2  FORMULA  Therefore  FORMULA  For water (dθ/dt)1  FORMULA  Therefore  FORMULA  The specific heat capacity C can be calculated by the equation  FORMULA  So  FORMULA  Using the information from graph 1 the cooling curve for water and oil determined from the same temperature of 60 ºC can be calculated For oil (dθ/dt)2  FORMULA  Therefore  FORMULA  For water (dθ/dt)1  FORMULA  Therefore  FORMULA  The specific heat capacity C can be calculated by the equation  FORMULA  So  FORMULA  <heading>Conclusion</heading>From the graphical data: At 65 ºC the ratio of (dθ/dt)1 to (dθ/dt)2 is 8.63 x 10 ‾³ºC/s to 21.875 x 10 ‾³ºC/s or 1: 2.5 At 60 ºC the ratio of (dθ/dt)1 to (dθ/dt)2 is 0.010 ºC/s to 0.015ºC/s or 1: 1.5 The ratio of the rates of cooling is not the same implying some error in the method or data collection. The calculated specific heat capacity of the oil is exactly twice the value calculated for 65 ºC at 60 ºC again implying errors have occurred. <table/>
