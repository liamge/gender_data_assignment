<heading>Stage One:</heading><heading>Aim:- </heading>the aim of stage one is to prepare a sample of acetanilide which can later be brominated. The reason for this is that aniline is too reactive to produce p-bromoaniline directly and so we must first reduce the activating influence of the amino group by acetylation. <table/><figure/><heading>Procedure:- </heading>Aniline (10ml, 109.9mmol) was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (25ml, 437.1mmol) and acetic anhydride (12ml, 127.3mmol) added slowly with swirling. The reaction was exothermic and yielded an orange-brown solution which was allowed to stand for five minutes then diluted with water (approximately 200ml) until crystallization occurred and a dense cream suspension formed. The precipitate was filtered, washed with water and allowed to dry. The filtrate was then re-crystallised from the minimum hot ethanol. <heading>Results: - </heading>Our re-crystallised product was a white solid. It was found to have a melting point in the range of 110 - 114 o c, slightly lower than the literature value for acetanilide of 113 - 115 o c (taken from the Fisher Scientific Catalogue of fine chemicals '05 - '06) but clearly the correct product was formed, ready to be brominated in stage two. 4.78g of product was obtained, equating to 35.4mmol out of a possible 109.9 (this was the number of moles or our limiting reagent, aniline and the reaction occurred with a 1:1 ratio). The percentage yield was calculated as only 32%, which is very low due possibly to loss in the re-crystallization process in which some of our product may have remained soluble in the filtration stage. <heading>Stage Two:</heading><heading>Aim: - </heading>to brominates carbon four of the benzene ring of acetanilide to form p-bromoacetanilide. <table/><figure/><heading>Procedure:- </heading>Acetanilide (4.78g, 35.4 mmol) was dissolved in cold, glacial acetic acid (25ml, 437.1 mmol) and added to it slowly was a solution of bromine (2.1ml, 40.7mmol) and glacial acetic acid (30ml, 524.5mmol) with constant shaking. An orange brown solution formed whose intensity and density increased, over the 15 minutes it was left to stand, to a bright orange suspension which was filtered after the addition of cold water (200ml). The filtrate was stirred with a further portion of water (150ml) containing sodium metabisulfate (2.02g, 9.8mmol) and re filtered, yielding a pale yellow solid, which was then re-crystallized from hot ethanol and a little water (~2ml). This was allowed to cool, then filtered and dried in a desiccator over several days. <heading>Results: - </heading>Our re crystallized product was a white solid, weighing 4.39g. It was found to have a melting point in the range of 167 - 170 oc which confirmed it's identity as p-bromoacetanilide, whose melting point is quoted as 166 - 170 oc. 20.5 mmol of this were obtained out of a possible 35.4mmol, which is how much acetanilide we began with, generating a yield of 57.9% for this stage. <heading>Stage Three :</heading><heading>Aim: - </heading>to remove the protecting acetyl substituent of the p-bromoacetanilide to form our final product, p-bromoaniline. <table/><figure/><heading>Procedure :- </heading>p-bromoacetanilide (4.39g, 20.5mmol), water (25ml) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (25ml, 288mmol) were heated under reflux until the solid dissolved and then for a further 10 minutes. The solution was then cooled in ice water, generating a cloudy white suspension which thickened on addition of 25% sodium hydroxide (added until pH read above 14). A white solution settled above a brown precipitate which was then filtered to reveal two products of differing nature: one a white powder, one a pink - brown solid. Both were dissolved in the minimum hot ethanol and water added drop wise until it became slightly turbid. The solution was then allowed to crystallise, filtered and the filtrate dried in a dessicator over several days, yielding a beige powdery solid. <heading>Results :- </heading>Our re crystallised product was a beige solid of mass 2.15g. It had a melting point of 54 - 61 oc , just slightly under the literature value for p-bromoaniline of 56 - 62 oc but we were satisfied that the correct product had been obtained. The yield for this final stage was 61% and the overall yield (comparing the number of moles of product obtained with those of our starting material) was 11.4%. <heading>Conclusion: - </heading>The overall percentage yield for this experiment is extremely low but unsurprising due to the many processes we undertook where loss of product was unwanted but expected. To improve the loss at re crystallisation a different solvent could be used which would be more specific to our products.
