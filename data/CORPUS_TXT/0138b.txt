On September 18 th 2005, in the wake of a heated political race, German citizens voted to elect their Chancellor. For weeks leading up to the elections, the rivalry between leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Angela Merkel and the existing Social Democrat (SPD) Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, received immense media coverage. Despite the fact that the outcome of these elections could have "radically alter[ed] the face of Europe", however, the European media outside Germany seems to have communicated the two parties' race to the overseas EU public in a largely inaccurate manner. By comparing press treatment of the pre-election period to the examination that might be carried out by a political analyst, one realizes that our media may need to make significant improvements in its coverage of political issues. <fnote>Horsley, William, "What German Poll Means for Europe". BBC News. Internet. 08 / 09 / 2005. Accessed on 05 / 10 / 2005. Accessed at:  URL  </fnote>Throughout the German campaign, one of the focal points of European newspapers has been to contrast the CDU and SPD candidates on a personal basis. In certain publications, such as the Spanish 'El mundo', this comparison is limited to describing Schroeder as "combative", by juxtaposition to a Merkel "with tears in her eyes" at one of her rallies. However, 'The Guardian' goes further, labeling Merkel as "dull [and] uninspiring" and depicting her rival as "the charming and roguish Schroeder". Similarly, the BBC claims that one of Merkel's key challenges will be, "struggl[ing] to match the famous charisma of Mr Schroeder". In a further attempt to spark readers' interest, England's 'Expatica' bases articles wholly on an exchange of venomous words between the candidates during a television debate. This narrow focus on the two politicians' personalities, while helping journalists to better interest and manipulate a politically unaware audience, poorly informs readers; nevertheless, it dominates pre-election articles in major European publications. <fnote>EFE, "Un combativo Gerhard Schröder y una convencida Angela Merkel cierran sus campañas en Alemania".

Accessed at:  URL  </fnote>From a political analyst's perspective, this style of coverage does have some validity: if one accepts the individual level of analysis, whereby individuals are key political actors in international relations, the personality of a leader may be seen to have some bearing on his or her decision-making. Indeed, the processual assumption states that politics exist in all spheres of life and may often occur on a personal basis. Trying to target the EU public by appealing to readers' psychology also illustrates a voluntarist approach to political thought: individuals are more than self-interested rational actors, and they have volition to take decisions based on factors other than a straightforward ordering of preferences. Despite this theoretical backing, however, the individual level of analysis is rather restricted. In order to arrive at a more conclusive study, a political analyst may seek to broaden the scope of his or her investigation. <fnote>Axford, Barrie; Browning, Gary K.; Huggins, Richard; and Rosamond, Ben, "Chapter 1: Individuals: is Politics Really about People?".

Particularly, the Spanish press concentrates on how the SPD plans to rally the support of different interest groups. Schroeder's party satisfies the working class by guaranteeing that the German economy will "continue being productive without destroying . . . workers' rights"; it appeals to ecologists with the argument that economic development will not sacrifice ecological sensitivity, and finally vows to "peacefully resolve world conflicts", thus gaining the backing of pacifists as well. Similarly, the UK's 'Expatica' writes that the SPD's economic plans are, "beloved by unions and hated by most business leaders". In France, 'Nord Eclair' examines how the election of Merkel as Germany's first female Chancellor would impact female voters. By evaluating each party's assets and shortcomings in the eyes of Germany's interest groups, these publications prove slightly more informative for the non-German European reader. <fnote>EFE, "Un combativo Gerhard Schröder y una convencida Angela Merkel cierran sus campañas en Alemania".

Accessed on 14 / 10 / 2005. Accessed at:  URL  </fnote>Certain newspapers widen the domestic level of analysis by comparing the CDU and SPD in terms of domestic German policy. Thus, both 'The Guardian' (UK) and 'El mundo' (Spain) give an overview of Schroeder's plans to cut down on unemployment benefits, and outline Merkel's goal of a "complete political change". Readers learn that, while the SPD would ensure free university education and raise the top rate of tax, for example, the CDU instead proposes to "increase VAT from 16 to 18 per cent" and to introduce tuition fees for students. In France, 'Le Nouvel Observateur' calls attention to the "tactical uncertainty" of Merkel's aims, which it sees as too vague. While carried out by a restricted sample of publications, the investigation of domestic policy proves to be a conclusive and empirical manner of contrasting the two rival parties. Indeed, a somewhat similar evaluation may be gleaned from considering the political expert's viewpoint. <fnote>The Observer, "Germans buy Merkel's miracle". Internet. 04 / 09 / 2005.

Accessed on 14 / 10 / 2005. Accessed at:  URL  </fnote>As with the individual level of analysis, the domestic scrutiny of the CDU and SPD is rooted in political theory. By considering the formal institutions and ideologies that Merkel and Schroeder represent, the media could be seen to consider the two candidates from an arena approach. This coverage is additionally consistent with institutional analysis, which focuses on the rules, norms and values shaping political exchanges; such norms determine what economic or political reforms CDU or SPD leaders can envisage. Thus, to understand why Merkel's feminist arguments have an influential impact on female voters, one must be aware that, in Germany, "the traditional image of the woman entirely committed to her "three K's" (Kinder, children, Kirche, church, and Küche, cooking) has lost its popularity". Some of the CDU's shortcomings can also be explained through the lens of culture and institutions. If Merkel has lost some support through "seeking an "elbow society" driven by egoism", this can be attributed to German socialist past: citizens are firmly embedded in cultural structures of their society (communitarianism), and are reluctant to see their collectivist values change. By contrast, an analyst concerned with the scientific aspect of politics may consider the importance of interest groups and economic reforms in the Merkel and Schroeder campaigns to be evidence of Rational Choice Theory; individuals make political decisions such as voting based on an empirical cost-benefit analysis, by simply selecting the party most likely to satisfy the needs of one's own interest group. In this way, the press's occasional presentation of a domestic level of analysis can be seen to lead to a more comprehensive discussion of the CDU and SPD campaigns. <fnote>Clauwaert, Jules, "Nord Eclair", "Revue de presse: les elections allemandes".

Such is the case of the BBC's William Horsley, who considers the effect that the election outcomes may have at a global level. He explains that a CDU win could forge a "three-way understanding among Berlin, Paris and London", which might be able to resolve European problems such as the breakdown of the EU constitution; furthermore, the impact of a possible friendship between Germany and the United States under Merkel's leadership is explored. In France, 'L'Humanite' adopts an equally wide span by speculating on the fate of European socialism as a result of the elections, just as 'Liberation'(France) analyses the German situation by drawing parallels to the current relationship between French socialist and conservative parties. Given that, "in the EU, the behaviour of Europe's "Big Three" - Germany, France and Britain - is often decisive", it is such far-ranging evaluation that proves of most direct import to non-German European readers. <fnote>Horsley, William, "What German Poll Means for Europe".

The Marxist and Interpretive approaches, for example, both argue that human behaviour is guided by underlying structures that repeat over the ages, but that are unobservable from empirical evidence - one must take a necessary distance from events in order to comprehend their workings. Similarly, if they are to convey the wider implications of the CDU-SPD election outcomes to readers, European newspapers cannot restrict their study to individual or domestic levels. A broader investigation generates not just descriptive knowledge applicable at a single point in time, but also theoretical knowledge that can help to identify global trends in politics. Unfortunately, only a minority of newspapers considers the German elections from such an ample perspective.  <fnote>Axford, Barrie; Browning, Gary K.; Huggins, Richard; and Rosamond, Ben, "Chapter 1: Individuals: is Politics Really about People?". Politics: An Introduction. 2 nd edition, Routledge, 2002. Leftwitch, Adrian, "Thinking Politically: On the Politics of Politics". What is Politics? . 2 nd edition, 2004. </fnote>In conclusion, while the September 18 th elections generated extensive attention from European media outside Germany, the coverage of this issue leaves much to be desired. Due to the narrowness of political analysis undertaken by the majority of pre-election newspapers consulted, the average European citizen received little access to concrete information regarding the importance of the CDU-SPD power struggle. Yet political theory suggests a solution to this dilemma: by moving away from a restrictive level of analysis and into a more global realm, the media may soon offer readers a more enriching understanding of contemporary political issues.
