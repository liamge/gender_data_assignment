<abstract><heading>Abstract: </heading>C. elegans is a very good model organism for developmental biology: it is small, cheap and easy to manipulate. It is extensively used for the understanding of maternal effect genes. These are genes from the mother which are inherited by the embryos and which are essential for the correct and complete development of the embryo. In C. elegans, there are 3 major developmental pathways studied: the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis, the specification of the germline and the dorsal-ventral formation. The anterior- posterior axis is set up through maternal and paternal contribution. The position of the sperm after entry into the egg specifies the posterior pole. Maternal material consists of PAR proteins which are localized at different poles through the action of centrosomes brought by the sperm. These proteins are required for maintenance of the asymmetry along with the CDC-42 G-protein. An array of other proteins such as RIC-8, LET-99, LIN-5 and others are also involved in a-p axis formation. Once the egg is fertilized in undergoes a series of divisions that give rise to somatic blastomeres and germline blastomeres. Specification of the germline involves the maternal genes pie-1 and the mex-1. pie-1 encodes a protein that has dual functionality: it blocks mRNA translation in germline blastomeres and induces maternal programs involved in germ cell development. Finally, the dorsal-ventral formation relies on the somatic blastomeres, in particular ABa, ABp and EMS. ABa generates the anterior pharyngeal cells through cell-cell interaction with EMS, also involving the receptor GLP-1 and an unknown ligand. EMS forms the posterior pharyngeal cells autonomously and with the help of the skn-1 gene which is distributed unequally. Finally ABp forms the rectal and valve cells through interaction between its receptor GLP-1 as well, and the ligand APX-1 signalled from P 2. All these genes have homologies with other species including human, and although most of them form a complex interactive network, their analysis is vital for understanding human development. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>The success of molecular biology is due to the existence of model systems. These are defined as extremely simple organism such as Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Caenorhabditis elegans. The latter was introduced as model system by Dr. Sydney Brenner in 1974 (Gilbert, 2003). This free living, non-parasitic soil nematode has all the characteristics of the ideal model organism: it is small, easy to manipulate, cheap, has a short life cycle and most importantly its genome (which is approximately 100 Mbp, that is to say 20 times bigger than that of E. coli and about 1/30 of that of the human) shows 40% homology to that of the human (Gilbert, 2003). Figure 1 shows 3 nematode worms viewed under the microscope. <picture/>Moreover, this multicellular organism is a hermaphrodite. It is also transparent making the tracking of cells and following of cell lineages (which is most of the time invariant) very easy using reporter genes such as GFP (green fluorescent protein) (Gilbert, 2003). Its genome also makes it easy to mutate it: various mutagens can be used, such as EMS, to define mutants. Mutants can also be obtained using reverse genetics particularly RNA interference (RNAi) which consists of transcribing RNA in vitro from a specific target gene and injecting it into the gonad of wild type worms. It then prevents the production of the protein product of the target gene (Rose and Kemphues, 1998). The latter has been extensively used to study maternally expressed genes. Maternal effect genes are genes required for the development of the embryo. Many of these appear to have a role in the development of the worm and researchers are currently analysing is their exact role. Understanding such an analysis requires the discussion of how the initial asymmetries are set up in the embryo, how the cell fates and lineage are specified. <heading>I) The anterior-posterior (a-p) axis establishment in the nematode worm</heading><heading>Determination of the position of the cell axis</heading>C. elegans embryogenesis begins with the entry of the sperm into the egg, a process called fertilization and resulting into the formation of a zygote P 0. Just before fertilization, the C. elegans oocyte is arrested in meiotic prophase I. The oocyte pronucleus moves away from the side contacting the spermatheca and the nuclear envelope breaks down (Gotta and Ahringer, 2001). It is only then that the sperm enters. Sperm entry triggers 3 events: completion of meiosis with extrusion of 2 polar bodies, formation of a protective eggshell (its rigidity forces the embryo into an ovoid shape) and finally the arrangement of the a-p axis (Lyczak et al., 2002; Gotta and Arhinger, 2001; Rose and Kemphues, 1998). The position of the sperm appears to polarize the zygote (it defines the posterior end and the a-p axis which is the long axis of the egg) bringing along centrosomes. Meanwhile, the embryo undergoes a process known as pseudocleavage (Lyczak et al., 2002; Cowan and Hyman, 2004) (see figure 2 for a detailed schematic diagram of this process). <picture/><figure/>The cytoplasm is reorganised through the internal cytoplasm being moved to the posterior and the cortical cytoplasm in the opposite direction. The mechanism by which the sperm contributes to the establishment of the a-p axis is not fully understood, however, the cues seem to reside in the sperm donated centrosome and associated microtubules, not in the pronucleus (Lyczak et al., 2002; Gotta and Arhinger, 2001). This is further exemplified by the fact that sperm lacking DNA can still fertilize the oocyte and determine the polarity (Gotta and Ahringer, 2001). In addition to this, disruption of microfilaments, cytoplasmic flow and pseudocleavage by dsRNA mediated interference of nmy-2 (non muscle mysosin II heavy chain gene) results in the removal of the a-p axis, showing that an entire acto-myosin cystoskeleton is required (Lyczak et al., 2002). <picture/>Nevertheless, the set up of the a-p axis requires maternal signals as well. <heading>B) Contribution of maternal proteins to the a-p axis formation</heading>Analysis of maternal effect lethal mutations led to the finding of 6 genes: the par genes (par stands for partitioning defective). Table 1 summarizes the different genes. <table/>Their mutation causes early division defects such as equal first cleavage, synchronous second cleavage, mislocalization of P granules and alterations in spindle orientation (see section II to get a full insight and understanding of these events) (Rose and Kemphues, 1998). In the fertilized egg, PAR-1 and PAR-2 are found in the posterior cortex while PAR-3 and PAR-6 are found at the opposite end. The proteins also have an antagonizing effect on each other: the loss of PAR-3, PAR-6 and PKC-3 result in the uniform distribution of PAR-1 and PAR-2. Additionally, the contractile polarity coincides with the domains occupied by the PAR proteins suggesting that the 2 processes are linked. This evidence puts forward the hypothesis that par genes provide polarity information during the first cell cycle. Furthermore, they are required for orientating mitotic spindles during the 2 cell stage (Lyczak and Bowerman, 2002) In summary PAR proteins have emerged as key players in cortical asymmetry and their antagonizing properties may allow for maintenance of these domains resulting in anterior-posterior axis formation. Nonetheless these proteins are also assisted by other proteins. <heading>C) Other proteins involved in the process</heading>As stated above, the PAR proteins do not act by themselves. They are chaperoned and aided by other proteins. These proteins include MEX-3, MEX-1 (discussed in section II), MEX-5 and MEX-6, 2 closely related CCCH finger proteins that seem to act downstream of the PAR proteins in localising asymmetrically proteins but not involved in spindle asymmetry in the zygote (Gotta and Arhinger, 2001). Spindle asymmetry appears to be dictated by LIN-5. So far the most striking and exciting finding concerning spindle asymmetry is the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins. One G protein in particular, CDC-42, is vital in maintaining but not initiating polarity. This was deduced following the observation that embryos, in which CDC-42 had been inhibited by RNAi, closely resembled those that had absent or defective PAR-3, PAR-5, or PKC-3 (Gotta and Arhinger, 2001). Furthermore, two redundant Gα subunits GOA-1 and GPA-16 are required for posterior displacement of the zygote spindle (Gotta and Arhinger, 2001; Lyczak and Bowerman, 2002). In addition to this, Gβγ controls distinct MT-dependent processes and thus is involved in orientating the mitotic spindle. Three other proteins are thought to interact with the G proteins subunits during spindle positioning: RIC-8, LET-99, and SPN-1 (Lyczak and Bowerman, 2002; Gotta and Arhinger, 2001). And finally intracellular trafficking appears to also be important in polarity establishment, involving 2 proteins, OOC-5 and OOC-3 which are found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Table 2 concisely describes the different proteins along with explaining their role, the consequence of their absence or defect on the phenotype. <table/><figure/><heading>II) Cell fates and lineage specification: germline development</heading><heading>A) Embryonic lineage</heading>After a series of event (stated in the first section) the egg divides and gives rise to 2 daughter cells known as AB (anterior blastomere) and P 1 (posterior blastomere). This division precedes and leads to subsequent divisions producing somatic cells (soma) and germline cells (germline). To be more accurate, once the fertilized egg has given rise to AB and P 1, AB divides equally to generate somatic daughters with equivalent developmental potential (Seydoux and Strome, 1999) whereas the P 1 germline blastomere divides unequally generating somatic blastomeres and germline blastomeres. The major end products of the germline cleavage are 2 primordial germ cells, Z 2 and Z 3. Figure 5 provides a clear and concise overview of the embryonic lineage in general and the subsequent cleavages. <figure/>The germ line lineage is fully understood unlike the mechanism which differentiates the germline and the soma. <heading>B) Germline specification and distinction from the soma in C. elegans .</heading>Many characteristics constitute such a difference between germline blastomeres and somatic blastomeres. The germ cells arise from totipotent cells and have a very low mitotic activity compared to somatic cells instead; they undergo meiosis and gametogenesis (Seydoux and Strome, 1999; Mello et al., 1992). However, the distinction between germline and soma is more complex and involves mechanisms that are still to be fully understood. One of the most striking characteristic that discriminates them is the difference in transcriptional activity. An analysis of 16 transcripts revealed the presence of newly synthesized mRNA in somatic blastomeres, but never in the germline blastomeres (Seydoux and Strome, 1999; Seydoux et al. , 1996). These experiments resulted in the proposal of two hypotheses: either there is a block in mRNA synthesis in germline blastomeres or a decrease in its stability. Further experiments supported the first hypothesis. These were conducted by Geraldine Seydoux and Susan Strome and showed that the germline blastomeres lacked a specific phosphoepitope (H5) on the carboxyl terminal (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. Thus its activity is reduced or even absent (Seydoux and Strome, 1999; Tenehaus et al. , 2001). It was later discovered that mRNA inhibition is in fact regulated by pie-1 (Seydoux and Strome, 1999; Tenehaus et al. , 2001; Seydoux et al. , 1996). The pie-1 gene is believed to play an important role in germline specification. The pie-1 gene encodes a 38kDA cytoplasmic and nuclear protein called PIE-1 protein which contains two zinc fingers of the C 3H class (3 cysteines and histidine residues). It appears to be present at the right time and the right place to repress transcription in germline blastomeres. See table 3 for description of observations that led to these conclusions. <table/>It has been concluded that the inhibition of transcription might protect germline blastomeres from the activity of transcription factors that normally promote somatic development (Seydoux et al., 1996; Seydoux and Strome, 1999). A perfect example is SKN-1 which is a transcription factor present in EMS and P 2 but only functions in EMS (refer to section III for a more detailed description of this transcription factor). It specifies the fate of the former and is prevented from acting on the latter by PIE-1 (Seydoux et al., 1996; Seydoux and Strome, 1999). However, SKN-1 is probably not the only transcription factor whose activity is repressed by PIE-1. Nevertheless PIE-1 appears to have another important role in germline lineage along with another protein. <heading>C) Bifunctionality of PIE-1 and regulation by MEX-1. </heading>As stated earlier on, PIE-1 is also present in the cytoplasm of germline cells. In the cytoplasm, it is associated with P granules (Tenehaus et al., 2001). These are germline associated RNA-rich organelles believed to be involved in germ cell development (Guedes and Priess, 1997). In conjunction with its role in the nucleus, PIE-1's cytoplasmic function promotes the expression of factors that are maternally encoded and that are crucial for primordial germ cell development such as the maternally encoded Nanos homolog NOS-2 (Tenenhaus et al. , 2001). The cytoplasm found in germ cells is called germ plasm. In the zygote, by an MT- dependent manner P granules are carried to the posterior end, where they associate with the cortex (Spike and Strome, 2003). This results in most P granules being segregated to P 1 (Spike and Strome, 2003). P granules also turn up to be unstable in the cytoplasm fated for the somatic blastomeres. Experiments by Caroline Spike and Susan Strome described this phenomenon as: "P granules being trapped near the anterior cortex of a P 0 cell appear to be disassembled or degraded prior to cell division and the few P granules mistakenly segregated to a C or D blastomere disappear rapidly" (Spike and Strome, 2003). In addition to this, it has been found that the germ plasm also contains the MEX-1 protein. MEX-1 is very similar to the PIE-1 protein (Guedes and Priess, 1997). MEX-1 is encoded by the mex-1 gene which when mutated causes the embryo to produce too many pharyngeal cells as does the pie-1gene (pie stands for pharyngeal intestinal excess and mex stands for muscle excess) (Mello et al., 1992). It also has the same 2 copies of the unusual finger domain found in the PIE-1 protein (Guedes and Priess, 1997). Although MEX-1 is only present in the cytoplasm, it is a granule component which appears to be required to restrict PIE-1 expression and activity to the germline blastomere (Guedes and Priess, 1997). Figure 6 shows the effect of the absence of the 2 proteins on the germ lineage. <figure/>The specification of the germline therefore involves 2 major proteins, PIE-1 and MEX-1. PIE-1 blocks zygotic programs that drive somatic development and activates maternal programs that drive germ cell development. As for MEX-1 it regulates PIE-1. Figure 7 summarizes the role of the 2 proteins. <figure/><heading>III) Somatic specification: dorsal-ventral formation</heading>The anterior blastomeres produced at the 2 cell stage have the equal developmental potential (referred to briefly in section II). They are eventually committed to different fates: ABa progeny give rise to anterior pharyngeal cells and ABp descendants contribute to the formation of the anus and rectum. <heading>Cell-cell interaction</heading>Specification of ABp fate requires cell-cell interaction between ABp and P 2. This was demonstrated by Shelton and Bowerman (1996) by incubating intact embryos overnight and using antibodies to distinguish the cell types normally generated by ABp. In addition, when AB and P 2 are grown in isolation, they do not produce valve nor rectal cells. It follows that ABp-P2 interaction engages the maternal effect gene glp-1. This gene encodes the protein GLP-1, which is a membrane bound receptor and a homolog of the Drosophila Notch (Shelton and Bowerman, 1996; Evans et al., 1994; Mickey et al., 1996). P 2 seems to be the signalling cell, with the ligand being APX-1, a homolog of the Drosophila Delta (Mickey et al., 1996; Shelton and Bowerman, 1996). Two line s of evidence suggest this: in apx-1 embryos (produced from apx-1 mutant mothers), ABp produces pharyngeal cells (cells produced by ABa) and its sequence is very similar to that of Drosophila Delta (Shelton and Bowerman, 1996). At the 2 cell stage, APX-1 is found in the anterior of the P 1 blastomere. Moreover, it is localized in a very similar manner to that of PAR-3. It follows that the level of APX-1 increases in P 2 although the mRNA is present in all the 4 cell stage blastomeres. These observations have led to the conclusion that it must be translationally regulated, membrane targeted or stabilised/destabilised. In other words, its localization could result from the same mechanism as PAR-3 or interaction with adjacent blastomeres (Mickey  et al., 1996). Figure 8 shows a model of this localization. <figure/>GLP-1 appears to be the receptor in ABa induction; however, its ligand isn't APX-1: apx-1 mutant blastomeres are still able to give rise to pharyngeal cells when induced by the appropriate cell (Shelton and Bowerman, 1996). However, the ligand has yet to be identified. EMS and its descendants are the signalling cells: removal of EMS by laser ablation greatly affects ABa descendants which failed to produce their cells (Mello et al., 1994). The question is: how can the same receptor send out 2 developmental signals with very different consequences? 2 models have been proposed: developmental fate either depends on the activated cell or on temporal changes in the cellular factors expressed by the responding cell. The latter has been validated as the switching of one blastomere for the other does not change the inductive response (Shelton and Bowerman, 1996). Even though glp-1 is present in all blastomeres up to the 8 cell stage, its translation is temporally and spatially regulated. A study using a reporter RNA has revealed that this regulation is controlled by the 3' untranslated region of the gene (3'UTR) (Ogura et al., 2003). Two regulatory regions have been revealed: a 61 nucleotide region in the middle known as spatial control region which represses translation in the descendants of P 1 and a 125 nucleotide region initially identified as the temporal control region. However it has recently been revealed that it also contains a spatial activation region (Ogura et al., 2003; Evans et al., 1994). See figure 9 for a schematic diagram of this region of the gene. <figure/>The presence of 2 regulatory regions indicates that glp-1 mRNA is regulated by 2 factors: POS-1 which binds to SCR and temporal regulation which is achieved by the binding of SPN-4 (has an RNA type binding domain) to the TCR which is then inactivated between the 2 and 4 cell stages (Ogura et al., 2003; Evans et al. , 1994). Figure 10 represents a schematic diagram which describes the regulation. <figure/><heading>Autonomous development</heading>EMS also gives rise to pharyngeal cells although they are posterior (Bowerman et al. , 1992). Two lines of evidence suggest that generation of pharyngeals cells by EMS is through autonomous cell specification (in other words it adopts its normal pattern of development without requiring cell-cell interaction): destruction of ABa blastomeres by laser ablation does not affect the production of cell by EMS and neither does the production of glp-1 embryos (Bowerman et al., 1992). A genetic analysis has revealed that EMS development requires the maternal gene skn-1 which stands for s ki n in excess (maternal because skn-1 embryos fail to be rescued by wild type male sperm and lack pharyngeal and intestinal cells) (Bowerman et al., 1992; Rose and Kemphues, 1998). Figure 11 shows the differences between wild-type and skn-1 embryos phenotype. <figure/>skn-1 encodes a transcription factor that contains a basic region similar to those of basic leucine zipper proteins (bZIP). Additionally it binds as a monomer because it lacks a leucine zipper dimerization domain. This paradox has been resolved by Blackwell and coworkers in 1994 which explained that "its binding domain represents an alternative strategy for promoting binding of a basic region segment helix to a bZIP half site". So how is SKN-1 localized to EMS in the first place? Following fertilization and the 2 nd division, SKN-1 appears to build up at much higher levels in P 1 than in the AB blastomeres. SKN-1 is therefore localized unequally in the C. elegans embryo. The possible mechanisms by which it amasses are: differences in distribution or translation of the mRNA or differences in the stability of the protein. A series of mutations (maternal effect mutations in par-1 and mex-1 which lead to approximately equal levels of SKN-1 in both P 1 and AB) have led to the conclusion that MEX-1 and PAR-1 are required for the unequal distribution of the SKN-1 to P 1 (Blackwell et al., 1994) . So why do P 2 and EMS have different fates? This question is still under investigation but it looks like pie-1 (+) activity may control the activity of SKN-1 in the EMS and its progeny (Bowerman et al., 1993) and that an interaction between P 2 and EMS is required (Rose and Kemphues, 1998). <heading>Conclusion:</heading>Three different developmental pathways and so many genes! However, they are interconnected forming a complex cross-network. Table 4 summarizes all the genes and proteins involved in the different pathways. <table/><figure/>Could the analysis reveal some aspect of the human development? It seems that understand how this organisms and other invertebrates acquire different potentials could be a further step to understanding embryo development, finding a treatments for prenatal malformations and avoiding miscarriages.
