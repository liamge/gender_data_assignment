<heading>Aims:</heading>To measure experimentally the enthalpy of vapourisation of liquid nitrogen (N 2), and that of solid carbon dioxide (CO 2) in order to test the validity of Trouton's Rule. <heading>Method:</heading>The temperature of 1 dm 3 of water in a Styrofoam igloo was measured until constant. A known amount of the cryogen was added directly and the temperature of the water measured every minute until there was no further temperature change due to the presence of the cryogen. The temperature of the nitrogen and carbon dioxide vapour evolved was measured using a thermocouple. The data obtained, along with the boiling points of nitrogen and carbon dioxide was used to calculate the entropy of vapourisation of both these substances. A weighed mass CO 2 of was used as follows: <list> FORMULA  FORMULA </list>The liquid nitrogen could not be weighed accurately directly, so a cup filled to a mark was used to measure a volume of nitrogen. This volume was equivalent to a mass of water of 110.7 ±1.0g (This large uncertainty is due to the width of the mark). <heading>Results</heading><table/><table/>N.B. 1. * denotes negligible error (2.272 x10 -5 mol) 2. Heat capacities of each substance are found in the lab manual and are taken to have zero uncertainty. 3. The thermocouple reading of gaseous temperature is taken to have an uncertainty of ± 0.5K. 4. The boiling points of N 2 and CO 2 were taken as 77.0 ± 0.5 K and 194.5 ± 0.5K respectively. 5. The value of enthalpy of fusion of CO 2 which needs to be taken into account to work out the enthalpy of vapourisation was taken as 7.94 kJ mol -1, with zero uncertainty. <heading>Graphs used to calculate ∆T</heading><figure/><figure/><figure/><figure/><heading>Conclusions</heading>The entropy of vapourisation of carbon dioxide was found to be, on average, 77.87 ± 7.11 JK -1mol -1, and that of nitrogen to be 77.66 ± 6.04 JK -1mol -1. These values are in agreement with Trouton's rule that states the entropy of vapourisation of most substances is approximately equal to 85 JK -1mol -1 . The apparatus used in the experiment is simpler than that which would be desirable to obtain fully accurate data. However, the uncertainties calculated show that the results were sufficiently accurate to agree with Trouton's rule. The major sources of uncertainty were the measurement of the volume of water used and the estimation of the temperature change, which at best could only be made to the nearest half-degree. An accurate thermocouple measurement of the liquid would have been more desirable. The temperature of the gaseous cryogen should have been measured for each experiment, as the amount of cryogen used in each was significantly different (especially for CO 2) to give a large difference in the amount of energy taken out of the water, and hence seriously affect the overall result.
