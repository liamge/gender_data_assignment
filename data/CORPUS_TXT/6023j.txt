<heading>OBJECTIVE</heading>The aim of the practical was to illustrate and see practical application and importance of various packaging materials. The effectiveness of different materials and methods was considered using various food materials under different conditions <heading>INTRODUCTION </heading><quote>" In today's society , packaging is pervasive and essential. It surrounds, enhances and protects goods we buy , from processing and manufacturing , through=gh handling and storage to the final consumer"</quote><fnote>Robertson , Gordon L (1993) Food Packaging Principles and practice </fnote>Packaging plays a vital role in maintaining foods in a healthy or fit state for eventual consumption. Packaging reduces infestation, spoilage, water uptake or loss, contamination and oxidation. The packaging materials available are as variable and complex as the nature of foods available Furthermore , on average around 25% of the ex-factory cost of consumer foods is for their packaging <fnote>Robertson , Gordon L (1993) Food Packaging Principles and practice </fnote>Packaging comes into play in the processing, preservation, marketing and distribution of many foods <heading>PROCEDURE</heading>The Packaging and storage of the following foods was considered <heading>Fresh fruit: Grapes</heading>Packaged using regenerated cellulose 350M.S with the following variations One sample was heat sealed The second sample had 2X5mm diameter holes punched through the cellulose and heat sealed The third sample had 8X5mm diameter holes punched through the cellulose before heat sealing The grapes were also packaged in 150 gauge polyethylene and heat sealed and the final sample was stored in an open container. <heading>Fresh meat: Beef steak</heading>Placed on baseboards and over wrapped using regenerated cellulose 345QMS, regenerated cellulose 350MSand 340 D.M.S. Each of these was heat sealed using a flat sealer. The final sample was stored in an open container <heading>Cheese </heading>The seven cheese samples were packaged as follows <list>Packaged in Regenerated cellulose 350 M.S and heat sealedVacuum packed in regenerated cellulose and heat sealedVacuum packed in 150gauge polyethylene and heat sealed : This vacuum package was then vacuum packaged in an outer package of regenerated cellulose 350MS Also packed in Cryovac S film and heat sealed using an impulse sealer Vacuum packed in Cryovac S film and specially sealed using a multivac sealer and shrinking the film with a hot air gun .Wrapped in aluminium foil Placed on a tray that was left out in the open </list><heading>Potatoes</heading>All the samples were packaged using details of packaging procedure which can be found in the practical handout All samples were packaged in 150 gauge polyethylene and placed in varying conditions <list>At room temperature in daylightAt room temperature in a dark boxAt 4°C in a cold room </list>Secondly as a variation the potatoes were packaged in 150 gauge polyethylene with 4X5mm holes and the three samples were place in the same conditions listed above <heading>Chocolate</heading>Permeability to odours and flavours was also considered A sample of chocolate was divided into 5 equal portions and packaged in packaging materials under test as described in the hand out. Observations were made after 7 days to rank the samples in order of freedom form <list>Contaminant odour Contaminant flavour</list><heading>RESULTS & DISCUSSION</heading><heading>GRAPES</heading><table/><table/><heading>Discussion</heading>Polyethylene was the most suitable material for packaging of fresh fruit because the samples not only had the lowest moisture loss figures (0.07g /day) but did not develop mould . After 10 days they were over-ripe but otherwise well preserved Regenerated cellulose was the second most effective in preventing moisture loss. The greater the number of hole s in the packaging the higher the moisture loss . Mould appeared to develop faster in the regenerated cellulose 350MS that had holes . But the more holes there were the less the occurrence of mould . Correspondingly the grapes in the packages with holes also became over-ripe faster and did not remain as plump and firm as those grapes in packages without holes The open samples , as expected, had the highest moisture loss and thus became shrivelled in appearance . They did not develop any mould <heading>Conclusions </heading>-It is best to package fresh fruit like grapes in materials that do not have holes so as to minimise moisture loss and thus maintain fruits plump appearance. -The prescence of a steady stream of fresh air may retard the development of mould (see open packaging and cellulose 350MS with 8 holes) and prevents quick ripening . -Having and insufficient number of air openings may on the other hand aid the development of mould and the fruits may become brown faster . <heading>CHEESE</heading><table/><heading>Discussion</heading>NB all samples were stored at ambient temperature which is not the state they would ordinarily be stored in <list><heading>The key factors considered in packaging of cheese are the </heading>water activity of the surface (which is affected by the water vapour permeability of the packaging material)The effect of light (this initiates the oxidation of fats giving rise to off-flavours) The effect of oxygen </list>Vacuum packing cheese in Cryovac S was the best method of packaging cheese in as far as maintaining moisture and preventing the development of mould This sample did not experience any moisture loss. Packaging the cheese by heat sealing in Regenerated cellulose 350MS and 150 gauge polyethylene had the similar results ; a mouldy cheese with oils permeating out and a bad smell .An unsatisfactory result The cheese left out in the open had the highest moisture loss (0.395g a day ) and became very hard with a lot of the oils permeating out of the sample The cheese wrapped in aluminium foil lost the second largest amount of moisture , developed mould and a hard texture . *The most suitable method for packaging cheese was vacuum packing it in Regenerated cellulose 350 MS . This lost a fair amount of moisture and had some oils permeating out after 10 days but was otherwise well preserved . <heading>Conclusion </heading>As aforementioned the exclusion of air is an important factor to consider when packaging cheese . Gas or vacuum packaged cheese has a water vapour transmission rate of approximately 4.0 g/m 2 a day at 25°C/75% RH as compared with 30g/m 2 for consumer packaged cheese hence the acuum packed cellulose 350MS gave the best result. <heading>FRESH MEAT</heading><table/><heading>Discussion</heading>The water activity of chilled meat is very high , hence unprotected meat normally loses a lot of moisture to the environment by evaporation . This causes its appearance to deteriorate. Meat which has been cut exudes a lot more liquid from its exposed surfaces The meat packaged in the regenerate cellulose 345 Q.M .S was the most well preserved . It remained moist and had deteriorated considerably less than the other samples after 10 days .This sample had the second lowest moisture loss rate (0.24g a day ) and maintained its bright red colour the longest The meat left unwrapped was the least well preserved . It lost 20.17% of its weight in moisture (16.1g) ,and had an extremely poor appearance . The regenerated cellulose 350M.S retained a good deal of its succulence but deteriorated the most rapidly . The regenerated cellulose 340 M.S was the lost nearly half as much moisture as the sample left un wrapped and its colour deteriorated as well <heading>Conclusion </heading>Consumers consider bright red coloured meat as good quality so packaging such as 345 Q.M.S which maintains this is favourable. The bright red colour is as a result of the principal pigment myoglobin which exists in varying concentration and chemical forms in the meat . <heading>POTATO</heading><table/><table/><heading>Discussion </heading>The potatoes stored in packaging with holes had higher moisture losses with losses being less when stored in a cold room. This is probably due to the reduced energy and access for evaporation of water from the surface . Potatoes stored in the dark at ambient temperature had the best quality overall. Storage in the cold resulted in dark patches and a damp smell, Potatoes stored in the light sprouted and a few turned green <heading>Conclusion </heading>Potatoes are best stored at ambient temperature in the dark with a restricted amount of air flow . This will ensure they do not sprout for a longer period of time and maintain moisture . <heading>Chocolate</heading><table/><heading>Discussion</heading>The packaging materials permeability to odours and flavours can be ranked as follows <list>Uncovered Polypropylene Polyethylene PVDC Cellulose 350MS </list><heading>Permeability to odour and flavour decreasing </heading>Cellulose 350Ms can thus be concluded to be the most suitable packaging material as it is effective in keeping out unwanted strong flavours and odours that may taint the flavour and odour of packaged food . In conclusion the packaging of any food material is inherently dependant on the nature of the food, the conditions and times of its distribution from farm to factory and to plate (i.e. the required shelf life) Decisions as to the suitability of any packaging material must be made only after a careful and comprehensive appreciation of all the options available
