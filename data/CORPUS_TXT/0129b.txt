Following his inauguration as President of the United States, on 4 March 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt commenced with putting his New Deal policy into effect. This unique programme of legislation was formulated in response to the Great Depression, during which the nation had plummeted into a situation of inconceivable destitution and despair, as a catastrophic repercussion of the Wall Street Crash on 29 October 1929. The evaluation of the New Deal, in retrospect, raises questions not only of its short-term success, regarding whether it achieved its ultimate objective of lifting the country out of depression, but also of its long-term impact on the United States. This evaluation is synonymous with the debate on whether the New Deal was 'revolutionary or evolutionary', echoing historical notions of continuity and change, in which American historians and political scientists, notably Chalmers Johnson, have played down its revolutionary characteristics. <fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.62 </fnote><fnote>Chalmers Johnson, Revolutionary Change (London, 1968) </fnote>It is essential to consider the provenance of studies on the success of the New Deal, specifically including the personal background of historians. For instance, historians who endured the Great Depression, and thus directly experienced the effects of the New Deal, may be 'tinged with a pinch of compassion' when surmising its level of success, however, 'as time passes, historians feel a little less personally involved with the New Deal and less defensive about it' and thus may be readily critical of its achievements. <fnote>Paul Conkin, The New Deal (London, 1968), p.105 </fnote><fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.71 </fnote>Interpretations of the New Deal, and its success, diverge between right and left wing classifications, the latter continuing to dominate its historiography. Left wing historians, such as Barton Bernstein and Paul Conkin, believe the New Deal was unable to wholly depart from liberal reformist ideals and therefore incapable of completely reviving the collapsed economy. More positively, centre-left historians, for example William Leuchtenburg, observe the New Deal as being a fundamental reform and enduring success of the political system. At the other end of the historiographical spectrum, those from the right wing school, including Robert Higgs, attack the New Deal as being an ultimate betrayal of traditional liberal values of laissez-faire, thus allowing elements of Communism to burgeon in the United States. Within this range of interpretations there is not an absolute denial that the New Deal was successful to a certain extent in its preliminary achievements, however there exist discrepancies concerning the degree of its long-term impact. <fnote>Bernstein, Barton, Towards a New Past: Dissenting Essays in American History (New York, 1968) </fnote><fnote>Paul Conkin, The New Deal (London, 1968) </fnote><fnote>William Leuchtenburg, Franklin D.

Crisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government (New York, 1987) </fnote>The Great Depression signified an unforeseen departure from the earlier prosperity of the decade and left the United States in a state of emergency. The explicit purpose of the New Deal was as a response to this situation, thus its success should be measured according to the extent to which it brought the country out of depression and stimulated the economy, by presenting an overview of its chief policies. The epoch of the New Deal is divided into two distinctive phases, the First and Second, in accordance with the objective of its policies; namely relief, recovery and reform. The First New Deal, spanning the period 1933 to 1935, specifically focused upon relief and recovery: 'the tremendous emergency of the depression had produced an insistence that government undertake the tasks of unemployment relief and economic recovery." In the whirlwind of the first 'Hundred Days' Roosevelt created a plethora of 'Alphabet Agencies', employing the fiscal tool of deficit spending. <fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.74 </fnote><fnote>Dennis Brogan, Roosevelt and the New Deal (London, 1952), p.35 </fnote>Early relief campaigns to provide shelter and food were combined with policies of recovery, commencing with the Emergency Banking Act (Glass-Steagall Act) in March 1933. This succeeded in restoring the nation's confidence in the financial system by proving the solvency of banks and ensuring the security of money deposited in them, persuading people to utilise them again. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) became law, in 1933, with the intention of remedying the dire situation of unemployment and industrial disorganisation, and has been labelled 'the governments most elaborate scheme to revive industry." Its success depended on the supplementary agencies that it established for designated purposes: the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), the Public Works Administration (PWA) and the National Recovery Administration (NRA). These were key components of the New Deal and 'welding these different elements together was a triumph', implying their combined involvement in its success. <fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.46 </fnote><fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.61 </fnote>The New Deals agricultural programme, commanded by the AAA, benefited farmers by limiting production within the existing system, which marginally increased their income. However, its success is lessened because it diminished farmers' entrepreneurial independence, and it did not have an immense effect on the economy as a whole. The Resettlement Administration, of 1935, subsequently proposed increasing production under a reformed system, representing one of the ironies with which the New Deal was riddled, and exacerbated the constraints of the New Deals success in agriculture. The PWA was the most successful division of the NIRA, formed to pump state funds into construction works schemes, of which there existed over thirty thousand, in the hope of stimulating industry. The PWA was somewhat successful in its attempts to bring the country out of depression, by creating an influx of work for millions of starving people, although it did not equal pre-depression levels of employment. The majority of PWA projects led to the erection of structures that stood as marked successes of the New Deal, for example 'bridges...schools, and hospitals', leaving the State with something to show for its vast expenditure. Furthermore, workers retained their skills, which afforded them increased job opportunities in the future. <fnote>Dennis Brogan, Roosevelt and the New Deal (London, 1952), p.86 </fnote>Although initially considered the keystone of Roosevelt's New Deal programme, the NRA 'became an object of great controversy after the initial flush of enthusiasm', and was declared unconstitutional in May 1935 following the Supreme Court ruling in Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States. The success of the NRA dwindled as a result of its over-zealous attempts to regulate all areas of business, as opposed to concentrating its efforts on major industry. Hence, it did not succeed in its efforts to stimulate demand and arguably brought the United States closer to socialism, by allowing Presidential intervention in commerce. Nevertheless, the social reforms promoted by the NRA, for fixed minimum wages and shorter working hours, must not be undervalued. <fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.47 </fnote>Another successful aspect of the New Deal was the 'most admired' Civilian Conservation Corps, formed in March 1933, which targeted the demoralised youth. The prime focus was upon young male victims of the depression, of whom the CCC had employed 250,000 in their camps by August 1933. The work of these youths in forestry, flood control and fire prevention, highlights the success of the New Deal in both soaking up excessive numbers of unemployed alongside improving the self-esteem of the younger generation. <fnote>Dennis Brogan, Roosevelt and the New Deal (London, 1952), p.35 </fnote><fnote>Dennis Brogan, Roosevelt and the New Deal (London, 1952), p.35 </fnote>The Tennessee Valley Authority, of May 1933, generated work among farmers, in programmes aimed at reactivating regional hydroelectric power via the construction of dams, in addition to controlling flood problems along the Mississippi tributary system. It was 'maybe in the long run its most fruitful innovation', embracing the long-term material benefits of the New Deal. <fnote>Arthur Schlesinger (Jr.), 'The Broad Accomplishments of the New Deal', in, Edwin Rozwenc (ed.), The New Deal: Revolution or Evolution? (Boston, Mass., 1959), p.33 </fnote>The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) was also established in 1933, under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, for managing the provision of direct relief in the form of grants to badly affected states, and was debatably another 'of the most successful parts of the New Deal." Most of the achievements of FERA stemmed from its auxiliary organisation, the Civil Works Administration. The objective of this relief organisation was to provide work for those deemed unemployable by absorbing them into state projects, and it largely succeeded in giving assistance to 'those who had lived on the margins of poverty.'  <fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.41 </fnote><fnote>Alonzo Hamby, The New Deal: Analysis and Interpretation (New York, c.1981), p.5 </fnote>As the decade progressed, and the immediate dilemma of unemployment and destitution had been confronted, the Second New Deal emerged, in 1935. Its continuation was aided by Roosevelt's landslide victory in the 1936 Presidential elections, clearly implying that 'the verdict of the American people on the New Deal at the time was overwhelming approval', and it survived until the advent of World War II in 1939. <fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.62 </fnote>This second phase ventured forward opportunistically with a more radical 'reform conscious' agenda, encompassing the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the Emergency Relief Act, and the Social Security Act. Although the WPA was crucial in generating even more jobs, it is the latter that has been described as 'the most significant symbol of the entire New Deal', implying its success in establishing a scheme of unemployment insurance and old age pensions. The social security system is emblematic of the New Deal as it is still present in the United States today, although now encompasses a greater selection of the population, such as teachers and farm labourers, who were excluded at the outset. <fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.56 </fnote><fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.58 </fnote>Notwithstanding its successes, this second phase was judged as 'vulnerable' in comparison to its precursor. It has also been postulated that it 'represented a false smoke screen...a permanent rejection of real planning' as a result of Roosevelt's increasing level of indecision, haphazardness and insouciance. <fnote>Paul Conkin, The New Deal (London, 1968), p.87 </fnote><fnote>Paul Conkin, The New Deal (London, 1968), p.71 </fnote>The precipitous recession of the economy in 1937 was a deeply intensifying factor in the disillusionment of the New Deal. The significant impact upon state of employment, which remained at an intolerable level of ten million in 1939, only a couple of million fewer than it had been in 1929, enhanced this disenchantment. Furthermore, 'the one-third ill-fed and ill-housed and the two-thirds alienated and desperate, still existed, in spite off the New Deal and in spite of all that welfare." The ultimate failure of the New Deal in its endeavours to 'lift the nation entirely out of depression' rested in its inability to completely solve the overwhelming issue of unemployment and 'hard-core poverty.' <fnote>Alonzo Hamby, The New Deal: Analysis and Interpretation (New York, c.1981), p.4 </fnote><fnote>Paul Conkin, The New Deal (London, 1968), p.81 </fnote><fnote>Alonzo Hamby, The New Deal: Analysis and Interpretation (New York, c.1981), p.4 </fnote><fnote>Alonzo Hamby, The New Deal: Analysis and Interpretation (New York, c.1981), p.5 </fnote>However, it is significant that the New Dealers appreciated that they had 'only come part of the way', although they recognised that even their narrow success surpassed the achievements of earlier governments. Despite the fact that Roosevelt's solutions were incomplete, it is justified by Schlesinger that 'all great problems are insoluble', thus the New Deal was capped in terms of successes. <fnote>William Leuchtenburg, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, 1932-1940 (New York, 1963), p.347 </fnote><fnote>Arthur Schlesinger (Jr.), 'The Broad Accomplishments of the New Deal', in, Edwin Rozwenc (ed.), The New Deal: Revolution or Evolution? (Boston, Mass., 1959), p.34 </fnote>Although the depression had petered out by 1938, it confirmed that 'the New Deal had not yet mastered economic cycles', demonstrating that its reforms were incomplete, 'imperfect, abortive, or ambiguous' idealistic policies. Furthermore, a spiralling national debt of three hundred billion dollars denotes the fact that there was increasing expenditure on relief and reform, yet there were few concrete successes ensuing from it. Davies goes to extremes with his radical claim that 'there is nothing the New Deal has done... that could not have been done better by an earthquake', in terms of establishing scarcity and putting survivors to work. <fnote>Paul Conkin, The New Deal (London, 1968), p.98 </fnote><fnote>Arthur Schlesinger (Jr.), 'The Broad Accomplishments of the New Deal', in, Edwin Rozwenc (ed.), The New Deal: Revolution or Evolution?

On the other hand, it is 'conceivable that New Deal measures would have led the country into a new cycle of prosperity even if there had been no war', as some gains had already been made in terms of reducing unemployment and, given time, it is argued that the New Deal would have been able to independently rehabilitate the United States. <fnote>William Leuchtenburg, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, 1932-1940 (New York, 1963), p.347 </fnote>Although it is believed that the New Deal recognised underrepresented minorities, such as Negroes, Conkin contends that they 'remained a submerged and neglected caste', outside of the margins of the contemporary equilibrium. It is important to identify that the successes of the New Deal did not always apply proportionately across the social spectrum. <fnote>Paul Conkin, The New Deal (London, 1968), p.93 </fnote>Nevertheless, 'the shortcomings of the New Deal vanish in the general perspective of its supreme success' and it was arguably 'quite successful in alleviating conditions and softening the brunt of the depression." It had 'performed its necessary tasks well' by securing jobs for many of unemployed and, largely as a result of this organised labour system and stabilised economy, 'most Americans were better off' and enjoyed an improved standard of living. Furthermore, the New Deal was adventitiously successful in restoring American confidence and reviving faith in democracy, the banking system, and the economy. <fnote>Arthur Schlesinger (Jr.), 'The Broad Accomplishments of the New Deal', in, Edwin Rozwenc (ed.), The New Deal: Revolution or Evolution?

(Boston, Mass., 1959), p.32 </fnote><fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.49 </fnote>In the long-term, the New Deal marked an era in which the President, for the first time in the history of American reform movements, 'took the reins of government' and played a greater interventionist role. The 'prestige...power' and legislative function of the President was significantly enhanced by the epoch of the New Deal and, accordingly, the White House became central in federal government, which itself had deeply broadened its influence in economic affairs. <fnote>Richard Hofstadter, The Age of Reform (New York, 1955), in, Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.72 </fnote><fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.85 </fnote>Moreover, a form of 'subsidised, regulated welfare capitalism still stands...as the core of American domestic politics', citing the New Deal as being prophetic in 'setting themes for subsequent political discourse', commencing with President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Essentially, the New Deal 'did initiate changes that led to long run success', including the maturation of the system of capitalist production that the economy remains based upon. Its accomplishments are thus 'still and essential part of the fabric of American society today.' <fnote>Paul Conkin, The New Deal (London, 1968), p.103 </fnote><fnote>Paul Conkin, The New Deal (London, 1968), p.103 </fnote><fnote>Paul Conkin, The New Deal (London, 1968), p.103 </fnote><fnote>Edwin Rozwenc (ed.), The New Deal: Revolution or Evolution? (Boston, Mass., 1959), p.vi </fnote>In conclusion, Roosevelt's New Deal did a 'remarkable job of handling an emergency of tremendous magnitude with no previous experience whatsoever." Although it did not immediately succeed its objective of lifting the nation out of the Great Depression, this does not diminish the role of the reform agencies nor the long-term successes upon the United States, both politically and socially. <fnote>Wallace Davies, The New Deal: Interpretations (New York, 1964), p.41 </fnote>Conkin wonderfully and succinctly reviews the course of the New Deal: 'the New Deal solved a few problems, ameliorated a few more, obscured many, and created new ones...only with trepidation will the student of history try to sum up the results of the New Deal.' <fnote>Paul Conkin, The New Deal (London, 1968), p.106 </fnote>
