<heading> Exercise AEstimation of the gross energy content of foods using the bomb calorimeter. </heading> FORMULA  Therefore, temperature change for 1g of benzoic acid;  FORMULA  In order to work out kcal/g/Â°C, the thermal capacity for the bomb calorimeter must be defined.  FORMULA  The Bomb calorimeter has thus been calibrated, allowing the necessary means to work out the gross energy (GE) content from a sample of biscuit. According to the manufacturers estimate, the GE should be 4.7kcal/g.  FORMULA  <heading>Conclusion</heading>The results from the experiment appeared to have a slightly higher GE content than that of the estimate of the manufacturer. However, the results can be considered to be fairly accurate as there was only a slight difference observed. The differences in the two GE contents could be due to types of machinery used, human error in method, sample of biscuit, or possibly the numerous data used by the manufacturer. <heading>Exercise BAssessment of food intake, nutrient composition and energy balance. </heading>The aim of this exercise was to assess food intake over a period of five days, estimate the intake of nutrients and relate this to the subjects' energy needs and expenditure. <heading>Values at the start of the five day trial. </heading> FORMULA  According to the body weight to height ratio diagram, the subject falls into the category of Band 4 (BMI 30-40). Grade II obesity, needing to lose weight, due to increased health risk with aging. Therefore it would be beneficial to the subject to attempt to lose weight. <heading>Nutrient Intake</heading>The food diary kept was converted used to produce a summary table ('Interactive food facts,' British Nutrition Foundation) that shows the subjects intakes for energy, protein and other components over the five day trial period. <table/>The subject may or may not be consuming an excess of nutrients, therefore daily energy expenditure must be taken into consideration. <heading>Energy Expenditure</heading>A program devised to work out the daily energy expenditure ('Introduction to Nutrition and Metabolism,' DA Bender 2002) took into consideration the subjects age, weight and height, and calculated how many kcals were consumed daily. All different forms of exercise were recorded over the five day period, as well as nutrient intake. It was necessary to do so in order to assess the subjects' requirements for nutrients. These tables represent how many hours were spent doing different levels of activity in relation to energy expenditure, and have been summarised in the form of a bar graph. The results are based on the subjects' physiological details. <table/><table/><figure/><heading>Theoretical weight loss at 20% over five weeks</heading>The program used for daily energy expenditure could also simulate a theoretical weight loss over a five week period, taking 20% less of kcals into consideration. <table/>This table shows that only 20% less in nutrient intake would benefit the subject as approximately 2.1kg weight loss would be achieved over a five week period. <heading>Values at the end of the trial</heading> FORMULA  According to the body weight to height ratio diagram, the subject still falls into Band 4 (BMI 30-40). According to the data, the subject is in slight deficit of nutrient intake, which has been illustrated in a weight loss of 0.5kg. This is a result of the intake of nutrients not being sufficient to cover the daily energy expenditure, with the body having to use stored energy taken from adipose tissue. Using the data provided by the trial, the pie chart below summarises the balance between nutrient intake and energy expenditure. It is this negative balance represented that is responsible for the weight loss of 0.5kg. <figure/><heading>Conclusion</heading><heading>Nutrient intake</heading>Looking at the data provided from the program, I feel that it is somewhat inaccurate. Although the program had many different types of foodstuffs with its nutritional composition broken down, there were many types of foods that weren't included. The foods in the diary most often had to be broken down into individual ingredients and entered that way. For example, a portion of lasagne, was very hard to assume exactly just how much mince, pasta, cheese sauce was used. There is also the factor of the ingredients not being listed in the program. It was also difficult to assume the exact weight of the foods, which could alter the amount of Kcal's consumed per day, making it a lower number. Another factor that should be taken into consideration is that different food labels/brands have different nutritional composition for their products, and are not necessarily the same as the standard items found on the program. <heading>Energy expenditure</heading>According to the data present, it appeared that more kcals were used in energy expenditure than consumed via nutrient intake. The program worked out my Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) as standard, however the BMR of an individual can depend on a number of other factors than just weight, gender, and age, such as tissue composition, and whether found in a continuously neutral thermal environment. It can vary from person to person due to circumstances. I conclude that the program is fairly accurate in estimating the levels of energy expenditure, but should not be taken literally as solid data. <heading>Nutrient Intake and energy expenditure balance</heading>Although there are many flaws with both programs, the data is conclusive with the overall results. There were not enough nutrients provided for daily energy requirements, and therefore stored energy in adipose tissue had to be used. The results comply with the weight loss of 0.5kg, however accurate or inaccurate the program data may be. As my Body mass index (BMI) is in Band 4, it would be advisable to continue the balance assumed as it would show positive results in weight loss, which is desirable for good health.
