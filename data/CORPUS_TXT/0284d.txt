<heading>1. Situation overview</heading>The case at hand deals with an internet start-up which was founded at the height of the dotcom boom and - unlike many others - has managed to grow in the following years. Its number of employees has gone up significantly since the time of writing of the case, namely from 8 to 15. The firm is still classified to be in its growth stage. Its only product is a B2B software for managing expense claims accessed entirely through browsers, which may also be a microbrowser installed on a portable device. The software is not sold - instead, companies are required to pay a monthly fee of currently 5Â£ per user for access to the service running on Signifo's servers. This constitutes the unique selling point of their solution - being accessible worldwide and not necessitating a software package to be bought, installed and maintained. <fnote>Tornado Insider,  URL , accessed 19/03/06 </fnote><heading>2. Market environment</heading>The company's first and foremost competition comes from the expense claim procedures already in operation in almost every company. They may be informal in a small business or very bureaucratic in a big business. Either way, they exist and procedures have to be changed in order to introduce the Signifo service marketed as WebExpenses. However, the inadequacy of these processes is the main point of attack. The only direct competitor is Concur, a North American company which is also present in the UK and Australian market. They have been in the business since 1993 and claim to be market leader. Their customer base is more diverse and the focus is on larger companies. Signifo is seeking an opportunity in the middle market, thereby attacking Concur. <fnote> URL , accessed 19/03/06 </fnote>In fact, there seems to be a host of expense reporting software available. For example, ExpensAble ( URL ) offers enterprise-wide solutions including a version for palmtops, which also makes filing reports possible while on the road. In spite of a stiff market, the reference list on Signifo's website features companies from an impressive range of industries and sizes. There seems to be a perceived benefit of outsourcing expense management. <heading>3.

Issues facing the company</heading>Having been so successful so far, management is looking into further growth opportunities, but doesn't want to jeopardise their achievements. <heading>Problem statement</heading><quote>"[Directors] now face the dilemma of whether to concentrate on that customer base and remain a small tight team or whether to expand to grab the middle market opportunity that is presenting itself." - Case study</quote>The directors have to make a decision about whether to remain in their comfortable but small market niche or whether to risk entering a new market segment that is already hard-fought. Following the small business strategy process framework, this means going back to the first stage (pre-strategy), which involves deciding on the scale and scope of the market. <fnote>Lecture notes week 7 </fnote><heading>5. Further analysis</heading><heading>5.1. PEST analysis</heading>In order to get a clear picture of the industry, various factors have to be considered. <heading>Political</heading>In every country there are different regulations regarding expense claims - whether they are tax deductible etc. Signifo does not have this know-how, but it can rely on resellers, who market the product under their own brand to produce localised versions. However, at the moment, no such contracts exist. <heading>Economic</heading>There is obviously a lot of pressure to save costs and a service like WebExpenses can accomplish this goal by reducing the administrative overhead, thus allowing employees to be more efficient. Another advantage of outsourcing is that the costs of the service are known beforehand, thus making planning easier. Overall, economic trends favour the adoption of WebExpenses in any kind of business. (See also under technological.) <heading>Social</heading>Working from home, from a client site or from any other place is becoming usual practice, so the number of expense claims is likely to increase. <heading>Technological</heading>Signifo is offering a highly scalable service, so the main goal has to be to maximise the number of subscribers. Acquiring large firms as customers increases the number of users dramatically, with profits going up accordingly. <heading>5.2. Five forces analysis</heading>Porter's five forces analysis is very valuable in this case, as it highlights the strengths as well as the stumbling blocks of the proposed extension. As mentioned before, Concur is already where Signifo would like to be, but then again, one competitor doesn't make a market crowded, so the opportunities prevail. When serving large companies, Signifo will have to face a much more significant bargaining power, meaning they will have to offer them discounts and additional services, and, as Mr Brewis (managing director) acknowledges, "invest in a field-based sales team". Overall, the return per user will be lower in this market. Market research would help to get some figures here. Another threat comes from the systems which those companies have developed for their own use. Developing proprietary software is not a viable solution for SMEs (they might still use Excel instead), but it becomes more viable as size increases. It is hard to imagine a company with 1000s of employees doing it without IT support. It would be decisively harder to convince these customers to buy from Signifo. Large investments in marketing would be necessary. Furthermore, there are expenses modules available from most ERP vendors, e.g. SAP Mobile Time and Travel. Signifo, however, claims they are too expensive, too difficult to implement and too difficult to use. These arguments hold for small firms, but less so for larger ones, as they can afford to employ, say, an SAP specialist. The user friendliness argues for Signifo in any case, as emphasized in the Heineken case study. This is not saying WebExpenses does not integrate with SAP and other systems (e.g. Peoplesoft). In fact, customers like Heineken seem very happy with it. <fnote> URL  </fnote><fnote> URL  </fnote><fnote> URL  </fnote>Lastly, we look at potential entrants. Considering Signifo has managed to get a product on the market so quickly, even as a small start-up, it is easy to imagine others start-ups could follow its successful example and do the same. Diversification could give Signifo a competitive advantage and make it harder for new entrants to catch up. The following table sums up the findings of Porter's five forces analysis. <heading>Summary</heading><table/><heading>5.3. SWOT analysis</heading>The insight gained in the previous steps leads to the following strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats matrix: <table/>Having identified these, we can develop and evaluate strategies using a SWOT / TOWS matrix: <fnote>Heuristics by  URL  </fnote><table/>The strategies range from defensive to very offensive (aggressive) - this should of course not be understood as a judgement. Each one entails some risks - even the more conservative ones. The final strategy should consequently be a combination of the above in order to avoid those risks and exploit opportunities. <heading>6. Central questions - and some answersThe questions every entrepreneur must answer - according to Amar Bhide<fnote> Adapted from the lecture notes on diagnosis</fnote></heading>Before going ahead to make a judgement, a few fundamental questions need to be answered. <heading>1. Are my goals well-defined? </heading><heading>1.1. What type of enterprise do I need to build? </heading>We'll assume that long-term sustainability is what drives the founders of the business. <heading>1.2. What risks and sacrifices does such a business demand? </heading>Again, a long-term business orientation is assumed, requiring more risk as well as delegation/licensing/outsourcing ... <heading>2. Do I have the right strategy? </heading><heading>2.1. Is the strategy well-defined? </heading>The SWOT analysis has resulted in several well-defined strategies. In reality, things are not as clear-cut. A possible perspective for the future is outlined in the next section. <heading>2.2. Can the strategy generate sufficient profits and growth? </heading>Market analysis shows that there is a large potential for growth in the mid-market. The competition is highly profitable, but scarce. <heading>2.3. Is the strategy sustainable? </heading>Nothing indicates an imminent slump in demand for corporate software. Well-integrated solutions have excellent prospects. The additional income could help extend the product range. <heading>2.4. Are my goals for the business too aggressive or too conservative? </heading>Not acting would be too conservative. There is no internal funding problem and economies of scale are not exhausted. Think of the scalability argument mentioned above. <heading>3. Can I execute the strategy? </heading><heading>3.1. Do I have the right resources and relationships? </heading>A shift in the customer base is not uncommon at this stage. At the moment, there is no replacement for them, though. Relationships to new customers and partners have to be forged first. Another point is the lack of employees, so the interpersonal skills of the founders play an integral role when it comes to finding the right people (which, at this point, will have a big impact on the company's culture). <heading>3.2. How strong is the organisation? </heading>Formal procedures and controls have to be introduced, maintaining efficiency and the advantages of a small firm, but keeping it manageable. Again, this depends a lot on the personalities and experience of the founders. For instance, they have to be able to delegate and relinquish control to others. <heading>7. Conclusions and recommendations</heading>Signifo is going through a phase that is typical for companies of its size, namely making the transition from family/small team business to being a serious enterprise. Some entrepreneurs defer this step for too long as can be seen from the PCD Malton case. The founders of Signifo, however, seem motivated and capable enough to run on a more innovative strategy. The only question is, how to do it. First of all, they should try to defend the small business market as a steady source of income. There is a danger of neglecting loyal customers and thus alienating them. They should not even notice that they are becoming less significant. At this stage of development of the firm, some structural changes are necessary. My recommendation would be a staged approach in order to ease the transition and to minimize the risk. It would be a good idea work with distributors on a commission basis to begin with. This way, the company has more time to train a sales team of its own, which is unavoidable in the medium term. This concept works well in conjunction with the product licensing scheme proposed by management, because companies experienced in potential markets complement Signifo's strengths. They also have more reliable marketing and distribution channels. Consequently, finding a good partner is one of the first steps to undertake. Depending on the financial capabilities of the company, the imminent steps could be financed entirely by the company's house bank and own reserves. It is not necessary to look for venture capital at this point. That would only be necessary for the riskier alternative, as investments in sales and support can be expected to take some time until they yield returns. At the same time, they should not forget the importance to stay ahead of the pack in terms of product quality and state-of-the-art features, so there should always be sufficient resources for continuous innovation. Overall, it would be a mistake not to be proactive in the current situation, as the opportunity cost incurred would be much higher.
