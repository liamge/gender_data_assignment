<abstract><heading>Summary</heading>The purpose of this report is to investigate the performance characteristics (e.g. efficiency and input power) of a centrifugal pump running at 2000 and 3000 RPM. Using a pump test rig provided by PLINT ltd, various operating conditions are tested, and the corresponding output behaviour is recorded. The data is expressed by performance curves, which indicate the most favourable operating conditions of the pump. By performing a dimensional analysis, various non-dimensional groups can be devised to provide a representation of the relationship between the performance characteristics. The experiment proves that the centrifugal pump used, has an optimal efficiency of 48% when operated at approximately 3000 RPM. The generation of pump performance curves provides an indication of the amount of head which must be overcome in order for the pump to operate at a particular flow. These curves also indicate the ideal operating conditions for the pump, and also the range of conditions in which the pump can be operated within safely, without causing any damage to the machinery. It is evident that the pump should be run at approximately 3000 RPM at a discharge of no greater than 1.8 litres/sec, in order to achieve optimal performance. </abstract><heading>Apparatus</heading>The experiment is performed using the following equipment: PLINT and Partners single stage centrifugal pump test rig. (See Fig 1, Appendix A for more details) This rig includes the following: <list>Variable Pump Speed - 3000RPM max.Spring Balance - Input Force MeasurementVenturi Meter ManometerSuction and Delivery Pressure Gauges</list>The experimental measurements are all taken from the test rig. The variable speed is provided by a thyristor controlled dynamometer, and is displayed by a digital read out. The suction and delivery pressures are controlled by gate valves, and the values of each are displayed by two analogue gauges. The Input force measurement is provided by means of a spring balance. <heading>Method</heading>The suction valve is opened and the discharge valve is fully closed The pump is activated and run at maximum speed (3000rpm) The delivery valve is then opened fully to ensure that any air in the system is cleared. Initially, the pump is set to 2000RPM At this value of pump speed, the suction and delivery pressure is recorded. (note that the suction pressure is interpreted as negative) The force is determined by adjusting the level of the spring balance, to coincide with the fixed pointer. <fnote>Note, the accuracy of the readings taken depends heavily on the ability of determining when the spring balance is aligned perfectly with the fixed pointer. </fnote>The manometer reading is then taken. Steps 5, 6 and 7 are then repeated for various settings of the delivery valve. Steps 4 through 8 are then repeated a second time for a pump speed of 3000RPM. <heading>Theory</heading>The centrifugal pump used in this experiment converts the electrical energy of the motor, first into kinetic energy, then into pressure energy of the fluid that is being pumped. The pressure difference between the suction and delivery valves can be expressed in terms of head, where: Total Head = Delivery - Suction Pressure Since the flow is incompressible, in accordance with Bernoulli's equation the total pressure in head is:  FORMULA ~Eqn. 1 Where ( = mass density of water The term 'Head', provides an indication of the amount of kinetic energy which is imparted to the liquid by the pump, and thus can be used to determine the output power. The output power of the pump is determined by:  FORMULA ~Eqn. 2 However,  FORMULA   FORMULA  <list><heading>Where </heading> Q=Volumetric Flow Rate v=Velocity A=Area F=Force</list>Therefore  FORMULA ~Eqn. 3 The volumetric flow rate is determined by the manufacturer's calibration of the pump rig, where:  FORMULA ~Eqn. 4 <list><heading>Where Q=Discharge (l /s)</heading> c=Calibration Constant (set by manufacturer) h=Manometer Reading (mmHg)</list>Note, in this case, the calibration constant = 0.0981 Since the principal objective is to analyse the performance characteristics of the pump, the output power must be compared with the input power in order to obtain the efficiency of the pump. The input power required by the impeller is therefore:  FORMULA ~Eqn. 5 <list><heading>Where T=Torque</heading> (=Angular Velocity</list>The performance characteristics of any pump system can be demonstrated through the use of performance curves. These chart the characteristics of a pump at varying operating conditions, and provide a means of estimating the way in which a pump will behave in a certain situation. (The theory behind the construction of pump performance curves is provided in appendix B). The concept of non-dimensional groups enables us to summarise the experimental results obtained, and to determine their functional relationship. Dimensional analysis is often used when a phenomenon is too complicated to derive a formula to describe it. By identifying groups of variables which would appear in such a formula, along with the addition of experimental data, an analytical relationship can be formed. The dimensional analysis is commonly performed using the Buckingham Method. (The theory of the Buckingham method is provided in appendix C). The non-dimensional groups formed by dimensional analysis are as follows: Power Coefficient =  FORMULA ~Eqn. 6 Flow Coefficient =  FORMULA ~Eqn. 7 Pressure Rise =  FORMULA ~Eqn. 8 <list><heading>Where f = Frequency (Hz)</heading> D= Impeller Diameter (given to be = 0.095m)</list><heading>Sample Computations</heading>The following is a sample of the readings taken, along with the calculations performed: <list>Recorded Suction Pressure = -0.16 BARRecorded Delivery Pressure = 0.68 BARRecorded Force Measurement = 6.0 NManometer Reading = 277 mm HgRecorded Speed = 2987 RPM</list>With the recorded values for delivery and suction pressure the change in pressure is given by:  FORMULA  Using equation 1, the pressure change corresponds to:  FORMULA  By converting the recorded force into a torque, the input power can be calculated using equation 5:  FORMULA  Where the torque arm length = 0.179m (Note, the speed has been converted into SI units (rad/s)) The discharge from the pump is calculated using the manometer reading along with equation 4:  FORMULA  With the discharge calculated, the output power can be determined using equation 3:  FORMULA  With values calculated for input and output power, the efficiency is obtained as a ratio of the two values where:  FORMULA  In order for further analysis to be made, the variables are entered into the non-dimensional groups (equations 6, 7 and 8): Pressure Rise  FORMULA  Flow Coefficient  FORMULA  Power Coefficient  FORMULA  Where D = Impeller Diameter = 0.095m Due to the extensive calculations required for each set of variables, the remaining calculations have been performed using the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet program. These results, along with the estimated margin of error for each reading are given in the following section. <heading>Observations and Results:</heading>As the delivery pressure is increased by adjustment of the gate valve, the suction pressure decreases accordingly. It is found that once the delivery pressure is set, by adjustment of the gate valve, this value slowly begins to deviate, due to inadequate performance of the valve. It is also apparent from the experiment, that as the speed of the pump increases, the fluid manometer oscillates with increasing amplitude. Since the manometer fluctuates more at higher speeds, this has a considerable affect on the accuracy of the readings taken. The reason for this effect is attributed to the increased flow velocity which results in an increased Reynolds number, and thus, a less laminar flow. The results obtained from the experiment along with the non-dimensional groups and performance characteristics are shown below in the following table. For each measurement of pressure, force and manometer reading, the estimated error has been included based on the observations made above. Note that in table 2, the error associated with the pressure/manometer readings are greater than that shown in table 1. This is due to the increased flow velocity causing the gauges to fluctuate more. <table/><table/>In table 1, it is apparent that some values are missing for the discharge, efficiency and one of the dimensionless groups. The reason for this is due to the manometer reading being negative. Since the calculation of flow discharge requires the square root of the manometer reading, this would be impossible in this case. Therefore, the output power, efficiency and the non-dimensional group which rely on the flow discharge must be omitted. The negative manometer readings are attributed to the experimental errors discussed above. Ideally, the manometer should not have passed below zero and hence the results would be complete. However, for the purpose of the analysis, this data will be excluded. A graphical representation of the performance characteristics and the dimensionless groups are shown in the following pages. <heading>Discussion:</heading>The table of results shows the predicted trend that as the delivery pressure decreases, the flow velocity increases. The estimated errors associated with the measured quantities are based on the observations made during the experiment. For example, the crudity of the force measurement, using the spring balance is quite inaccurate, since it depends on the ability to determine the exact balance point. During the experiment, it was observed that as the velocity of flow increases, the errors associated with the pressure and manometer gauges also increase. This is attributed to an increased Reynolds number causing a more unstable flow in the pump. As a result, the manometer and pressure gauges begin to oscillate. The gate valves used on the rig also affect the precision that can be obtained, since the gauges are not very sensitive to changes in the valve openings. This could be improved if the rig included a different type of valve, such as a globe valve, which is far better suited for more precise regulation. The errors and uncertainties could also be reduced in the experiment by simply increasing the number of readings taken. The results also show that the pump efficiency peaks at 48%, at ~3000 RPM. The losses encountered consist mainly of gravitational losses, pressure differential losses and frictional losses, caused by the piping and the valves. The results confirm that as the flow increases, the frictional losses also increase, but at a higher rate. Graph 1 shows a graphical representation of the pump performance at both operating speeds. The discharge is plotted against the total head to provide the pump system curve. If a specific flow rate was required for a particular purpose, the system curve indicates the total head which must be overcome at that flow. The 'total head' plots in graph 1 show the pumps range of operations, from the shut-off head point (zero flow) to the run-out point (max. flow) (see appendix B). The pump can be operated under a wider variety of conditions at 3000 RPM, since the range of the 'total head' plot is far greater at 3000 RPM, than at 2000 RPM. Beyond the run-out point of the 'total head' plot, the pump itself is at risk from an effect known as cavitation. This effect occurs when cavities form in the fluid which is being pumped. If such cavities form at the suction of the pump, the efficiency of the pump will drop, and damage to the pump will be inevitable. The pump is therefore limited to a flow of 1.8 litres/sec at 3000 RPM or 1.2 litres/sec at 2000 RPM. <fnote>Cavitation information provided by -  URL  </fnote>The graph also indicates the best efficiency point of each pump speed. At 2000 RPM this corresponds to 44% at a discharge of 0.71 litres/sec, and at 3000 RPM the best efficiency point lies at 48% at 1.14 litres/sec. The points of best efficiency represent the ideal operating conditions of the pump. Graph 2 indicates the graphical representation of the non-dimensional groups calculated as part of the analysis of the data. The graph shows considerable similarity between the data sets, at both speeds. If the dimensional analysis is indeed correct, theory indicates that the curves should collapse on each other, as all important parameters will have been included. Although the curves are not perfect, it is reasonable to assume that this is the case, due to errors/uncertainties. Hence, the expressions relating the torque, flow and pressure rise, to density, impeller diameter and frequency must be correct. <heading>Conclusions</heading>The centrifugal pump used in the experiment has a peak efficiency of 48% when running at ~3000 RPM. It is most suited to this speed, as it can be operated at a greater variety of operating conditions without adding excessive strain on the pump components. The input power required by the impeller follows an approximately linear relationship with the flow discharge. There are numerous errors associated with the results from the experiment. These errors originate from the measured quantities, such as delivery/suction pressure and the manometer readings. The errors are more severe at the greater speed, due to unstable flow. The graphs of the performance characteristics provide an indication of the amount of head which must be overcome for the pump to run at a specific flow discharge. By performing dimensional analysis on the experimental parameters, a number of expressions have been constructed to provide a relationship between these parameters. Graphical analysis of the non-dimensional groups confirms the validity of these expressions.
