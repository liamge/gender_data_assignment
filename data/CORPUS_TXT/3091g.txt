<list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list><heading>Introduction</heading>This report is to investigate the properties of an I section beam when subjected to a pure torsional load. I beams are generally used in structures where loads supported by the beam cause bending. The I beam section is ideally suited to supporting high bending loads. Similarly circular shafts or tubes are most suited to torsional loading conditions, and where possible the two different structural members are chosen by the loads imposed on them. However it is not always possible for an I beam to be subjected to just bending loads, or a shaft to be subjected to only torsional loads, so it is important to be able to accurately predict the effects of torsional or bending loads on the relevant beams. A straight I beam section approximately 1m in length will be loaded with a pure torsional load. Strain gauge readings attached to the beams surface will be used to monitor the strains in the beam as the load is applied. FE Analysis and theoretical calculations will be compared to these experimental results and comparisons made between the three methods. <heading>Objectives</heading>The main objectives of this report are: Determine the region on the I section beam where yielding will be expected to occur first Determine the torsional load at which yielding will begin to occur on the I beam. Determine for each of the three methods the stress profile over the boundary of the section at its critical load The expected outcomes of this investigation are that the results obtained from the three methods being investigated should all produce similar results, from past experiences the FE analysis tends to provide the highest yield load, with basic theoretical calculations providing an accurate prediction of the I beams performance. <heading>Theory</heading>As already stated, I beam sections are used for supporting loads in bending. However design constraints may lead to the beam being subjected to more than just plain bending loads. An example of such a scenario would be fixing services, piping or electrical wiring for instance to an I beam structural support section. If this load is attached to the I section away from its central axis, then an eccentric loading condition is created, and the beam is no longer subjected to pure bending loads. It is therefore important that torsional loads on the beam be taken into account when designing structures to ensure the operational stresses do not exceed the designated limits. <heading>Theoretical Analysis</heading>The calculations used in this report for determining the maximum torsion required to cause the I section beam to yield are based on the formula's given by Roark & Griffith. <enote>Young W.C & Budynas R.G "Roark's Formulas for Stress and Strain", 7th Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2002 </enote>Both formulas take an I section beam as shown in Figure 2.1, break it down in to separate rectangular sections and determine for each section its relative torsional stiffness. Roark's formula is the simplest form, only taking into account the equivalent rectangular sections, Griffith's also takes into account any taper in the flanges and also the effect of the radius between the flange and web sections. <figure/><heading>Prandtl's Membrane Analogy</heading>Prandtl's membrane analogy is a way of determining where on a section the shear stress are likely to be highest when subjected to a torsional load. The analogy simply takes the shape in question, and assumes a membrane covers the end of the shape. If that membrane is then subjected to a uniform internal pressure (much like blowing a bubble with soapy water) the membrane expands from the end of the shape. Where the gradient of this membrane is at its maximum value, this is the region of highest stress in the shape. An example of the membrane analogy can be seen in Figure 2.2 for a T section beam. It can be seen that the maximum gradient and hence shear stress occurs at the junction of the flange and web of the T section. <figure/>Using the prandtl's membrane analogy it is possible to predict the location of maximum shear stress on the I section being investigated in this report. From Figure 2.2, which is essentially half of the I section beam, the maximum shear stress occurs at the junction of the flange and web. Therefore the maximum shear stress in the I section beam is expected to be around the fillet region of the beams at the flange and web junctions. <heading>Warping</heading>When torsional loads are applied to an I section beam that is not constrained axially and thus is free to deform in the axial direction, then owing to the transverse shear stresses (shear stresses in the flange) there is a variation in longitudinal complementary shear stress which results in axial movement of one flange with respect to the other. Therefore sections initially in plane no longer remain so during torsion, this is known as warping. <enote>Benham, PPal. "Mechanics of Engineering Materials", 2nd Edition, Longman Singapore Publishers Ltd, 1996 </enote>If one end is constrained in such a way as to prevent warping, then the amount of warping along the beam is reduced. The effect of the restraint to warping is most significant near the constrained ends, and reduces with distance from the constraint so that after several section depths the influence of the warping is negligible. However compatibility requires that the warping sections match at each section along the beam. The result of this warping constraint is to resist the torque by simple torsion and also by torque setup through the restraint to warping. Therefore the applied torque will have a smaller angle of twist than a section with unrestrained ends, and hence the torsional stiffness may be considerably increased. Figure 2.3 shows an I beam with one end built in subject to a torsional load. Near the built in end, the effect of the torsional load produced mainly lateral shear, shown be section (a), as the distance from the built in end increases, section (b) the shear in the section is partial lateral shear and partial torsional shear. At the section near where the torsional load is applied the shear is mainly torsional. <figure/>According to Saint-Venant's principle the distance at which the effects of the built in end are no longer present can be determined by measuring the height of the I section, and dawning circles axially along the beam with diameters the size of the I section height. After a couple of beam diameters the shear in the beam is assumed to be mainly torsional. <heading>Roark's</heading>For a state of equilibrium in the I section the follow must be true  FORMULA  Equation 2.1 - Torsional Equilibrium Where the sum of the torsion in each rectangular section is equal to the total torsion of the I section. It is therefore possible to derive from this equation the value of torsion in each rectangular section and hence the shear stress. Also for compatibility the following must be true  FORMULA  Equation 2.2 - Twist per unit length compatibility Where the twist per unit length of each rectangular section is equal to the twist per unit length of the whole I section. From Figure 2.1 the equivalent I section is broken down in to separate rectangular sections, as show in Figure 2.4. <figure/> FORMULA  Equation 2.3 - Maximum shear stress of rectangular section  FORMULA  Equation 2.4 - Torsional stiffness of rectangular section  FORMULA  Equation 2.5 - Twist per unit length <heading>Griffith</heading>As already stated, the Griffith formula's take into account the radius between the flange and fillet, the formula's listed below show how these features are taken into account. The torsional stiffness constant, K is modified by the addition of the effects of the curvature stiffness off the fillets. Figure 2.5 shows how the value for inscribed circle, D is determined, by drawing a circle tangent to the 3 edges of the shape.  FORMULA  Equation 2.6 - Griffith K-Value  FORMULA  Equation 2.7 - Corner stiffening constant  FORMULA  Equation 2.8 - Determining K-Values θ <figure/> FORMULA  Equation 2.9 - Curvature Constant The maximum shear stress in an open shape is defined in Equation 2.10. This maximum shear stress will occur for an I Beam section at the fillets at the junction between the web and flange.  FORMULA  Equation 2.10 - Maximum Shear Stress <heading>Experimental Measurements</heading>The most common method of measuring stress in experimental tests is the use of electrical resistance gauges, or strain gauges. "Strain gauges are based on the principle that the resistance, R, of a conductor changes as a function of normal strain, ε. The resistance of a conductor can be expressed as shown in Equation 2.11, where ρ is the resistively of the conductor (ohms per unit length) and L and A are the length and cross-sectional area of the conductor respectively" 1.  FORMULA  Equation 2.11 - Electrical Resistance A typical rectangular rosette of strain gauges can be seen in Figure 2.6. <figure/><heading>Stress strain relationship</heading>From the rectangular rosette shown in Figure 2.6, the corresponding strains can be determined as shown in Equation 2.12.  FORMULA  Equation 2.12 - Strain conversion from rosette Strain gauges can only measure plain strain. However in pure torsion the shear stress is the desired value. The shear stress acts perpendicular and parallel to the plane in which the torsion is applied. Since maximum shear stress occurs at 45° to plain stress, the strain gauges are placed on the component at 45° to the torsion axis. From the plain strains the shear strains can be determined using Equation 2.13.  FORMULA  Equation 2.13 - Shear Stress calculation When the rectangular rosette shown in Figure 2.6 is replaced with a single strain gauge positioned at 45°, the strain values for gauges A & C in Equation 2.13 can be assumed to be zero. Therefore the shear strain expressed as a gradient is shown in Equation 2.14.  FORMULA  Equation 2.14 - Shear Strain Gradient The shear stress is found using Equation 2.15, where G is the shear modulus found using Equation 2.16.  FORMULA  Equation 2.15 - Shear Stress  FORMULA  Equation 2.16 - Shear Modulus In terms of plain stresses, the stresses are calculated from the plain strains using Equation 2.17.  FORMULA  Equation 2.17 - Plain Strain Stress relationship For pure torsion, the failure criteria for Tresca and Von Mises simplify down to:  FORMULA  Equation 2.18 - Failure Criteria <heading>Finite Element Analysis</heading>Finite Element Analysis is an analytical process, which utilises modern computational systems to solve complex simultaneous, algebraic equations. These algebraic equations are the result of subdividing a complex shape into many discrete, interconnected, simple shapes. An accurate model of the I beam section is constructed, the model is then broken down into thousands of simple shapes (in this lab tetrahedrals) by meshing the 3D model as shown in Figure 2.7. <figure/>Loads and constraints are added to the model to simulate the actual loading conditions, and material properties are assigned to the model. The system then solves equations for each point in the mesh (known as nodes). The results are displayed graphically showing such data as stress, strain displacement for each of the nodes in the model. <heading>Procedure</heading>This section will detail the procedure for each of the three methods being investigated in this report, namely: <list>Theoretical analysis based on Griffth and Roark's modificationsExperimental strain gauge measurementsFinite Element Analysis</list><heading>Theoretical Calculations</heading>The complete working for the hand calculations to determine the torsional load a yield, and stress distribution around the I section's profile can be seen in Appendix 2. <heading>Experimental Measurements</heading>For a detailed description of setting up the test equipment refer to Appendix 1, this describes how to connect up the strain gauges and calibrate the system. <list><heading>The equipment used in the practical testing was:</heading>I Beam SectionTorsion Rig (Avery Dennison 20,000Nm)P3500 Strain IndicatorSB10 Balance & Switch (x2)</list>The I beam section used for the testing can be seen in Figure 3.1, the material properties for the I beam can be seen in Table 3.1. The Young's modulus for the material was assumed to be 200GPa, used for steel when actual measurements are not available. The yield stress for the material was determined through testing using a Vickers hardness testing machine. <table/>Length = 1.05m <figure/>There were 11 gauges mounted to the I section, the positions of which can be seen in Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3. When connecting the strain gauges to the SB10 Balance & switch unit, it is important to note on which channel each strain gauge is mounted, also for the rosette strain gauges it is important to note which direction each gauge is acting in. The beam was loaded until the highest strain gauge reading read 400με, then unloaded and reloaded to the same value. The beam was then loaded incrementally until 400με was recorded, then unloaded. The results of this test can be seen in Table 4.3. The beam section was mounted to a torsion loading machine, pictured in Figure 3.4. One end of the beam is fully constrained, the other is attached to a geared motor drive. This gradually applies a torsional load to the beam. <figure/><figure/><picture/><heading>FE Analysis</heading>The FE Analysis package that was used to model the I beam was SolidWorks 2005 with COSMOSWorks FE package. <enote>SolidWorks 3D CAD Package,  URL  (Accessed 26.01.06) </enote><enote>COSMOS FE Software,  URL  (Accessed 26.01.06)s </enote><heading>Geometry</heading>The dimensions of the 3D CAD model were those shown in Figure 3.1. Half the beam length was extruded, then mirrored about its central axis, this enabled a "split line" to be placed all the way down its central axis. This feature becomes of use when meshing the model. The presence of a split line means that the mesh nodes will terminate along the split line allowing results to be obtained along the beams cross section. An axis was constructed to run along the beams central axis, this would be used when applying the torsional load during analysis. As can be seen from this brief description of the CAD model geometry, it is advantageous to plan the modelling of the geometry construction so that additional features can be added that make the analysis process easier. <fnote>A line drawn perpendicular to a face, which can split a single face into two faces. </fnote>Split Line <table/><heading>Material Properties</heading>The material properties used for the analysis can be seen in Table 3.1, even though the software package has a built in material library, which lists all the common materials, a custom material was chosen to ensure that FE results were as close as possible to theoretical and practical results. <heading>Meshing</heading>The mesh type used in the analysis of the I beam section was a solid mesh 10 node tetrahedral, the mesh density for the beam was kept to the default size of 13.307mm, this can be seen in the left hand figure in Figure 3.5. Note that the presence of the split line causes the nodes to terminate against the line, the right hand figure is with mesh control added to the standard mesh this was achieved by selecting the split line to apply the mesh control to. <figure/><heading>Convergence Testing</heading>As stated earlier the default mesh was selected for the model of the I beam, mesh control was used to increase the mesh density around the critical region being examined. In this case it was the stress profile around the I beam section at its mid position. Various mesh sizes were tried, the results of which can be seen in Table 4.1, the results have been plotted and can be seen in Graph 4.2. By adding mesh control to only the critical region it minimises the computational time and resources, if the entire beam was meshed to the size of the mesh control there would be many more elements and the solution would be unnecessarily lengthy. The final mesh used on the model from which the results were obtained were as follows: <list>Main Mesh Size = 13.307mmMesh Control applied to split lines = 1.663mm</list><heading>Constraints</heading>The constraints on the model were constructed to simulate the practical lab setup. Figure 3.6 depicts how the model was constrained. The left hand end of the beam was fully constrained in all three axis to mimic a built in end. The right hand end of the beam was only constrained to prevent translation on the central axis on the beam. The torsional load was applied to the right hand face on two points as shown, and was 1Nm. <figure/><heading>Results</heading><heading>Strain Gauge Measurements</heading>The results obtained from applying torsional load to the I beam section and recording the strain gauge outputs can be seen in Table 4.3. The table shows for each strain gauge location and torsional load the strain gauge reading in microstrain and the equivalent stress. <heading>Determining Stresses</heading>The following method was used to determine the stress values from the recorded strain gauge values shown in Table 4.3. For the single strain gauges mounted at 45° to the beams central axis, (gauges 1 & 3-10), the follow calculation was used.  FORMULA  For the rosette strain gauges Equation 2.12 was used to determine the equivalent strains, this was then converted into plain stresses using εX & εY, or shear stress using ε45, using Equation 2.17 and Equation 2.15 respectively. An example of these calculations can be seen below. From Table 4.3, torsional load = 160Nm  FORMULA  <heading>Yield Load</heading>From the results in Table 4.3, the highest stresses occurred at strain gauge No.7 which was situated in the centre of the fillet (see Figure 3.2). These results can be seen plotted in Graph 4.1. The stress and strain gradient are listed next to the results. The yield stress for the material is 385 MPa, applying the failure criteria from Equation 2.18 yields a yield stresses of:  FORMULA  Using the stress gradient it is possible to predict the yield load of the I beam section.  FORMULA  <heading>FE Analysis</heading>The yield load determined from the results of the FE Analysis can be seen in Table 4.2, stress plots of the I beam section models analysed can be seen in Appendix 5. <heading>Mesh Convergence</heading>As discussed in the procedure section, mesh convergence was done on the I beam section to determine the mesh size that would produce results of acceptable accuracy whilst keeping computational time and recourses to a minimum. The results of this convergence testing can be seen in Table 4.1. <table/><heading>Theoretical Calculations</heading>The full workings for the Roark & Griffth theoretical calculations can be seen in Appendix 2. The results in this section are a summary of those hand calculations. An equation was developed to determine the maximum shear stress in the I beam section in terms or the applied torsional load, this was found to be:  FORMULA  Applying the failure criteria to the materials yield stress yield the maximum shear stress of the section,  FORMULA  Using these values for the maximum shear stress enables the maximum torsional load of the I beam section to be predicted. This are found to be;  FORMULA  The shear stress in the flanges was found to be:  FORMULA  where, a=77mm, b=9mm, the shear stress in the flanges at the yield load is found to be;  FORMULA  The shear stress in the web was found to be:  FORMULA  where, a=135mm, b=7mm, the shear stress in the flanges at the yield load is found to be;  FORMULA  <heading>Results Summary</heading><table/><heading>Results Stress Profiles</heading><figure/><table/><figure/><figure/><heading>Discussion</heading>The yield loads for the 3 methods discussed in this report can be seen summarised in Table 4.2. The stress profiles of the I beam section at yield load can be seen in Figure 4.1. <heading>Prandlt's </heading>Prandlt's membrane analogy is a method of determining where on a shape the maximum shear stresses are likely to occur when subjected to a pure torsional load. For the I beam section this was shown to be around the fillets at the junction of the flange and web. FE Analysis & Practical results show that the regions of highest stresses occur at these fillets, with the Roark & Griffth methods taking into account the effect of the radius on the maximum shear stresses. <heading>Theoretical Calculations</heading>The I beam section was broken down into simplified rectangular sections, where by applying the equations of equilibrium and compatibility, equations to define the proportion of torsional load in the separate rectangular sections, and hence the shear stress at yield load in the rectangular sections were determined. The maximum shear stress was calculated using the Griffth method which accounts for the additional fillets and tapered flanges. The predicted yield load for the I beam section was found to be 700Nm using the Tresca failure criteria and 808Nm using Von Mises. A spread sheet was created in order to investigate the effect of changing certain variables used in the calculations. Of interest was the effect that varying the depth of the flanges had on the yield load. With a flange depth of 9mm (as used in the hand calculations) the yield load for Tresca failure criteria was shown to be 700Nm. Increasing this flange depth to 10mm raises the yield load to 789.5Nm, rasing it further to 13mm produces a yield load of 1246.5Nm. Similarly varying the flange taper angle or the diameter of the inscribed circle had minimal effect on the yield load. It could be postulated therefore that the most effective way to increase the torsional stiffness of an I section beam would be to increase the depth of the flanges. It should be noted that the theoretical calculations used to determine the yield load of the I section beam use a much simplified model compared to the actual component. The values for shear stress in the flanges and webs are assumed to occur in the central sections of their respective rectangular sections. For the case of the web this shear stress value is considered to be an accurate representation of the actual shear stresses since it is in the centre of the longest edge of the rectangle. Referring back to Prandlt's membrane theory it was shown that the maximum shear stress in a rectangular section is near the ends of the rectangle, the gradient of the ensuing concaved membrane is constant along the longest edge of the rectangle and hence the shear stresses are constant, Figure 5.1 depicts this shear stress distribution. <figure/>The shear stress values for the flanges are not as clearly defined since in the centre of the rectangle where the shear stress value is calculated the web section joins to the flange. This can be illustrated by a plot of the shear stress across this region in the flange taken from the results obtained by the FE Analysis shown in Figure 5.2. This plot shows that the shear stresses are not constant across the centre section of the flange, hence the calculated shear stresses are only a prediction, and accuracy of the results can not be relied upon. Figure 5.2 also shows the stress plot along the web, showing the constant stress along most of its length. The hand calculations assume warping occurs and therefore contain no restraints on either of the ends of the beam. The practical results and FE Analysis restrain the I section beam at one end, preventing warping at that end. This will have effect on the results and direct comparison will not be possible. It can be seen from Table 4.2 that this is shown to be the case, where the yield load for the hand calculations is much less than either the FE Analysis or practical results. <figure/><heading>Finite Element Analysis</heading>The I beam section was modelled exactly in the software and analysed with a 1Nm torsional load. Shear stresses around the profile of the I section were read off using the shear stress functionality in the software. This was only possible in the regions parallel or perpendicular to the CAD models co-ordinate system. For the shear stresses in the fillet, the three principle stresses were measured and from this the shear stress calculated using the following equation.  FORMULA  Equation 5.1 - Calculating Shear Stress in the Fillet Where one of the principle stresses measured was approximately equal to zero since the stresses were being measured on the surface of the component. These stress gradients were then used to estimate the yield load for the beam section. The method used to constrain the model for the analysis was similar to that found in the practical lab. One end of the beam was built in, the other end had a point on the central axis of the beam preventing translation. Forces were applied to the central point in the top of the flanges to provide a turning moment. The constrains prevent warping of the beam at the built in end, but allow warping to occur at the other end of the beam, results were taken from the centre section of the beam as per the practical results. From the results in Table 4.2 it can be seen that the experimental and FE results are similar, the FE results appearing to be slightly lower than the practical results. The restraints used in the FE model were not a direct representation of those of the experimental setup owing to the way the torsional load was applied to the unrestrained face of the beam. This may be considered to effect the overall results, since warping on the practical lab was restricted at end of the beam we the torsional load was applied, where as the FEA had no warping restrictions at this end of the beam. The restraints on the FE model were modified, to allow warping of the beam, so as to resemble the theoretical calculations. The restraints on the built in end were modified to only restrain the top and bottom points down the centre line of the I section beams end face. This prevented the beam from rigid body motion, but allowed the ends of the beam to warp. Interia relief was selected from the options in the solver menus to account for any discrepancies during the solution owing to the minimal restraints imposed on the model. Figure 5.3 shows these revised constraints. <figure/>The results from this modified FE model produced yield loads much closer to those predicted by the theoretical calculations, which can be seen in Table 5.1. <table/>Slight variations in yield loads can be attributed to assumptions made by the FE software, such as perfect material (i.e no flaws in the material) and linear elastic up to the yield point. <heading>Practical Results</heading>As already discussed the end constraints on the beam for the practical testing were more restrictive to warping of the beam than both the FE Analysis and Theoretical calculations. The predicted yield stress for the practical calculations were based on strain gauge measurements taken from the centre of the beam. At this point in the beam according to Saint-Venant's principle there should be only stresses due to torsion present. According to this Saint-Venants principle the effect of the end restraint on the results should not be noticed past 2 x 153 = 306mm from the built in end of the beam. This principle suggests that the restraints on the beam in the experimental and initial FE model would have no effect on the results due to the distance from the ends exceeding 306mm. However the results indicate that this is not the case, where the FE model produced two different sets of results for differing end restraints, with the experimental and theoretical giving two different yield loads. Borsei4 gives modified equations for determining the stress in I beam section subjected to a torsional load with different end constraints. <heading>Conclusion</heading>This report has investigated an I beam section subjected to pure torsional loads and compared three methods for estimating the performance of the beam. The results obtained showed that assumptions made in the theoretical calculations greatly affect the results compared to actual beams assumed to be operating under the same conditions. When using theoretical calculations to determine the stresses in an I beam section subjected to pure torsional load it is important to account for the assumptions made by the theory. The results have shown that Saint-Venants principle when applied to the beam used for this investigation proved incorrect, and results obtained through theoretical calculations were lower that those found experimentally and through the use of FEA. The theoretical calculations assume that warping in the section occurs, where as the method used to apply torsional load in the experimental lab prevented warping. The FE results which were initially modelled on the experimental results showed good accuracy to the experimental results. Reconfiguring the FE model to closer resemble beam conditions assumed by the theoretical calculations yielded results in closer agreement with the theoretical calculations. The effects of warping in the beam due to a pure torsional load has been shown to effect the stresses in the beam considerably. The theoretical calculations and revised FE model restraints produced yield loads which were almost half of those found by experimental and initial FE results. Therefore when designing non-circular sections in situations that may subject the section to torsional loads, it is important to take into account the end constraints imposed on to the section in order to accurately predict the stresses under operational conditions.
