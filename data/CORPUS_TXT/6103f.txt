<heading>Objective</heading>To employ the Charpy Impact Test to notched specimens in order to measure the toughness of steels of different carbon compositions and their ductile to brittle transition behavior as a function of temperature. The investigation will analyse the effects of temperature, carbon content and heat treatment on the toughness of the steel. <heading>Experiment</heading>The following experiments were undertaken: <list>Test on similar samples on normalized EN6A (0.4% C) at temperatures above and below room temperature, including room temperature (recorded as 20C)Test on normalized EN1A (0.1% C) for comparison with higher carbon steel EN6A, both at room temperature.Test on samples of EN6A bearing different heat treatments; tempering range 200-600C.</list><figure/><picture/><heading>Results: Test 1 & 2</heading><figure/><table/><figure/><heading>Discussion 1</heading>It can be seen that for the high carbon steel there is an increase in fracture energy in proportion to increase of temperature. However, the impact energies are relatively low and characteristic of brittle failure. Theoretically, there is an increase of plastic deformation during failure which should cause increased fracture energies at higher temperatures. But this does not seem to be the case for the give data. Following the transition point, at approximately 20C, the gradient of the curve is therefore expected to be higher than obtained(?). In contrast, the lower carbon steel appears to demonstrate an increase in fracture energy with temperature. These energies are evidently higher than for the corresponding high carbon steel values. At room temperature (recorded as 20C) the low carbon steel is therefore much tougher than the high carbon steel, as would be expected. <heading>Results: Test 3</heading><figure/><heading>Discussion 2</heading><table/><figure/>In relation to the general trend it can be seen that the results obtained for this experiment do not fit the trend perfectly. That is, the curve is out of shape. There seem to be two possible problems with the data; either that the impact energy is quite low for the tempering range 300-600C (although the behavior of the material in this range has the correct tendency), or that it is quite high for tempering at 200C. Although the specimen notch sizes were consistent throughout the experiment, the results are out of trend, due to two possible factors. The first of these relate to the material used; it is possible that the wrong material was tested on a number of occasions. This was very likely the case with the 500C test which was repeated several times yielding much higher as well as much lower impact energy values than expected. The value finally settled at (52 ft/p) is itself also quite low. The second possibility is that some specimens were not heat treated properly, thus affecting the toughness of the steel and the corresponding impact energy values. The crystallinity values on the other hand are almost reasonable. The variation shows that crystallinity is inversely proportional to temperature. This is the expected result since as the material becomes more ductile with temperature, crystallinity, which is a characteristic of brittleness is lost as the microstructure becomes increasingly fibrous. Crystallinity profiles for 3 different temperatures were obtained and these demonstrate the reduction in crystallinity with higher tempering temperatures. In the final case there is almost zero crystallinity as the material is highly ductile, preventing total fracture due to the materials increased capacity to absorb impact energy - high toughness. T200 has the lowest toughness while T600 has the highest. <figure/><figure/><picture/><heading>Effects of Carbon on Toughness</heading>Carbon and manganese have the largest affects on the transition (of ductile to brittle) temperature. An increase in carbon increases the transition temperature, shifting the relevant part of the curve to the right side of the graph. As a result of this, the brittle range for the steel increases whilst ductility range is decreased. The implication of this is that it affects the maximum impact energy the steel is able to withstand, thus the toughness. <heading>Transformation Products in Steels</heading>Different types of steels vary in toughness, ranging from high toughness at all temperatures for austenitic steels to relatively brittle behaviour of martensitic steels. The toughness depends on the temperature and improves with increased temperatures. The diagram below shows that there is an important difference at low temperatures between austenitic steels on the one hand and martensitic and ferritic steels on the other. Martensitic, ferritic and ferritic-austenitic steels are characterised by a transition in toughness, from tough to brittle behaviour, at the transition temperature. For ferritic steel the transition temperature increases (with increasing carbon) where the steel becomes brittle at successively higher temperatures. For the ferritic-austenitic steels, there is a higher transition temperature as a result of the increased ferrite content (i.e. more brittle behaviour). It can be seen that austenitic steel do not exhibit a toughness transition as with the other steel types, but have high toughness at all temperatures, although it slightly decreases with lowering of temperature. <figure/><heading>Conclusion </heading>The following points can be deduced from the investigation on steels using charpy impact testing: 1) Tough materials absorb a lot of energy when fractured while brittle materials absorb very little energy. 2) Increasing the carbon content decreases the ductility, and therefore embrittles the steel, decreases the charpy impact energy. 3) The energy absorbed in the impact test of an alloy steel at a given test temperature in general increases with increasing tempering temperature. 4) The ductile to brittle transition curve allows us to know the effect of temperature on the fracture energy. The impact energy generally decreases with decreasing temperature as the yield strength increases and the ductility decreases. 5) If the steel has a sharp ductile to brittle transition then a transition temperature can be defined below which the material has poor toughness. 6) The charpy impact test can be used to analyse the relative toughness of different materials to aid the designer in the selection of materials.
