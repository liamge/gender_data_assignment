<heading>Referral information Source of referral and a summary of key information</heading>Mrs  was referred to orthopaedic services by her GP, due to tingling pains and numbness in both hands; she was seen in the outpatient department at the  Hospital in  and had her surgical day unit operation under local anaesthetic on . <heading>History All relevant information gathered from the patient about the presenting illness, co-existing problems, current treatment, significant past medical history and the social and family background. The patient's view of the nature of the problem and their expectations for treatment. </heading><heading>Presenting complaint:</heading>Tingling pains and numbness in both her hands. Her right hand being more troublesome <heading>History of presenting complaint:</heading>Mrs  has been suffering with symptoms bilaterally, although worse in her right hand for over 6 months. These have gradually been increasing in severity, forcing her to consult her GP, two months ago. Mrs  describes the pain as: Located across the medial surfaces of the palmer surfaces of both hands Feels like pins and needles and is sometimes 'burning' in nature She describes it as 'niggling pain' and rates it as 5/10 in severity The pain is not constant, but present up to 10 - 15 times/day, it is nearly always present at night and disturbs her sleep It is not aggravated by anything in particular, but some relief can be gained by hanging the arm over the side of the bed The pins and needles in Mrs 's hands are accompanied by: <list>Loss of grip power causing her to drop thingsLoss of dexterity making it harder for her to do up her buttons on clothingLoss of sensation across both of her index fingers (right worse than her left)</list><heading>Past medical history:</heading>No major illnesses or operations No history of MI, CVA, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidsim, gout or rheumatoid arthritis <heading>Family history:</heading>Nil of note <heading>Drug history and allergies:</heading>Mrs  does not take any regular medications and takes glucosamine over-the-counter tablets NKDA <heading>Social history:</heading>Mrs  is a part-time receptionist and is finding these current symptoms are impinging on her work. She is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol Mrs  lives with her husband and has two grown up children. <heading>Systems review:</heading>A systems review revealed nothing of note. <heading>Analysis of history The most likely single cause of the presentation, other possible causes and reasons for these choices. The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>Mrs 's story is classical of carpal tunnel syndrome, the features of which are as follows: <list>Pain and parasthesia in the distribution of the median nerve in the hand. (See commentary)Pain being burning or tingling in qualityPain waking the patient at nightRelief of symptoms by hanging the arm over the bed or shaking the handClumsiness and weakness with tasks requiring fine manipulation [1]</list>Mrs  presents with all of these features, they arise because there is very little extra space in the carpal tunnel. Once it is occupied, by the flexor tendons and median nerve any swelling of that tunnel results in compression and ischaemia of the nerve causing the above symptoms. To confirm the diagnosis a clinical examination of the hand will be performed, including the special tests for carpal tunnel syndrome. <heading>Physical examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading>Mrs  was sitting comfortably in the chair a full general examination was not performed. <heading>Examination of the Hand</heading><heading>Look:</heading>No palmar erythema, muscle atrophy, rashes or scars. There was no obvious swellings or deformity. <heading>Feel:</heading>No tenderness on palpation Reduced sensation across the left index finger bilaterally. <heading>Move:</heading>No limitation to any hand or thumb movements Grip strength weakened bilaterally <heading>Specific carpal tunnel tests:</heading>Phalen's Test - Positive bilaterally Tinel's Test - Negative bilaterally Direct Pressure Test - Positive bilaterally Test of abductor pollicus brevis - Slightly weakened bilaterally, slightly worse on the right <heading>Analysis of history and examination Reasons for your choice of the cause of the patient's problem(s) and any other cause that still needs to be considered at this stage</heading>The examination of Mrs 's hands has strongly indicated that she has bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Three of the four specific carpal tunnel tests were positive, indicating median nerve compression. In addition, she demonstrated numbness across the index finger, which is supplied by the median nerve (sensory), and reduced grip strength bilaterally worse on the right than the left. The specific carpal tunnel tests are designed to reproduce the symptoms the patient experiences, as all of them compress the carpal tunnel space. Phalen's test involves flexing the wrist for up to 3 minutes, and is positive if symptoms occur. Tinel's test is less reliable than phalens and involves tapping over the flexor retinaculum to aggravate the median nerve and reproduce symptoms. The direct pressure test involves pressing directly over the flexor retinaculum to reproduce symptoms. Mrs  had slightly weakened abductor pollicis brevis muscles in both hands, the median nerve supplies this muscle and so a weakness in this muscle indicates median nerve compression. Although Mrs 's symptoms and examination strongly indicate carpal tunnel syndrome cervical spondylosis may produce similar symptoms and confuse the diagnosis. It is therefore necessary to perform an examination of the cervical spine. Mrs  had normal cervical spine movements. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading>Mrs  is a 58 year old female, who presents with a twelve-month history of bilateral pain and parasthesia in her hands. Her symptoms and examination findings are classical of carpal tunnel syndrome. It is important that she receive treatment for this as it is affecting her job and ability to perform every day tasks. If the carpal tunnel is not decompressed the median nerve can be affected further and muscle atrophy of the hypothenar eminence can occur and later carpal tunnel decompression will not always successfully fully reverse the sensory and motor losses. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management. Refer to the guidelines to the writing of portfolio cases for the details of the issues to be addressed under each heading.</heading><heading>Investigations:</heading><heading>Electrodiagnostic tests</heading>These are used to scientifically confirm the diagnosis by showing the slowing of nerve conduction between the forearm and fingers. This test is nearly always performed before surgery. If there is a query about whether cervical spondylosis is the cause of the symptoms, then an X-ray of the cervical spine should be obtained. <heading>Reassurance and explanation:</heading>The symptoms she was experiencing were explained to her, in terms of the anatomy of the hand and reasons for her symptoms. She was told that there were a few options available to her, with surgery being the gold standard treatment and only one that gives long-term resolution. She was told that the operation was a routine one that can be carried out as a day case under local anaesthetic. The complications were discussed, which include; infection; accidental injury to the palmer cutaneuous branch of the median nerve and thenar motor branches of the median nerve, which may leave the patient with some superficial numbness over the palm of the hand and weakness of thumb movements; and finally incomplete cure of her current symptoms. <heading>Prescription/medical intervention</heading>The following options are available for managing carpal tunnel syndrome: Light wrist splints - these can limit flexion and provide temporary relief of symptoms particularly at night, and can be useful during pregnancy. Corticosteroid injections into the carpal canal - this provides effective but only temporary relief of symptoms, which inevitably return. However if the symptoms are mild or the patient is unfit for surgery, it can be useful. Surgical carpal tunnel release is the gold standard treatment - this involves dividing the transverse carpal ligaments to relieve the pressure on the median nerve. It is a relatively quick and simple operation and can be performed either endoscopically or by open surgery. <heading>Observation</heading>The procedure was carried out as a day case; observation of post-operative recovery and rehabilitation with the physiotherapists should be carried out with a follow-up out-patient appointment. <heading>Referral and team work:</heading>Mrs  should be referred to the physiotherapy department for post-operative rehabilitation. They will gradually increase movement of the hand with structured exercises. <heading>Advice and prevention:</heading>Carpal tunnel syndrome is more common during the menopause, in rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy and myxoedema. It is not possible to predict exactly who will suffer with the condition or prevent the condition from occurring. <heading>Outcome A description of the progress of the patient as far as possible. This should include consideration of further issues to be resolved. Where appropriate you should contact by telephone patients who have been discharged home.</heading>Mrs  came to clinic on  post right carpal tunnel decompression. She was very happy with the results and wished to be placed on the surgical day unit list for decompression of her left carpal tunnel in the near future. <heading>Evidence based care and issues for research A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s)</heading>Evidence-based studies looking at whether surgical or non-surgical treatments offer the most effective symptom relief. <heading>Efficacy of corticosteroid injection:</heading>A systematic review looked at the clinical improvement of symptoms with local steroid injection, placebo injection or other non-surgical interventions. The results suggest that local corticosteroid injection provides clinical improvement in symptoms at one-month post injection compared to placebo. However continued symptom relief could not be demonstrated after one month [2]. This study would indicate that steroid injections have a place as a temporary solution, when surgery is not indicated, i.e. pregnancy. It may also have a place for mild symptoms that do not warrant immediate surgery. <heading>Surgical treatment versus non- treatment :</heading>One RCT compared the effectiveness of surgical release of the carpal tunnel and non-surgical splinting of the wrist, for clinical improvement. The results showed that at three month follow up, 71% of patients receiving surgery had a significant treatment success, compared with 51.6% who underwent splinting. As well as being more effective at three months, the patients who underwent surgery had a much lower risk of needing re-operation, unlike the majority of the non-surgical patients who needed surgery at a later date [3]. This study highlights that although splints may provide some relief, particularly for mild symptoms; in the long-run surgery is the definitive treatment to achieve significant clinical improvement. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compressive neuropathy in the upper limb. Lifetime incidence is 6% in women and 0.6% in men. It is most common between the ages of 40 - 60 years [4]. The carpal tunnel is a narrow fibro-osseous canal, rigidly bound by the carpal bones and roofed by the transverse carpal ligament. It contains the median nerve and the nine extrinsic flexors of the fingers and thumb with their synovial sheath [5]. <list><heading>Causes of carpal tunnel syndrome</heading>PregnancyRheumatoid arthritisArthritis (degenerative)Growth hormone abnormalities (acromegaly)Metabolic (hypothyroidism, gout, diabetes mellitus)AlcoholismTumoursIdiopathicConnective tissue disorders (amyloidosis) [5]</list><list><heading>Supply of median nerve in the hand</heading>-Sensory innervation of the thumb, and fingers except the last 1½ digits.
