By 1977, experiments conducted by Berg et al. demonstrated that bacterial flagellar rotation is powered by a proton gradient (Manson et al., 1977), and this was followed by researchers assaying for rotation in ATP synthase. After numerous experiments, it is now known that ATP synthase is the key enzyme involved in ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate, using the proton motive force. The enzyme is a membrane bound protein, and is found in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes, the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts in plants and in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes. The overall molecular mass of the complex is 520kDa (Capaldi et al. 1999) and it is though to be the world's smallest rotary engine. (Wang et al., 1998). It also has an extremely high mechanical efficiency, calculated by taking the ration of the average viscous dissipation per step to the free energy of hydrolysis, of almost 100%. Wang et al. explain that "this high efficiency is possible because the motor is not a heat engine, but is driven almost completely by elastic strain energy." ATP synthase is also often called ATPase, which is because it was discovered through the catalysis of ATP hydrolysis. This is the reaction for which most experimental data has been obtained (Weber et al., 2000). The reason behind this because the synthesis of ATP is more difficult to study as a proton gradient is necessary. Hence much of the evidence behind the structure and mechanism of the F 1F O type ATP synthase will be based on its catalysis of ATP hydrolysis. However, a novel experiment (Itoh et al., 2004) using electrical magnets to move the γ subunit via an attached magnetic bead resulted in the appearance of ATP in the medium. This experiment provided direct evidence for the synthesis of ATP driven by mechanical energy. The structure and mechanisms put forward that are discussed in this essay are all supported by various experiments involving a range of different techniques, such as genetic study, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, X-ray analysis, electron microscopy, video fluorescence microscopy, studies of mutants and chemical cross linking among others. <heading>F1 AND FO PARTS</heading>The F 1F O type ATP synthase, as its name suggests, has a F 1 and F O part. Based on the knowledge of Escherichia coli F 1F O structure, the soluble F 1 part is made up of α3, β3, γ, δ, and ε. The F O part, which is embedded in the membrane, consists of a, b2 and cn subunits. The c subunits form a circular complex that makes part of the rotor, details of which will be considered later in this essay. The α and β subunits of the F1 part also form a complex and are arranged alternately in a hexameric ring. The symmetry of this structure is broken down by the central stalk made of γ and ε subunits. This stalk is one of the two stalks that join the F1 and FO parts. The second is a peripheral one that involves subunits δ and b2. (Capaldi et al, 2002) The diagram overleaf (Fig. 1) shows the general structure of the F1FO type ATP synthase as described. <fnote>The number of c subunits is unclear. See section THE FO DOMAIN - LESS CLEAR... </fnote>These two parts, the F 1 and F O, have been separated (a process also known as uncoupling) and it was discovered that the parts can work in isolation of each other. F 1 could work as an ATPase and F O could function as a proton pump. However, ATP formed in the catalytic site of F 1 could only be released with proton flow though the F O part, and the proton translocation in isolated F O was passive and bidirectional. (Capaldi et al., 2002) Once the general function of the F 1 and F O was established, the next question was which subunits of each part were involved in the reactions. <picture/><heading>THE F1 DOMAIN CONTAINS THREE CATALYTIC SITES</heading>X-ray crystallographic studies by John Walker et al. (Abrahams et al., 1994) revealed that F 1 contains three catalytic sites, one on each β subunit. Addition of excess ATP lead to the binding of ATP in all three sites, with lower affinity binding at the second and third sites. Although the affinities for the substrates were lower for the other two sites, enzyme activity, however, increased. That is, in the words of Capaldi et al., the enzyme "displays a strong negative cooperativity of substrate binding and at the same time a strong positive cooperativity of enzymatic activity." This unusual property was explained by a hypothesis proposed by Boyer, namely the "binding charge" or "alternating site" hypothesis. Essentially, Boyer suggested that each of the three catalytic sites are in different conformation at any one time. One is open and ready for ATP (or ADP+P i) binding, the second is partly open and the third is closed around the bound nucleotide. Boyer proposed that ATP binding would result in the closure of the open site and cause a cooperative conformational change, inducing the other two sites to change - the closed site to partly open and the party open site to open completely. In this way, each site would alternate between three states as ATP hydrolysis progresses (or in the reverse direction if ATP synthesis is considered) This was an insightful proposal by Boyer, but the problem still remained on how these conformation changes could be propagated between the three catalytic sites and in what manner these events were coupled to proton translocation. Again it was Boyer that suggested that both could occur by the rotation of one or more subunits in the F 1. It is now known that it is in fact the γ and ε subunits that provide the rotor and the c subunit ring rotates against a and b subunits during proton translocation. Further details on the mechanism of the rotation will be covered in a later section. <heading>THE FO DOMAIN - LESS CLEAR... </heading>In contrast to the detailed structural model that has been established for the F 1 domain of ATP synthase, much less is known about the F O part. The reasons described by Stock et al. are that the c subunit shows no interpretable side chain density and in addition, the density could not be improved by modelling the subunits as polyalanine or by averaging. As a consequence, it has not been possible to build a clear atomic model of this portion of ATP synthase. Nevertheless, the electron densities of the c subunits do show that they consist of two α helices linked by a loop (Stock et al., 1999) and it is thought that there are number of c subunits forming a circular complex. However, the exact number of c subunits is unclear, and the number may depend on species. In their 1999 review, Stock et al. explain that the number of c subunits in the ring has an implication for the number of protons translocated by F O for each ATP molecule synthesised. Therefore, the number of c subunits of 9 or 12 was considered to require translocation of three or four protons per ATP synthesised to bring about a 120° rotation to the c ring. "A ring with 10 c subunits in it suggests that the H+/ATP ratio is probably nonintegral and that its value lie between three and four. Many of the experimentally measured H+/ATP ratio lies in this range". (Stock et al., 1999) However, the number of c subunits in the ring complex is still a disputed topic. <heading>BINDING</heading>Originally, three different catalytic site conformations were proposed (open, loose, tight), as shown in Fig. 2 overleaf. However, now with recent data, this explanation is thought to be confusing and insufficient. Weber et al. argue that it is better to designate the binding sites as: H highest affinity, M medium affinity and L lowest affinity; and that the open site (O) is a different conformation all together and is always unoccupied. This alternate mechanism will be discussed subsequently. <figure/>Although Fig. 2 shows ADP and P i binding to the O site, experimental evidence (Zhou et al., 1992) has determined that it is in fact MgADP and free P i that are the forms that bind to the enzyme. Hence, the amount of free Mg 2+, as well as ATP, are important parameters that will affect the rate of reaction. <heading>ROTATION OF THE ENZYME</heading>The rotor part of the ATP synthase is: cnγε, which can be seen in Fig. 2. Cross linking studies show that joining the c and γ does not impair the ATPase activity of F OF 1. (Watts et al., 1996) In fact, the γ rotates with the c ring due to an apparent permanent binding between the γ and ε subunits and a set of c subunits in the circular complex. (Tsunoda et al., 2001) The remaining subunits of the enzyme forms the static part of the enzyme called the stator. The stator must be strong enough to resist the rotor torque (Weber et al., 2003) to ensure that the subunits a and α3β3 do not rotate with c nγε. According to studies by Elston et al., when the rotor rotates by 120°, four protons are translocated across the membrane, which accounts for enough energy to convert ADP and inorganic phosphate into ATP. The actual rotation of the γ subunit was elegantly confirmed by Noji et al. through an experiment using a fluorescent actin attached to the γ shaft, while the α3β3 subunits were fixed onto a Ni 2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) coated glass surface. (shown in Fig. 3) <figure/>Under a fluorescent microscope, the anticlockwise rotation of the actin filament in 120° steps was observed (Fig. 4, overleaf) while ATP was hydrolysed. <picture/>Later experiments replaced the actin filaments with gold beads of 40nm diameter, producing less drag compared to the actin filament and allowed an advance in the time resolution. (as explained by Weber et al., 2003) Other experiments (by Tsunoda et al., 2000 among others) involved the extension of the procedure to detergent-solubilised F 1F O or membrane fragments and used a highly specific, engineered attachment site for the actin filament, confirming the rotation of the c ring complex together with the γ and ε subunits. For example, Stock et al. demonstrated that the c subunit has two α helices linked by a loop and that six to seven of these interhelical loops are in close contact with the γ subunit of the central stalk. The extensive contact between the c ring and stalk supports the hypothesis that they rotate together during catalysis. However, to build a clearer model of the generation of rotation, it was necessary to establish the interaction between the c subunit and the remaining subunits of the F O domain. A recent experiment by Itoh et al. presents direct evidence for the synthesis of ATP driven by mechanical energy. Their experiment involved attaching a magnetic bead to the γ subunit of the isolated F 1 on a glass surface, and rotating the bead using electrical magnets. Rotation the magnet and hence the γ subunit in the appropriate direction in a medium containing ADP and phosphate as substrates resulted in the emergence of ATP in the medium. <heading>MECHANISM OF ROTATION</heading>The rotation of the c nγε subunits of ATP synthase has a very high mechanical efficiency. As mentioned earlier, it is almost 100% efficient. This was the basis for the idea of elastic power transmission. Essentially, the proposal is that the "energy can be stored during the rotational step by protein conformational torsion, then released smoothly to be translated into ligand binding affinity changes." (Weber et al., 2003). It is thought that the flexibility of the b subunit, unwinding of γ and conformational transitions within β provides the physical basis for the storage of elastic energy. An experiment conducted by Rastogi et al. demonstrated that once Asp61 is protonated, the c subunit undergoes a significant rotation of its C terminal helix. "It was proposed that this rotation couples the protonation and deportonation reaction to angular displacement of c versus a, resulting in net proton-driven c ring rotation". (Weber et al., 2003) Further studies involving mutations in the c subunit and cross linking off c to a revealed that the "swivelling" of the c and a helices in relation to one another is integral to the generation of the rotation of the c ring complex. The general agreement is that each of the c subunits in the circular complex carries a proton as it rotates and the deprotonated c subunits only occur at the interface of a and c. The interaction of between the c subunit and the proton is thought to have a property like an electrostatic carrier mechanism. Recent studies, according to Fillingame et al. show that in Escherichia coli, there are 10 c subunits, and each has one essential amino acid that binds to a proton. In the case of the E. coli ATP synthase, this is Asp61. Moreover, subunit a of the F O sector is thought to provide proton access channels to and from this Asp61. Another important amino acid residue is one on the a subunit, the Arg210. This is thought to lower the pKa of the c subunit Asp61, which is necessary to allow the binding of a proton to Asp61. From this, it can be deduced that if the c ring must turn or swivel to allow interaction of Asp61 with this Arg210, the ionisation and proton release of Asp61 can be controlled in this manner. This would be in agreement with the proposal by Weber et al. that each subunit in c-ring complex carries a proton as it rotates and that deprotonation and protonation only occurs at the a-c interface. Earlier in the essay, it was suggested that Boyer's binding charge hypothesis is ambiguous and not directly supported by the experimental evidence. Weber et al. suggest a different enzymatic mechanisms for ATP hydrolysis and synthesis, as shown overleaf in Fig. 5. <figure/>Weber et al. argue that evidence now supports this trisite mechanism because molecules with two sites filled show negligible activity and writing a bisite mechanism poses problems. "A corollary is that only a molecule with all three sites filled can rotate. This emphasises a major point, that the F 1 functions obligatorily as a three-cylinder engine." Hence they explain that two sites are not enough and that only when the third catalytic site is occupied the conformational changes occur. <heading>CONCLUSION</heading>After decades of research on ATP synthase, a clearer picture of its structure has been developed and with it the understanding of its mechanism has matured. However, there are still areas that need to be studied in more detail. For example, mechanism of transport through F O still needs clarification. There is also a need for a more detailed structures of this part, as the lack of high resolution structure of subunit a and the a-c interface impedes the progress to finding the exact access channels which are needed to allow protons to move from the membrane surface to the specific amino acid residues. <quote>"...the ATP synthase field has expanded into "mechanoenzymology", encompassing not only enzymology and membrane transport, but also engineering and nanotechnology. It represents virgin territory for physicists, biophysicists, biochemical engineers, membrane transport researchers and enzymologists to collaborate in understanding two of biology's fundamental processes."
