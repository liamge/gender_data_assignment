<heading>Aim:</heading>To separate the components of a simulated pharmaceutical preparation. <heading>Theory:</heading>Most commercial preparations are mixtures of many different substances. To obtain a pure organic compound from such a mixture, one must separate the wanted compounds from other components by using the differences in physical and chemical properties. Organic materials Tends to have very different solubility's in differing organic solvents and can often be separated by filtration/extraction. Organic compounds with functional groups such as amino and carboxylic acid can be converted to their water soluble salts, which can then be separated from insoluble components of a mixture, these salts can then be converted back to an organic soluble material and recovered. <heading>Reaction equation:</heading> FORMULA  <heading>Saftey/Hazards:</heading><list>Pharmaceutical preparation (hazards unknown)Ethyl Acetate (highly flammable)Sodium Hydroxide (2M) (corrosive)Hydrochloric acid (2M) (corrosive)Ethanol (Flammable, toxic)</list>Precautions to be taken, appropriate lab wear to be worn including lab coats, goggles, gloves and hair to be tied back. All work is to be carried out in a fume hood. <heading>Experimental method:</heading>To begin the sample of pharmaceutical preparation - sample A (4g) was placed in a conical flask (100ml) with ethyl acetate (50ml) and swirled thoroughly; a semi-cloudy solution was formed. The insoluble material was followingly filtered at the pump; left to dry, weighed (2.93g) and its melting point taken. The filtrate was transferred to a separatory funnel and 2M Sodium hydroxide (25ml) was added. The funnel was stoppered and shaken frequently opening to release any pressure. The two layers were then allowed to separate and the aqueous layer was run off. This process was the repeated with a further portion of 2m Sodium hydroxide (25ml) and the two aqueous layers combined. Aqueous 6M hydrochloric acid (20ml) was added slowly, whilst shaking to the combined aqueous layers. The solution warmed and a white precipitate was formed. The Ph of the solution was taken with indication paper (PH1) to check the Ph was below 2. The mixture was then cooled on ice and the precipitate collected by vacuum filtration. The filtrate was washed with distilled water, and the solid left to dry under suction for 10 minutes. The weight of the crude sample was taken (1.4g) and followingly it was recrystallised from ethanol. The purified product was weighed (0.93g) and a melting point and Ir spectrum taken. Magnesium Sulphate was added to the ethyl acetate (remaining) layer and swirled creating a "snowstorm", This was then filtered at the pump into a pre-weighed round bottomed flask (100ml) washing with ethyl acetate. Following this the solvent was evaporated on the rotary evaporator. Mass of the crude solid was taken (0.8g) and then recrystalised from ethanol/water mix (ethanol added under heat until product dissolved, water added until solution went cloudy, ethanol added to clear solution). Finally weight of the purified product was taken (0.77g) and a melting point and IR spectrum recorded. <heading>Results:</heading><table/><table/><figure/>From these spectrums we can check the identity of our final products. Both spectrums clearly show the carbonyl group (C=O). In addition the spectrum of Aspirin shows peaks representative of O-H (3020cm -1) and C-O (1216cm -1). Acetanilide also shows a peak of 3296cm -1; representative of a N-H bond. These spectrums clearly support the presence of our product. <heading>Discussion:</heading><figure/><figure/><figure/>The sodium salt is much more soluble in water than the organic solvent. Hence the compound will be found in the aqueous layer. By addition of HCL; the organic acid is re-created; and being far less soluble in water it precipitates out of solution.
