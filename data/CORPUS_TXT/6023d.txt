<heading>Introduction</heading>The initial recognition and identification of microorganisms in food is a useful skill. Many of us can naturally usually tell when spoilage has occurred in some foods however identifying the actual microorganism or the extent of its proliferation in a food is another matter . The recognition of microorganisms then allows one to trace back the most likely sources of contamination or causes of excessive proliferation and take steps to avoid these in future . <heading>Materials</heading><list>Pasteurised skimmed milk - stored at 20Â°C for 48 hours Yoghurt ( not pasteurised , low fat) - believed normalPorridge oats pH papers ,2-4, 4-6,6-8sellotape , fungal mounting fluidlow power binocular microscopedichloran rose Bengal chloramphenicol agar</list><heading>Procedure</heading>A visual observation of the samples was undertaken. The liquid samples were smelled to see if any off notes could be detected . The pH of the milk and the yoghurt was measured by dipping the appropriate pH paper directly into the sample , this was then discarded ad microbiological waste - in case it was contaminated . A small amount of the oats porridge was mixed with purified water in a beaker A microscopic observation of each of the foods was then undertaken . <heading>Microscopic examination of the foods </heading><heading>Yoghurt and milk samples</heading>A small amount was put on the slide using an inoculating loop Liquid allowed to dry at room temperature before being passed briefly through the top of a Bunsen flame to fix the stain and kill the bacteria. This was then stained with 'crystal violet for one minute which was then rinsed off under running water . The slides were observed under the 100X objective oil immersion lens <heading>Oats porridge</heading>An unstained 'wet mount' using adhesive tape was created to observe the oats under the microscope as initial observations indicated mould growth was occurring . A drop of mounting fluid was place onto a slide A piece of transparent adhesive tape ( 8cm long, 2 cm wide ) was wrapped round two fingers and sticky side lightly touched on the surface of the oats porridge Inoculated region of the tape was placed on drop of mounting fluid and stuck to the ends of the slide Slide observed under X10 and X40 objectives The structures observed were drawn ( see below) <heading>OBSERVATIONS </heading>In the milk sample , no bacteria was observed . <heading>Questions </heading><heading>Explain how foods might acquire the following smells or flavours due to microbial action </heading>Rancid : This occurs when fat or fat in food goes bad . This is due to bacterial action on fats which breaks down the fat into fatty acids and glycerol which give off the rancid smell. Alcoholic : This is due to a fermentation process which normally occurs or is carried out by anaerobic bacteria . The reaction is as follows the sugars in the fruit juice or food are broken down by yeast producing carbondioxide and water . This process is essential in the brewing industry . Sour : This for example occurs in milk , occurs when carbohydrates in the food e.g. in milk lactose is broken down by lactic acid bacteria and this results in compounds which have a sour taste and foul smell . Putrid : This is a 'rotten or garbage like ' smell and results from the breakdown of proteins in foods by bacteria which produces compounds such as Hydrogen sulphide or ammonia compounds and one or a combination of this results in a putrid smell <heading>List the pH values of the milk and yoghurt samples and explain why they are not identical </heading>Milk had a pH of 4.0 this is quite acidic as milk typically has a ph value of 6.4 -6.6 <fnote>Moss A., Adams M Food Microbiology , 2nd Edition 2000 p123 </fnote>Yoghurt in this experiment had a pH 6.0. This was somewhat higher (more basic ) than the typical value of yoghurt . (usually 3.8-4.2) . To form yoghurt a pH of 4.6-4.7. must be achieved as this is the isoelectric point of casein . <fnote>Mos A , Adams M Food Microbiologuy, 2nd Edition 2000 p 327 </fnote>The values for milk and yoghurt are not identical firstly because the two substances have different chemical properties to begin with, yoghurt is a product of the fermentation of milk . Secondly, they have undergone some spoilage as they're pH values are not in the typical range . <heading>Why , in Breeds smear method , are the microscopial and viable counts of a sample likely to be similar if each chain or clump of bacteria is counted as a single organism , whereas the counts may differ if every individual organism is counted in the Breed's smear. </heading>This is because of the assumption that upon successful dilution of a culture medium on a nutrient plate individual cells will be deposited and these when adequately incubated will go on to multiply . Hence each colony or group of cells is a result of a single cell. However not all cells may multiply giving rise to colonies which may give the impression of fewer cells to start of with . However, if each individual cell is counted , there would be no need to take that assumption . <heading>Discussion and Conclusion </heading>In the milk sample , despite the fact that the milk had an unusual smell and was overly acidic no bacteria were observed under the microscope. This demonstrates the importance of carrying out more than one test. The previous two tests definitely indicated spoilage but the extent or type of microorganism was not identified . In an industry setting , a repeat of this stage would be necessary For the yoghurt and porridge oats the microorganisms present were clearly visible and identifiable. This shows that simple rapid techniques are effective for identifying microorganisms in foods.
