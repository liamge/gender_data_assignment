<heading>Objective</heading>This experiment aims to study the mechanical properties of steel and aluminium alloys when subjected to appropriate heat treatment processes. <heading>Experiments</heading><heading>Experiment 1:</heading>Three steel (EN24) specimens (see appendix for composition) are austenitized at 850C for two-hours then oil quenched and Rockwell C Hardness measured. The three samples are then tempered at 650°C, 520°C and 270°C for two-hours, following which RC hardness is again measured. <heading>Experiment 2:</heading>Test 1: Eight aluminium alloy samples (see appendix for composition) are solution treated at 520°C for 48 hours then water quenched and Brinell Hardness measured for each (Test 1) Test 2: Two specimens are retained, Sample 1 and 2, and labeled Room Temperature and Freezer respectively. Samples 1 is allowed to "naturally harden" at constant precipitation (ambient) temperature while Sample 2 is placed in a freezer and is removed only for hardness testing then replaced, also at constant precipitation temperature. These samples are tested for hardness 2x and 1x during the first day of the experiment, respectively, then again on a daily basis for a period of 6 days (excluding weekend). Test 3: The remaining 6 samples (3-8) are placed in an oven at 270°C for tempering. The samples are removed at the following times consecutively and hardness values measured: <table/><heading>Results 1</heading><table/><figure/><heading>Discussion 1</heading>As expected, the variation shows that Rockwell Hardness drops as tempering temperature rises. The RC is initially highest at a tempering temperature of 270°C and can generally be seen to be inversely proportional to the tempering. At a tempering temperature of 650°C hardness was recorded as negative (-2). This is due to the oven operating at a higher temperature of 680°C. The variation indicates two distinct regions. Region 1 spans the tempering range 270-520°C. In this region, between approximate tempering range 270-400°C, the transformation is slowest where martensite changes to some extent to form a black constituent. This structure is not like banite but is granular in structure and is a composition of very fine ferrite and cementite. The structure is much tougher albeit softer than martensite and the process can be said to exchange brittleness for toughness, thereby increasing the strength of the steel. Tempering above 400°C causes cementite particles to combine and produce a structure (sorbite) that is weaker and softer but more ductile than the previous structure. In Region 2, the relationship between hardness and tempering temperature is steeper as the transformation is more rapid. Here, at a tempering temperature of 520°C, the transformation towards the austenitic region is faster and as a result the strength falls rapidly although with little increase in ductility. <figure/>On a microcosmic level, the tempering provides atoms enough thermal energy that they are able to diffuse out of supersaturated solution to react with iron and form close precipitates of Fe 3C (Fig. 1.1). The lattice forms into a body centered cubic structure of equilibrium at alpha (phase diagram not available) and as a result the ductility increases. <figure/>As a result of quenching and tempering in this way steel improves dramatically in yield and tensile strengths. (Fig.1.2) <heading>Results 2</heading><heading>Results 2.1</heading><table/><figure/><heading>Discussion 2.1</heading>In solution heat treatment, the alloys are heated to a temperature of 520°C in order to dissolve the alloying elements into the solution. Quenching of the metal then rapidly cools the material in order to freeze and retain atoms of the alloying elements in the lattice structure of the aluminium. The rapid cooling process produces a fine structure and because the precipitation is rapid the nucleation rate is high. The resulting precipitates are small and closely packed together and as such limit the movement of dislocations thus hardening the alloy. The two lines (Graph 2.1) show age hardening for a sample that was left to cool slowly at room temperature after quenching, and one sample which was put into a freezer for the time period after the quench. These samples were measured for hardness on a daily basis (six days). At temperatures of 520°C for both samples (before quenching), the composition will consist of alpha (single phase) solid solution only. The quenching process allows the alloy to retain the copper in the solution to produce a 'supersaturated' solution of copper in aluminium. When the quenched alloy is left at room temperature over a long time period the strength and hardness can be seen to gradually increase as a result of natural age hardening, while ductility is decreased. Natural age hardening is a slower process of precipitation (the formation of small particles which hinder movement of dislocations) since it occurs at room temperature and a lower rate of cooling. As a result, increase of hardness over the time period is expected to occur rather slowly. After a period of around 6 days the hardness tends to average out with no further changes to properties occurring. The freezed sample generally exhibits lower hardness. For the first few days it can be seen to have constant hardness and suddenly peaks at 96 hours then drops again. The sudden peak is perhaps attributable to human error in measuring the Brinell Hardness. The tendency of the freezed sample to exhibit lower hardness can be associated with the freezing process which serves to retard the ageing process that is associated with increasing hardness (?). It is also known that a new batch of materials was used in the experiment and that some materials are therefore expected to behave more ductile and softer (?). <heading>Result 2.2</heading><table/><table/><figure/><heading>Discussion 2.2</heading>The graph shows that the maximum hardness under precipitation hardening (artificial ageing) is greater than the maximum hardness achieved under natural hardening. By accelerating the rate of diffusion, this precipitation hardening increases the amount of 'intermediate coherent' precipitate thus raising the strength and hardness of the alloy. As the graph shows, there is usually an optimum point since as the material gets hotter, the grains grow thus increasing ductility and the hardness readings will therefore drop. On the level of the microstructure, this occurs when the composition reaches its saturated normal state, where the material reaches maximum hardness. However, the precipitate continues to grow at the expense of the finer precipitates. As a result of this disappearance of the fine precipitates the strength and the hardness decrease. For this reason perhaps the phenomenon is called "over-ageing". <heading>Conclusion </heading>The following conclusions are reached from this investigation: Alloys are heat-treated in order to vary their mechanical properties. Heat treatment can be applied to steel to harden it as well as to improve its strength, toughness or ductility. Quenching, depending on the cooling rate, aims to avoid the critical cooling rate (C-curve) in order to produce a hard (but brittle) martensitic structure. Fully hardened carbon steel is brittle and the existence of stresses resulting from the quench would especially make it unsuitable for most applications. It is due to this reason that the steel is tempered to release stresses while exchanging brittleness for toughness as hardness drops with tempering temperature. The aluminium alloy derives its strength from solid solution and precipitation hardening. The properties of strength under precipitation hardening were found to improve over those obtained by natural age hardening, when samples were tempered at 270°C for short periods of time.
