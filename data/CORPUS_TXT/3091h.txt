The engine was operated under the conditions shown in Table 3.1. The AVL Indimeter was used to log pressure variation in the cylinder during the combustion process. <table/>For each operating condition, the following parameters were recorded. <list>Brake Power (kw)Torque (Nm)Fuel consumption (g/s)Ignition timing (°BTDC)Cylinder pressure/crank angle (bar/°)</list><heading>Theory</heading><heading>Pressure Crank angle Data</heading>A piezoelectric transducer can be used to measure changed in pressure within the cylinder. The transducer can be mounted within the spark plug and is able to measure the changing pressure within the cylinder during combustion due to its fast response time. Measuring the crank position from a toothed flywheel allows pressure vs. crank angle diagrams to be drawn. <heading>Determining Start and End of Combustion (SOC & EOC)</heading>Using the cylinder pressure vs. crank angle data it is possible to determine the SOC and EOC by plotting a graph using Equation 4.1. Equation 4.1 - Polytropic process PV n = Constant As the piston rises in the cylinder, the volume decrease, and hence the pressure increases. If this process is a polytropic process then plotting PV n produces a constant value, in Graph 5.1. However if the gas being compressed is suddenly ignited as in the cylinder then the pressure no longer rises according to the polytropic process and, hence the gradient changes. The SOC is when the gradient begins to change (around 7°BTDC Graph 5.1) and the EOC is when the gradient flattens (approximately 26°ATDC in Graph 5.1). <heading>Analysis Equations</heading>Equation 4.2 - Indicated Mean Effective Pressure  FORMULA  Equation 4.3 - Thermal Efficiency  FORMULA  Equation 4.4 - Mechanical Efficiency  FORMULA  Equation 4.5 - Co-efficient of Variance  FORMULA  <figure/><heading>Results</heading>All data and relevant plots can be found in Appendix 2, below is a sample of some of the results obtained from testing. <table/><figure/><table/><figure/><figure/>Crank Angle <heading>Discussion</heading><heading>Engine performance analysis</heading>Using the data obtained from the AVL Indimeter, and the equations in Appendix 1 & section 0 it is possible to calculate: <list>Indicated PowerIndicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP)Thermal EfficiencyMechanical Efficiency</list>These results can be seen in Table 5.2, and in Appendix 2. PV diagrams of the data show that higher peak pressures are attained with WOT at higher speeds, this is due to the higher inlet velocity and hence greater turbulence (tumble for high speed engines) in the cylinder, this ensure better mixing of the air/fuel mixture. Also note how ignition timing is varied to ensure peak pressure occurs close to ATDC. The pumping work of the cycle can be seen on the PV diagrams, and is less at higher engine speeds indicated by the increase in mechanical efficiency in Table 5.2. <heading>Ignition Delay & Flame growth</heading>Ignition delay can be defined as the time delay between the spark and the flame nucleus becoming big enough so that the combustion is enhanced by the turbulence within the cylinder. Initially the flame nucleus is small and combustion is laminar, as the nucleus grows the combustion becomes turbulent and flame propagation is enhanced. The ignition delay period is approximately time constant. Ferguson 2001 states that ignition delay (in degrees of crank angle) for an SI engine is in the order of 10° for a rich burn, and 20° for a lean burn case. <enote>FERGUSON. C. R, "Internal Combustion Engines - Applied thermosciencs", 2nd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, 2001, p256 </enote>To ensure homogeneous burning of the air/fuel mixture and therefore good flame growth the induced turbulence & swirl/tumble within the cylinder head is critical. Once combustion starts the flame propagates throughout the mixed gases within the cylinder, typical burn rates for gasoline are 1.4~1.5m/s. <heading>Ignition Timing</heading>Combustion takes a finite time, therefore ignition is advanced to BTDC. This means there is a pressure rise BTDC and the compression work increases (negative work). Higher pressure at TDC leads to higher pressures during expansion and hence an increase in positive work. Therefore there is an optimum ignition timing that is a compromise between these two effects. Plotting ignition timing against torque produces a curve similar to that shown in Figure 6.1. The minimum advance is more critical than maximum advance for max torque and so is generally quoted, this is known as MBT (Minimum advance for Best Torque). By retarding the ignition by a few degrees from maximum torque the nitric oxide emission are greatly reduced, this also reduces the engines octane requirements. <enote>FERGUSON. C. R, "Internal Combustion Engines - Applied thermosciencs", 2nd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, 2001, p336 </enote>At part throttle the combustion rate is slower due to lower intake velocities and reduced turbulence, this leads to partial combustion. Therefore the ignition timing is advanced to ensure complete combustion, ensuring clean emissions. This can be seen for ¼ throttle in Table 5.1. <figure/><heading>Engine Knock</heading>Engine knock occurs due to the air/fuel mixture autoigniting, this autoignition produces shock waves which produced the "knocking" sound. One of the reasons the autoignition temperature is reached is by too high a compression ratio. This limits the thermal efficiency of an IC engine, since thermal efficiency is a function of compression ratio which in turn is limited by autoignition of the air/fuel mixture. Pre-ignition leads to higher peak pressures, and this in turn can cause pre-ignition, Figure 6.2 shows the pressure vs. crank angle graph during knock. Advanced ignition timing also is a cause of engine knock since the heat transfer from the flame front raises the temperature of the unburnt mixture to the point of autoignition. This is more of a problem at lower engine speeds due advanced ignition timing and their being more time for autoignition precursors to form. To prevent knock the ignition timing needs to be retarded, which leads to lower peak pressures. Modern engines use knock sensors which measure the pressure or vibration variations within the cylinder, when knock is detected the ignition is retarded. <figure/><heading>Cyclic Cylinder Pressure Variation</heading>The COV can be calculated using Equation 4.5, and was calculated for the Peak Pressure and IMEP over the 100 cycles that were recorded by the AVL Indimeter for each engine operating condition listed in Table 3.1. The results can be seen in Table 5.1. Graph 5.2 shows the pressure variation between 6 cycles during testing. It can be seen that between these 6 cycles the pressure variation is approximately 4 bar. The cyclic variation in peak pressure or IMEP occurs due to a multitude of reasons, including variation in turbulence in the cylinder, mixing of the gases, air measurement inaccuracies, dynamics waves between cylinders, exhaust gas residues. If the cyclic variation could be removed then performance gains of between 7-10% could be achieved. <enote>STONE R, "Introduction to Internal Combustion Engines", 3rd Edition, Antony Rowe Ltd, 1999, p182 </enote>The COV of the peak pressure is often used as a measure of engines overall performance since it is easy to measure, however IMEP is a better indication of overall engine performance, at sufficiently high levels of COV the driver would become aware of fluctuations in engine output, which is clearly linked to the imep. <enote>FERGUSON.

The Mfb against crank angle determines how energy is released during combustion. A slow burn rate will have a shallow gradient and will burn over a larger crank angle, a fast burn rate will have a steep gradient and a small crank angle. High efficiency can be obtained from a fast burn rate which has a step gradient on the Mfb graph, however to obtain this the inlet velocity needs to be sufficiently high, and the turbulence within the cylinder enough to ensure complete mixing of air/ fuel. Therefore the Mfb is restricted by inlet geometry and combustion chemistry. Graph 5.3 shows the Rassweiler & Withrow method plotted against the Weibe function for 2000 rev/min and 50% throttle. <heading>Rassweiler and Withrow Method</heading>This is a technique for calculating the Mfb developed by Rassweiler and Withrow in 1938. "This method is based on the assumption that, once combustion commences, the change in pressure, ΔP over a crank angle interval, Δθ, is the sum of two parts: the pressure rise due to piston motion, ΔPv, and the pressure rise due to combustion, ΔPc" . <enote>BALL. J, RAINE, STONE. C.R, "Combustion analysis and cycle by cycle variations in spark ignition engine combustions", Proc IMechE, Part D, Vol 212, 1998 </enote><heading>Weibe Function</heading>The Weibe function is a purely mathematical model which can be used to estimate engine performance, such as efficiency & emissions. The model enables the development of combustion chamber, injector design and ignition timing. The Weibe constants, 'a' and 'm' can be varied to match that of a particular engine, but are a=5 and m=2 for a typical SI engine. The effects of varying the Weibe constants can be seen in Figure 6.3, which shows that varying constant 'a' varies the slope, varying 'm' changes the length of burn, and has a greater effect on the Mfb. Plots of the Rassweiler and Withrow method & Weibe function for all engine conditions test can be found in Appendix 2. For low engine speeds and load the burn rate is slow due to reduced intake velocity and cylinder turbulence, values of m and a are higher and lower respectively. At higher engine speeds and loads, burn rate is increased with m and a values being lower and higher respectively. The limitations of the Rassweiler & Withrow method for calculating Mfb are: <enote>CHEUNG. M.H, & HEYWOOD. J.B, "Evalutation of one-zone burn rate analysis procedure using production SI Engine pressure data" SAE paper 932749, 1993 </enote>The method is usually used with constant polytropic index The mass burn profile automatically goes to unity The method does not account for crevices which are potentially a significant source of unburned hydrocarbons, & hence incomplete combustion The heat transfer is not explicitly accounted for The method does not give information about the temperature of the cylinder gases, which would be useful for many aspects of engineering performance. From the Mfb graphs in Appendix 2 it can be seen that for most of the operating conditions tested it is possible to model the Mfb using the Weibe function accurately to the Mfb found using the Rassweiler & Withrow method. <figure/><heading>Conclusion</heading>Using cylinder pressure against crank angle data it is possible to examine the performance of an engine. From just these simple measurements a detailed understanding of the engines characteristics can be achieved. Mathematical models of the combustion process can be produced using the Weibe function, which have been shown to closely match those found using the Rassweiler & Withrow method. This Weibe function is able to make accurate predictions of the Mfb of a particular engine design enabling the engineer to design engine parameters to meet specific combustion requirements ensuring more efficient and powerful engines. A deeper understanding of some of the practical limitations of the SI engine design has been gained. The significance of ignition timing on the engines performance has been discussed, looking at the on-set of "knock" in the engine and its prevention. Successful modern engine designs have to balance many variable parameters in order to attain high power output & efficiency whilst meeting the increasingly stringent emission regulations. A detailed analysis of the Rover K16 engine has been produced using data obtained from engine tests using the CADET and AVL Indimeter systems. Performance data for the engine has been produced and accompanies this report.
