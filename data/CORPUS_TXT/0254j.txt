<heading>Introduction</heading>A design methodology for a gearbox is presented in this report. The input horse power, the input speed and net reductions in the gearbox are the parameters to be specified. A gearbox takes an input shaft rotating and converts it via a gear train into up to three outputs, the process of designing a gearbox is to figure out which ratios are needed and to implement those ratios in the form of positioning various sizes of connected gears. The specification of the gearbox depends on its area of application. In this report, a gearbox is designed for a commercial meat slicer which has its final shaft rotating at between 80 and 100 rev/min. The input of the meat slicer is a constant speed AC motor running at 1800 rev/min and delivering 1.2 kW. A few points have to be considered on this system, the size of the gearbox is severe restricted, since it has to go onto a work surface where there is severe competition for space. And the motor may be in-line or at right angles to the grinder. Furthermore, the duty is expected to be up to 6 hours per day. In this design, firstly, the gear ration was decided, and a specimen manual calculation was taken to check bending and surface stress, the result was compared with Gears Program. After that, according to the calculated gear teeth loads, the design of shaft and bearings were discussed. Finally, the designed gearbox was drawn in Solidworks. <heading>Gearbox design</heading><heading>1. Gear ratio</heading>First of all, a suitable gear ratio has to be found out. According to equations:  FORMULA  FORMULA  Where U is the gear ratio. From the specification of the meat slicer, the output of the gearbox is a rotating shaft with speed between 80 and 100 rev/min. And the input is a running motor with speed of 1800 rev/min. The gear ratio can be calculated as below:  FORMULA  or  FORMULA  Therefore, gear ration is located between 18 and 22.5. As we know, if the gear ratio is greater than about 4 to 1, it is better try a compound train or planetary gear system. In this exercise, a two-stage straight spur gearbox was chosen for the meat slicer. And the gear ratio for each stage was 4 and 5 respectively, which has got sum gear ratio of 20. Figure 1 shows the layout of the gearbox. <picture/><heading>2. Design the pinion with manual calculation</heading>The gear pair is designed based on the pinion because it is the pinion that is stressed more and is the one most likely to fail, the corresponding gear can be selected accordingly. The number of teeth on the pinion was assumed to be 15, the module was assumed to be 3. And pressure angle was set to 20°, since it is almost universal. Since  FORMULA , where  FORMULA  is Pitch Diameter, and  FORMULA  is Number of teeth.  FORMULA  As teeth and pitch diameter of the pinion was known, it can also work out teeth and pitch diameter of the wheel.  FORMULA  Pitch diameter = 3×60 = 180mm Therefore, a typical addendum and dedendum were worked out as well. A form of Involute tooth is shown in Figure 2. Addendum = 3 mm Dedendum = 1.25×3 = 3.75 mm And Base diameter = Pitch diameter ×cosφ = 45 mm ×cos20° = 42 mm Diameter of addendum circle = 45 mm + 3 mm = 48 mm The gear ratio of this pair of gears is 4, then the diameter of addendum circle of the wheel is: Diameter of addendum circle (Wheel) = 48 mm × 4 = 192 mm The centre distance is:  FORMULA  <heading>Bending Stresses</heading><picture/>According to equation:  FORMULA  = torque ×angular velocity =  FORMULA  And Power =1.2kW,  FORMULA  Therefore,  FORMULA  The simplified bending stress equation is writing in the form  FORMULA . Where Y is the Lewis Form Factor. Table 1 shows the Lewis Form Factor at 20° full-depth. From the table, Y is 0.29 <table/>in this specimen manual calculation. And practical values for face width (b) is  FORMULA  and  FORMULA  Assuming b = 9m = 27 mm Therefore, bending stress is  FORMULA  <heading>Contact Stresses</heading>The modified form of contact stress is shown as below:  FORMULA  Where velocity factor  FORMULA  =6/(6+4.5) =0.57 And  FORMULA , E is Young's modulus of the material, typically, grey cast iron or steel are selected as material for gears. In this calculation, E is assumed as Young's modulus of grey cast iron with 105GPa, so  FORMULA  Then,  FORMULA  <heading>3. Gears Program</heading>Design using the Gears Program. The input was set up to the gears program using the design specification and the manual calculation, like values of power, pinion speed, gear ratio, minimum teeth and duty. Those data put into the Gears Program was similar as the manual calculation I did in the last section, the result is shown in Figure 3. <picture/>Since the face width in the manual calculation was assumed as 27 mm, and some other data were modified slightly, the result from the Gears Program was slightly different. Such as pitch circle diameter, outside diameter and root diameter. The face width from the Gears Program was 13 mm, and its limits were between 27 and 39 mm. Therefore, the face width was too low, material quality, module or centre distance had to be decreased to satisfy the face width. Trying different module and material of gears for many times, a satisfied result were obtained. Figure 4 shows the suitable design. The module was decreased to 2, and the material was choosing mild steel instead of cast iron. <picture/><heading>4. Shaft design</heading>The three shafts are assumed to be made of mild steel, carbon steel and alloy steel. The lengths of the shafts are fixed by the face width of the gears and appropriate clearances, the severe constraint of gearbox size is considered as well. The shafts are required to transmit the torque, as well as withstanding the bending stresses due to the gear teeth loads and bearing reactions. There is no axial loading on the shaft because the gears are spur gears. Assuming the length of the shaft within the gearbox housing is 130 mm. Three shafts had to be analysised, and two sets of bending moment diagrams for horizontal and vertical planes were considered. <heading>Input shaft</heading>From the result of Gears Program, the tangential force for the input shaft is 397.9N, radial force is 144.8N, which denotes that: <figure/>F 1=397.9N, and F 2=144.8N And torque is equal to the tangential force times pinion radius end, Torque = 397.9N × 37.2/2 mm = 7.4Nm Well, the reaction force R 1, R 2, R 3 and R 4 can be calculated respectively, regarding to each fixed ends. <list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list>Therefore, the bending moment and shear force diagrams for the two planes are described as below: <figure/>From those diagrams, the maximum bending moment of two planes were achieved, and  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  =  FORMULA  According to maximum-shear-stress theory:  FORMULA  Then  FORMULA   FORMULA  We can choose 10mm. <heading>Output shaft</heading>From the result of Gears Program, the tangential force for the input shaft is 943.1N, radial force is 343.3N, which denotes that: <figure/>F3=943.1N, and F4=343.3N And torque is equal to the tangential force times wheel radius end, Torque = 943.1N × 274.08/2 mm = 129.2Nm Well, the reaction force R5, R6, R7 and R8 can be calculated respectively, regarding to each fixed ends. <list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list>Therefore, the bending moment and shear force diagrams for the two planes are described as below: <figure/>In the same way as input shaft, the diameter of the output shaft is:  FORMULA  We can choose 20mm. <heading>The middle shaft</heading>From the analysis of last two shafts, the tangential forces for the middle shaft are 397.9N and 943.1N respectively, the radial forces are 144.8N and 343.3N respectively. It is denoted as below. <figure/>Since <list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list>And, the reaction force R5, R6, R7 and R8 can be calculated respectively, regarding to each fixed ends. <list> FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA </list>And there are two torques in this shaft, Torque = (397.9N × 130.8/2mm) + (943.1N × 61.92/2mm) = 55Nm Therefore, the bending moment and shear force diagrams for the two planes are described as below: <figure/>In the same way as input shaft, the diameter of the middle shaft is:  FORMULA  We can choose 15mm. The shaft program was tried to calculate the deflection due to bending forces, unfortunately, the program failed to proceed after the data was input. The failed shaft program was shown in Figure 5. <picture/><heading>5. Bearing design</heading>In this design, rolling element bearings were chosen for the shaft. Single-row and double-row cylindrical roller bearings were used to support the shafts at the two ends depending on the boundary conditions. The single-row bearings were used at the hinged ends and the double-row ones at the fixed ends. The Solidworks of the gearbox is attached.
