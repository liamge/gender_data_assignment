<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>Sodium chloride content in foods can be determined by titrating the chloride ion with silver, and excess silver ions with potassium chromate. The end point occurs when all the chloride ions are complexed and the excess silver ions react with the chromate ion to form the orange color of silver chromate. The endpoint in this reaction is therefore at the first hint of an orange color.  FORMULA  <heading>METHOD</heading>The method was completed after following the instructions of the Laboratory handout, without any alterations. <heading>RESULTS - CALCULATIONS</heading>We first had to do a determination of the concentration of a standard sodium chloride solution. This was done after titrating 20 ml of the sodium chloride solution provided, with standard silver nitrate solution using potassium chromate indicator (5% solution), until the red colour formed begins to fade more slowly. <table/>Actual concentration of sodium chloride solution:  FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA   FORMULA  For the determination of salt in a sample of butter we weighed 3.0520 g of butter and followed the procedure described in the handout. After the 3 extractions of salt from the fat using hot water, we titrated 25 ml aliquot of the diluted extract (adding 1 ml of potassium chromate indicator) with standard silver nitrate. The results of this titration was: <table/>To calculate the percentage of NaCl in the butter:  FORMULA   FORMULA  Total salt:  FORMULA  <heading>DISCUSSION</heading>The result obtained for the % of salt in the butter is considered as satisfactory as most butter have a concentration of 1.5-2.0 % of salt. An error that may have altered the results is based on the fact that during the extractions, it has been calculated that you get only the 90 % of the amount that you are required to extract. As the number of extractions grows, so does the percentage of error. So, in the 1 st extraction we get the 90% of the aqueous phase, in the 2 nd extraction we get the 90% of the 1 st extract and in the 3 rd extraction we get the 90% of the 2 nd extract. In this case, when we refer to an error, we refer to the amount of the liquid phase (aqueous phase) that we were not able to extract. Some other errors may also occur. A common error is the sampling error which is partly avoided by the use of more than one sample when titrating. Limitations due to the uncertainty of the instruments also exist but we consider them as not significant when doing our calculations. After obtaining the results from the other teams, we constructed a diagram showing the differences in the percentages of salt in butter found by all teams in terms of 95% confidence limits (+/- 2 SE).  FORMULA , where Ïƒ = standard deviation and n = sample number So we had: <table/><figure/>As we can see most of the results are between these confidence limits. For the critical values, such as the one in sample 8 (2.1%), we can justify them by referring to the error that is described above and is referring to the extraction method error.
